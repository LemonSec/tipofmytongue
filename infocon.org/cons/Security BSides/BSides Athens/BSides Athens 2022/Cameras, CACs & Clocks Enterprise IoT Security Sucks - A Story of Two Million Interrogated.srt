1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
hey everybody i'm brian cantos i'm the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
chief security officer with phosphorus

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
cyber security

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
today's presentation is cameras cachs

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
and clocks enterprise iot security sucks

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
uh this is a story of two million

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,960
interrogated iot devices this slide i

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,039
just said yikes i didn't really know

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,560
what else to call it so i went over to

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
showdown and i think most of you are

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,599
familiar with that the showdown search

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,960
engine to see which devices are um

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,280
internet accessible if you will uh and i

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
just typed in a couple terms that you

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
would think of for iot devices i've got

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,079
camera

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
voice over ip

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
uh printer and ups so not very

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,399
scientific just typed them in but what

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,280
we find here is almost 5 million cameras

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
you know over 250 000 voice over ip

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
phones uh you know 83 000 plus printers

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
and almost 14 000 ups systems which oh

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,879
my gosh and the thing about ups systems

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,640
i won't tell you but you can google this

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,960
the password is almost never changed and

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
it's a very very simple password on

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,960
these it's actually the same credential

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
for username and password on these

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
devices i don't know why they would be

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
exposed on the internet but

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
iot devices don't need to be exposed to

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,479
the internet for these attacks to happen

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,240
but certainly the fact that many of them

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,360
are increased the likelihood

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,960
also we're seeing a lot of nation states

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,439
now paying attention to iot and

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
investing quite a bit

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
and this is globally so

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
russia has this tool called frontend

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,439
which was developed for them by some

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
contractors specifically for the russian

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,240
fsb and this was an iot hacking tool

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
designed to find

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,399
compromise

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
and compromise iot devices install

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
command and control software and do

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
whatever they wanted from that point or

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
also use that as a jumping off point to

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,680
get in deeper into organizations

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
interestingly a hacking group called

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,119
digital revolution got their hands on

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,240
frontend

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
and released the code so you can get it

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
from torrents and all the all the places

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,640
that you like to get your hacking tools

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
from

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,318
another interesting case is uh there

59
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
have been iot devices that have been

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,760
banned actually the us house of

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
representative has passed bills that

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,840
prohibit federal agencies and

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
contractors from actually using certain

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
iot devices so i mean they're that well

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,879
known to have that level of

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
vulnerability that they're they're just

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
not allowed our research what we've

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
actually discovered and this these

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
numbers actually blew me away before i

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
really started getting involved with

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
these organizations

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
there's about three to five iot devices

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
per employee so this is the the craziest

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,239
looking uh possible chart to show that

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
but if you just look at ten thousand

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
employees for example ten thousand

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,319
employees you probably have somewhere

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,319
between thirty thousand and fifty

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
thousand iot devices that's a lot of

80
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
devices and it's way more devices than

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
you could possibly manually manage in

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
terms of taking care of the firmware and

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
taking care of the passwords and turning

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,319
off

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,800
unneeded services it's just completely

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
untenable you need automated tools you

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
need a centralized process to handle

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
that but it just kind of shows you the

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
breadth and depth of this problem now if

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
you look at law firms for example

91
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
they'll have a little bit less you look

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
at retailers they'll actually have quite

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,519
a bit more so it kind of depends on

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,840
industry but on average take a look at

95
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,519
your organization there's probably about

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
three to five iot devices per employee

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
right and we'll get into some of the iot

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
devices that we see quite a bit of in

99
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,159
the worst offenders and you'll start

100
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
going okay yeah if i start including

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
these things i can completely see how

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
that goes

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
and just like with the stock exchange we

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
were talking about those cesium clocks

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,959
when we go into organizations to do a

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,440
proof of value and we say hey how many

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
devices do you think you have iot

108
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
devices and they'll say i don't know i

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
have x

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
almost a hundred percent of the time

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
their numbers are off by about forty to

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
sixty percent so again they just didn't

113
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
know about half of their devices in

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
their environment

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
so we talked about printers a little bit

116
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
before printers are

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,879
really a special case because everyone's

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,480
got them and everyone's got a lot of

119
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,319
them we work with some folks in the

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,080
hospitality industry for example where

121
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,879
they have tens and tens of thousands of

122
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
printers just printers different models

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
and brands and you know versions and

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
things like that but they have lots of

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,798
printers now the thing about printers is

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
most sort of enterprise level printers

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
have about a 20 gig hard drive it's not

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
huge it's not small but it's a pretty

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
good size hard drive

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
and what had happened is some attackers

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,880
had gotten access to these these

132
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
printers

133
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
which by the way most of these are

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
uncommon operating systems like linux or

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
android and things of this nature in

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,919
fact across all iot a flavor of linux or

137
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,680
a flavor of android is by far the most

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
common thing that you'll find and by the

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,639
way they have a lot of the same

140
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
capabilities services um in the case of

141
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
printers however they're far more

142
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,960
promiscuous in running so many different

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
protocols they've got every protocol

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
imaginable because they want to be easy

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
to use they want people to be able to

146
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
connect to them and use them it's the

147
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
point of the printer so from that

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
perspective it makes great sense but

149
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
attackers know that and because they

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
know that they take advantage of the

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
fact that those printers are so

152
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,440
promiscuous and there are so many ways

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
to connect with them so

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
in this particular case some attackers

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
had gained access to the printer they

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
had uploaded some of their tools this

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
was only to a few dozen printers at the

158
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
time but it did expand greatly to

159
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
hundreds later on

160
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
and they used those to go out searching

161
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
for other critical devices on the

162
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,919
network i t devices primarily and from

163
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,680
them they were extracting data this was

164
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
all about um intellectual property theft

165
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
they were extracting the data and then

166
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
they were storing it on those 20 gig

167
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
hard drives and i'll get to what happens

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
next well a lot of this activity because

169
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
it was all being controlled through

170
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
various remote connectivity uh controls

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,919
and and c2 and things of that nature

172
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,759
it created logs and those logs were

173
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
showing up in splunk and they were

174
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,039
anomalous they said hey we've got a lot

175
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
of printers that seem to be pretty

176
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
chatty and we're not really sure why and

177
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,120
then what they were seeing was data

178
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,479
exfiltration

179
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,160
and these printers

180
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
they were being set up to exfil data

181
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
over icmp why because everybody allows

182
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,199
icmpo and even if it's shut off network

183
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,880
ops turns it back on to do some testing

184
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
they forget to turn it off just a really

185
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
easy way to exfiltrate data you have to

186
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
make the packets pretty small takes a

187
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
little bit longer but it usually goes

188
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
under the radar so you're using these

189
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
printers to grab it sensitive data

190
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
compressing it up exfiltrating out over

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,039
icmp which eventually caused some alarms

192
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
to to go up and what they found was when

193
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,479
they started looking at these printers

194
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,919
and say god it's not just one or two

195
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
it's we have several dozen now more than

196
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
100 now they're infected

197
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
it was just the firmware they're running

198
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,080
really old firmware some of these

199
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
devices hadn't been updated in uh up to

200
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,919
10 years most of them hadn't been

201
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
upgraded for about four or five years at

202
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
least so they were just sitting there

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
vulnerable they were doing their job

204
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,639
they're working fine as printers and

205
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
usually most people don't pay attention

206
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,240
to a printer until it stops well

207
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
printing so the fact that they are

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,080
running all this old firmware just made

209
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
them a big target

210
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
with a big juicy hard drive and an easy

211
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
way to exfiltrate that data out

212
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,160
now talking about firmware about 26 of

213
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
the devices we counter

214
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
have end of life firmware meaning that

215
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
there's just just nothing we can do with

216
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
that firmware it's completely end of

217
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
life if you're running it you have to

218
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,520
get on a newer version of it

219
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
of the remaining 74 the average age was

220
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,960
six years old um think about your

221
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
smartphone it probably wouldn't work if

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
you hadn't updated

223
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
things in six years and i'm almost

224
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
certain it wouldn't work um but now

225
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
you're talking about your enterprise

226
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
devices again all of your key systems

227
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
especially the systems that manage other

228
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
systems and that's a really a scary step

229
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,319
because if we think about it again

230
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
there's not a lot of difference between

231
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
an it device and an iot device in terms

232
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
of capability network access and the

233
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
type of negative ramifications it can

234
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,400
cause upon your environment and again

235
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
with iot you can even cause physical

236
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,960
harm

237
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
so if i went and told you 26 percent of

238
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
your it devices were our end of life

239
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
firmware you'd jump off this video right

240
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,639
now and you go fix those that's how

241
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,240
serious this is

242
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
so when we start digging into the actual

243
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
statistics around the vulnerabilities

244
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
what we found and this is this is

245
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,759
probably one of the the most frightening

246
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,479
statistics so far

247
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
the cbss scores so scores of of 1 to 10

248
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,759
10 being the most grievous 50 of the

249
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
devices have a score of an eight

250
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
in additional 18

251
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
have scores of nine or ten these are

252
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
high to critical level vulnerabilities

253
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,479
these are the type of vulnerabilities

254
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
where you don't need local access

255
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
you can do remote exploitation they're

256
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,800
very

257
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,279
they're very severe the great majority

258
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
of the vulnerabilities discovered on

259
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,440
these devices were eights nines and tens

260
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,679
that's a scary thought again this is one

261
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
of those things where if this these were

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
your it devices you'd be like oh my god

263
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,959
what can i do

264
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
but because iot devices historically

265
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
have been so hard to first of all just

266
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,880
discover

267
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
then manage then manage the passwords

268
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
address the vulnerabilities in the

269
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
patching and the firmware

270
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
managed services etc

271
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
nothing's been done

272
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
let's dive into the biggest iot

273
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
offenders and these are the devices

274
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
where we see sort of the most grievous

275
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
issues across the board now we see a lot

276
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
of other devices that i'm not listing

277
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
here

278
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,080
but uh you know we just had to sort of

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
condense it into the the ones that keep

280
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
on ringing out as being problematic

281
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
again the the pictures that you see here

282
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
are not the actual brands i'm not not

283
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
going to call anybody out here that's

284
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
not the focus here but kvm switches

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
again most of you are probably familiar

286
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
with kvm switches

287
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
but kvm switch you stick it in a rack

288
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,040
you connect it to

289
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
multiple computers and it lets you

290
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
control um keyboard and mouse and video

291
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,200
and sometimes you can cycle power as

292
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,360
well we come across a lot of these

293
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
devices that are running like linux

294
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
ubuntu version 10. well that's from 2010

295
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,640
right i think the latest version now is

296
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
21 point something it's a little bit

297
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
past 21.1

298
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,640
um so this is it's running old stuff and

299
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
because of that it doesn't just have a

300
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,040
few but they have a hundreds hundreds of

301
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
vulnerabilities

302
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
now think about this i've spent a lot of

303
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
money on my endpoint security and

304
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
application security identity this and

305
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
network security that and now i've got

306
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
this kvm switch that can back door into

307
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
all these devices running a version of

308
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,399
linux that's uh

309
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,360
more than a decade old

310
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
that if i'm an attacker and i can

311
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
compromise that i can do a lot of

312
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
malicious things so those devices that

313
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
are connected i can probably power them

314
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,079
off i can change configurations i can

315
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,640
you know modify stuff steal stuff

316
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
whatever i wanted to do so that's a huge

317
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
back door and that's one of the reasons

318
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,680
that a lot of nation states and we

319
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
talked about russia earlier are building

320
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
these tools because why bang your head

321
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
through the firewall and the ips and the

322
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
encryption that and application security

323
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,920
and endpoint security when i can just

324
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
go around that back door again like 1995

325
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
with that u.s robotics modem plugged

326
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
into the back of that windows nt 351

327
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,079
server in the back of the data center

328
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
that everybody forgot about right

329
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
so kvm switch is one of the biggest

330
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
offenders that we see out there

331
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
another big one lights out management

332
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
controls um so if you look at the back

333
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
of this

334
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
of this server we see a couple ethernet

335
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
ports on the right and something that

336
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,079
looks like an ethernet port where that

337
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,839
arrow is well that's not an ethernet

338
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,720
port

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,480
that's a lights out management port

340
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
right that's that's what you're going to

341
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,839
use for management these devices

342
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,519
well the thing thing about these is

343
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,040
there's a few different flavors there's

344
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
hp has ilo

345
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,920
dell has idrac

346
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,560
super micro has ipmi

347
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
uh so there's a few different flavors

348
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
those are the main ones they're just

349
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
little linux servers in fact there's

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
malware specifically designed to target

351
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
those little linux servers for lights

352
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
out management systems and again like

353
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,480
the kvm switches but a little bit more

354
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
powerful actually these lights out

355
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
management controls bypass all that

356
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
other security that you put on top of

357
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
that server so you could have 10 million

358
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
dollars of endpoint security on top of

359
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,519
this thing but if that interface isn't

360
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
secure if it's running a default

361
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
password for example or a weak password

362
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
or it has a vulnerability in it that can

363
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
be exploited because that version of

364
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,680
linux or vx work that's running on that

365
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
has not been updated in the last 10

366
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
years

367
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
that's a problem because now as an

368
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,560
attacker the things i can do for that is

369
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
i can shut the system down i can change

370
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,519
the network settings i can run a shell

371
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
some of these guys i can pop open a

372
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,760
virtual terminal as well i can upload

373
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,959
software or malware i can do all the bad

374
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,000
stuff

375
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
that an attacker would want to do

376
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
and again most of your critical servers

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
are going to have these devices

378
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
and some people say oh well you know

379
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
i don't even know that thing was there

380
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,440
and that's the problem again because

381
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,279
there's no good inventory for discovery

382
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
for a lot of these a lot of these

383
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,399
products

384
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,320
server cabinets and racks this is

385
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
another one that people tend to go oh

386
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
those do have a lot of iot devices they

387
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
sure do ups systems which are notorious

388
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,079
for having the vendor's default password

389
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,680
which takes about five seconds to find

390
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
if you google it cooling systems cable

391
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,639
management tamper resistance um sensors

392
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
and all sorts of other things depending

393
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,160
on how fancy that rack happens to be and

394
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,120
they're really cool and they're really

395
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,600
capable they're almost always running

396
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
the oldest firmware known to man

397
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,240
and the reason for that i think the

398
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
primary reason is if i want to upload

399
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,399
all the firmware on my rack including my

400
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
ups system everything else i need to

401
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,639
reboot that system in most cases which

402
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,959
means all those devices that are relying

403
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,760
on that switching gear routing gear

404
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,920
computer systems etc they're going to

405
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,040
have to be

406
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,959
rebooted as well so there has to be a

407
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,639
change window and when people schedule

408
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,920
change windows they don't always think

409
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,320
about iot devices unfortunately which

410
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
causes this problem so these devices are

411
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
frequently frequently vulnerable and a

412
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
lot of these are also tied to kvm

413
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
switches that we talked about earlier

414
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
exposing you to a lot of problems

415
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,519
physical access controllers here's

416
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,880
another case where you probably have

417
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,639
oodles and noodles of these throughout

418
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
your environment whether it's biometrics

419
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,320
or

420
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,639
you know a pin or a scan card or a cac

421
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
system whatever the solution might be

422
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
again these are these are linux devices

423
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
that are that are running on the network

424
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
and in one particular case

425
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,639
we're working with a customer

426
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,839
and they had uh the system deployed

427
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,440
it was uh

428
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,519
it was all default passwords but if

429
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
those passwords were not default and

430
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
it's crazy to find the default passwords

431
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
on door locks

432
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
it's crazy to think but you always find

433
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,120
it

434
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,519
they had three critical cpes so had that

435
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
default password

436
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,279
not been there it would have been easy

437
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,320
enough to get through one of the

438
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
critical seats one of the three you

439
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
could pick the one that you like most to

440
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
get into that system

441
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
and we're sitting with the cso and

442
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
their team and we're actually able to

443
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,480
show them with a click of a button we

444
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,519
could have locked or unlocked all 6400

445
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,199
doors door lock systems that they had

446
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,480
throughout this financial services

447
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
company

448
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,120
and again the iot tax iot devices can

449
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,880
have that impact on the physical world

450
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,320
printers we talked a little bit about

451
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
printers before they're certainly one of

452
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
the most commonly attacked

453
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
devices especially from nation states

454
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,040
but cyber criminals like them too

455
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
if any of you were at black hat back in

456
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
2019 in vegas

457
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
there was some research that was

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
released where they found critical level

459
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
vulnerabilities again these are level 10

460
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
vulnerabilities on over 10 000 different

461
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
printer types and brands and there's

462
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,920
just so many different types of printers

463
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,760
out there but that's that's pretty

464
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,800
incredible over over 10 000 devices had

465
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,959
critical level vulnerabilities and again

466
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,320
they're highly promiscuous they're

467
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,480
running a lot of services they've got

468
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
wired and wired list connections they

469
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,920
probably have bluetooth they might be

470
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
running other other protocols as well

471
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,880
you can manage it via https or ssh some

472
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
of you can tell that into they're just

473
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
very very open and that's taking

474
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
advantage and again because a lot of

475
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,959
them have that big storage drive

476
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
it's great to use them to attack it

477
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,279
devices and exfiltrate your data out the

478
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
way we talked about it before but again

479
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
it's one of the biggest targets

480
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
for state sponsored hackers i would say

481
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
it's probably in the top three

482
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,000
next one voiceover ip phones and video

483
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
conferencing systems

484
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,600
like printers

485
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
organizations have a ton of voice over

486
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
ip systems um and even when people

487
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
weren't at

488
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
at the office there's still so many

489
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,600
active iot systems that we actually saw

490
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
an uptick in the number of attacks on

491
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
iot devices but now i guess they're

492
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,199
calling it the great return here in

493
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,120
silicon valley we see you know the likes

494
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,440
of apple and facebook and google people

495
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,519
are are all going back to work again

496
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,880
traffic's increasing because of that

497
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
which is usually a pretty good sign

498
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
probably an iot device could detect that

499
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
but there's a lot of these voice over ip

500
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,320
phones and they're usually running a

501
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,399
flavor of android

502
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,639
what we find with a lot of these devices

503
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
is they've got undocumented ssh

504
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
administration capabilities running on

505
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,399
them with default credentials again

506
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,839
and a lot of this goes back to what we

507
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,440
were talking about before with the

508
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
manufacturers of some of these devices

509
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
aren't necessarily software development

510
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,440
houses they're more they manufacture

511
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
things sometimes like farm equipment and

512
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
things of that nature

513
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
so they have a small crew

514
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
they're not putting a lot of time and

515
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
effort into into testing certainly not

516
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,599
looking at security if they are it's

517
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,959
very little

518
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,160
and because of that they're saying well

519
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
i'm just going to white label that i'm

520
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
going to use that library from that

521
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
group and they might not even know they

522
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,959
have that undocumented

523
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
um ssh with default credentials right

524
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,079
and they it just got rolled out that way

525
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,359
because they hadn't done that level of

526
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
testing so that's a that's a pretty

527
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
scary thing um with this one

528
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,960
organization i guess you can call this a

529
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,320
beacon of hope but maybe it's kind of

530
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,640
sad they had 31 000 phones

531
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,840
only 700 only 700 had a critical level

532
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,039
cve

533
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,200
as we know it really only takes one so

534
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,679
these again are uh an example of

535
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,120
something that there's just so many

536
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
they're so voluminous 31 000 phone

537
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
systems if you wanted to upgrade the

538
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,760
firmware or rotate the passwords every

539
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
90 days that you used for managing those

540
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
or whatever steps it would be impossible

541
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,280
to try to do these things manually

542
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
and then the last group i wanted to

543
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,200
cover were secure our security cameras

544
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
these suck the most

545
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,280
there's so many of them and there's so

546
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
many problems again some of these

547
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
cameras shipped directly from their

548
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,559
manufacturers with the malware already

549
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,320
installed so you skip the middleman you

550
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,080
just go straight to straight to being

551
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,200
infected and having your device

552
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
controlled

553
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
these cameras have been known to

554
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,840
actually turn on when they're supposed

555
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
to be off they're known to record audio

556
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
when they're supposed to be on you and

557
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,360
they also take these streams and they

558
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
can pipe them back

559
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
to various countries so that's a problem

560
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
right there again a lot of these devices

561
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
have been banned but cameras are devices

562
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,799
that if they're compromised they can

563
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,039
certainly be used for spying

564
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,640
we mentioned some of the attacks that

565
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
are very common in it and iot and how

566
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,880
they're the same from ransomware to data

567
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
theft ddos command and control uh

568
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
malware distribution things of that

569
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
nature

570
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,720
one case we were working with a customer

571
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,360
i think they had something like 9000 or

572
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,039
nine thousand five hundred a lot they

573
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,440
had a lot of video cameras and they had

574
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,760
been crypto checked uh which most of you

575
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
probably know that means i wanna take

576
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
this device and i wanna use it to mine

577
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,799
crypto so they had all these cameras

578
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,039
that were doing crypto mining um and the

579
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
way they detected it i'd love to say it

580
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,720
was some cool sim tool or alerted this

581
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
it was their power bill their power bill

582
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
was really really high and they didn't

583
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
know why if you've ever looked at

584
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
organizations that do crypto mining it's

585
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,000
uh it's pretty

586
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
energy intensive so that's how they

587
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,360
found it um these guys are usually

588
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
running linux usually it's some form of

589
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
like busybox which is a common a common

590
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,039
piece that's on there

591
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,320
and the thing that's interesting about

592
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
video cameras is a lot of the older ones

593
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,280
are designed so i have 10 000 cameras

594
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
but they all have to have the exact same

595
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,640
password that's talking to the

596
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
management console like something like

597
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
you see here in the middle

598
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,640
um

599
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
which

600
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
which is an architectural flaw i mean

601
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,240
you could set it up and there's some

602
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
newer ones where you have the streaming

603
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
password is the same but the management

604
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
password is different so it has two

605
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
different passwords uh because of that

606
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,080
issue so when you're talking about

607
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,559
password management on these things uh

608
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
you have to keep in mind that hey if

609
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
you're if you are gonna change the

610
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,880
password and use something complicated

611
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,480
now i have to do it for all 10 000

612
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
devices and it has to be the same thing

613
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,000
it has to be a group password again from

614
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
a secure perspective not a great design

615
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
but sometimes you have to work within

616
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
the limitations of those devices as well

617
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
so again virtually every organization

618
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
has hundreds if not thousands or even

619
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
tens of thousands of these types of

620
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
devices there's often finger pointing

621
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
when it comes to cameras well i thought

622
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,880
facilities took care of that no i

623
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,640
thought i t did no i think it was

624
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,559
supposed to be security and it's kind of

625
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,760
like spider-man right they're all

626
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
pointing at each other it just

627
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
it it's just very

628
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,520
commonly

629
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
um targeted

630
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
and they tend to be very easy to take

631
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,760
advantage of and on the consumer side

632
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
again we're not focusing too much on the

633
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,000
consumer side here but one of the most

634
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
popular cameras on amazon last year most

635
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
popular camera highest rated you know

636
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
approved this and that

637
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,799
shipped with malware already installed

638
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,760
on it to summarize um

639
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,640
you know iot devices they're virtually

640
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
always vulnerable

641
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,280
i wish

642
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,799
i wish there was another another way to

643
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,039
say that it just sucks hence the title

644
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,559
of the presentation

645
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,320
um historically it was really hard to

646
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
just find these devices just say i don't

647
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
even know what i have i know i got a

648
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
bunch of cameras and some door locks i

649
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
think and

650
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,919
lights out management i hadn't even

651
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,760
thought of that but just finding them

652
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
that's that's a problem then the next

653
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,520
step of course is once they're found

654
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
remediating the risks which is the

655
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
bigger part of the equation right i just

656
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
don't want to find it i want to fix that

657
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,640
and then i want to keep it fixed

658
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
right so that's really important

659
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
now there's solutions to help with this

660
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
right enterprise iot security platforms

661
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
somewhat of a newer concept in this

662
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
world and i put a couple versions down

663
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
here of course this is something that

664
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,240
phosphorus does but we're not the only

665
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,559
people that play in iot security you can

666
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,600
take a look at some of these other

667
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,039
vendors everybody has a little bit of a

668
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,640
different approach to this some a little

669
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
bit more legacy some a little bit more

670
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,679
modern

671
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,120
but now these tools can help you

672
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,799
discovering the device and what

673
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,880
vulnerabilities are on my device

674
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,799
updating my firmware

675
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,400
managing those credentials and those

676
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
certificates and hardening those devices

677
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
and then what's really critical is

678
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
integrating with all my other it

679
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
security tools for logging

680
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
for soar capability for ticketing

681
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,120
systems and then being able to pull all

682
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
that together with a reporting

683
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,760
capability

684
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
that makes this

685
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,679
easy for me to manage at scale

686
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,280
if you're able to do this not only are

687
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
you able to sort of discover your iot

688
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,240
environment and lock it down but you're

689
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
able to do it at scale

690
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
with these automated tools and make

691
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
these devices secure you're just not

692
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
hiding them off in a vlan just not

693
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,840
closing your eyes and hoping nothing bad

694
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,679
is going to happen and you're greatly

695
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,520
reducing the risk on your organization

696
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
with something that's very easy to do

697
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,000
in most cases running discovery from

698
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
these enterprise iot security platforms

699
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
is like running a vulnerability scan

700
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
right the firmware is just kept up there

701
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,039
you don't have to go hunt for the

702
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
firmware yourself the integration api

703
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,799
integration with the pam tools is

704
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,000
already there

705
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
it just works and it just fits so

706
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
something you probably want to check out

707
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,960
if you're trying to address your iot

708
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,440
security so again my name is brian

709
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
cantos i'm the chief security officer

710
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,799
with phosphorus cyber security and

711
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,600
thanks so much for your time
