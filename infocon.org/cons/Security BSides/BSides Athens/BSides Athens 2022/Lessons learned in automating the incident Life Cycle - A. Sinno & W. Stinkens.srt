1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,200
today we're going to talk about lessons

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,120
learned automating the incident life

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
cycle within the context of sock

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
but first i want to make a quick

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
introduction my name is alexander cino

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,720
i'm the head of the in viso fusion

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
center operations

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,560
um i have some experience building

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
security operation centers out in the

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,279
middle east

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,080
previously i used to work for the

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
largest mssp in the world

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,200
known as dell secure works

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
as a senior intrusion analyst and before

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
that i was in the united states military

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,040
as a

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,200
fire support specialist

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
and i would like to also introduce my

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
colleague who's a co-presenter with me

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
today roger stinkins

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
thank you alex

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
i'll also quickly introduce myself my

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
name is rodriguez i've been working at a

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,000
visa for four years i have a background

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
as a devops engineer and in cloud

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
security as a development engineer big

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
parts of your work is automating stuff

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,479
and that's also what i've been doing as

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,479
the source engineering team leader lm

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
viso

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
all right thank you walter

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,159
just before we dive into the cool stuff

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,600
like the automations and those sort of

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
things we should break down the

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
perspective of why automation is so

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,759
important

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,119
now when you look at the traditional

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,680
sock uh each analyst they have about 20

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
minutes per security event or 20 minutes

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
to handle a security event right now

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
those numbers actually add up quite a

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
bit

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
um most of the time a security uh a sock

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
analyst can actually handle a maximum of

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,600
25 security events per day

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
and the big problem is okay we have a

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,720
huge lack of personnel worldwide so how

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
do we deal with that and we know that

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,159
from our experiences that automation is

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,280
key

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,320
now we took a seven day time span and we

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
calculated that we ingested 647 security

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
events

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
and if you use the math that we

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
displayed above that would take about 26

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
analysts to handle all of that so you do

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
the math and how what type of a cost

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,159
that is

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,199
and now just for you to have 24x7 alone

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
without factoring in all the security

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,599
events you need about 12 analysts

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,879
now

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,959
when we saw those numbers we decided

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
immediately to start automating and

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,840
start assisting the analysts with

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,200
automations the first thing that we saw

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,959
is that our automations actually

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
decreased the analytical workload by

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
97.42

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
of

71
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,680
5790 alerts that we took in that time

72
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
period only

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,760
145 were manually analyzed in seven days

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,599
by the stock

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,040
this reduced cost down to

76
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,160
1483 euros as opposed to 59

77
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,879
251.

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
so the math is there and it makes a lot

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
of sense to handle it this way

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
now now to explain a little bit about

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,280
why this is important and why it's so

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
effective let's look at the traditional

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,680
stock so in a traditional sock this is

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
what you would have you would have

85
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,200
isolated components none of them talking

86
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
to each other and other than working

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
with it with each other

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
so everything in a different silo which

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
increases the number of clicks for an

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
analyst to resolve an incident to find

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
the information that they need

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
significantly and it makes them less apt

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,920
to going into all those individual

94
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,080
devices at the end of the day

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,519
in order to find the information that

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,640
they need

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,519
so

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
what do we do to solve that

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,280
we

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
use a security uh orchestration on an

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
automated response platform called xor

102
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
and we do a lot of development on top of

103
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
it and that way we can actually work

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
with all the different components

105
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
without actually having to go to those

106
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
platforms so we assemble all of the data

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
into one spot where xor will become the

108
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
central nervous system of your entire

109
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,480
security operation center and all of the

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
uh capabilities

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
that uh that are available for for your

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,879
analyst will be built into one uh

113
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
platform so isolating

114
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
machines running anti-virus scans

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
resetting passwords revoking sessions

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
making a phone call

117
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
getting information on what ports are

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
open on a specific device

119
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
am by getting a reputational analysis

120
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
from virustotal from your threat

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
intelligence feeds all in one place for

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
the analyst and just completely handled

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
by automation and presented to them so

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
that it actually takes uh the analyst

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
significantly less time to handle an

126
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
incident because they have a hell of a

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
lot more contacts to work with

128
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
so these are all important factors so

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,120
not only just automating from

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,680
the entire events but also reducing the

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
amount of time and effort that it takes

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,479
an analyst to make a conclusion on a

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,759
particular security event

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
now just to go through a bit

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
about the incident life cycle and the

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
way that we manage it here in viso so we

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,720
put it we built something up at a high

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
level

139
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,240
uh the first step is triaging so we

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
build our integrations into the xor

141
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
platform we only pull in from the

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,960
security and products

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,600
such as the edr and the sim

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,639
and what we do what those are ingested

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,800
we immediately start enriching those

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
events with other various types of data

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,560
so

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
for example we'll take all of the ip

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,400
addresses all of the hashes all of the

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
user accounts the hosts and we'll start

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
converting those into indicators of

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
interest those indicators of interest

153
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
are actually stored in a panel for the

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
analyst for them to be able to see all

155
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
the relevant information that they need

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
now in a lot of cases we even store data

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
inside of the indicators themselves so

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
when we extract a phishing email for

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
example that entire phishing email

160
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,880
sample is actually laid out for the

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,680
analyst inside of xor so no need to jump

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
all the way into another tool just to

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
see the layout of a phishing email so

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
taking it maybe one minute just to

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,520
analyze fishing events now as opposed to

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,160
20 or 30 minutes per each fishing event

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,759
because you gotta jump into

168
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
you know one or two different platforms

169
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,639
to do that

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
now the second step is the incident

171
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
management portion right this is where

172
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,000
you classify events this is where you

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
decide how you want to notify people

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
this is where you want to decide if this

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,319
should go to an analyst right now and it

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,560
does a hell of a lot of filtering

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
and and then it goes into the analysis

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,919
phase the analysis phase we tried to do

179
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560
as much automation as possible without

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,440
uh

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
adding additional risk onto our customer

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
base or

183
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,160
into any of the customer environments so

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,479
we don't automate where it's not

185
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
practical and not wise to do so now um

186
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,479
basically a lot of the full automations

187
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
that we do

188
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
are

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
checklists that analysts would do anyway

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
so they're manual steps that we fully

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
automate

192
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,479
uh one great example is called the

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
access anomaly classification which

194
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
we've built and from that

195
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,479
we're able to fully automate the

196
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
analysis of an impossible travel

197
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
activity and we can do it significantly

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
faster than a human being

199
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,479
and

200
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
most times it's either something

201
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,520
interesting

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
or a compromised account that comes in

203
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,479
so

204
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,120
when that is done we then we um we then

205
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
notify the customer through ticketing

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,800
through phone calls

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
um through other various uh methods

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
and then we determine do we need to

209
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
destroy the actor now is there something

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
in here that we need to do so again do

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
we want to revoke a session do we want

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
to isolate a machine and how do we give

213
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
those tools to a socket analyst so that

214
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
they can start taking action now and

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,520
this

216
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
these components is what makes a

217
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
traditional sock or you know

218
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,800
it's the difference between a

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
traditional sock and and a future sock

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
which is built on

221
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,879
orchestration and automation and those

222
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,960
are very very key elements

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
now from here i'm going to hand it back

224
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,720
over to walter who's going to talk a

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
little bit about sword development

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,319
okay thank you alexander

227
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,680
as alex said

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,440
i'm going to dive in a bit deeper on how

229
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
to do the soul development

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,919
and

231
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,960
we've been doing um using xor for more

232
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
than three years now and we're currently

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,039
on the third generation of the

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
automation stack and we use cortex exo

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
as an automation platform and then you

236
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,360
have two concepts to actually create

237
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
your automations one is playbooks which

238
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
is drag and drop programming so you can

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,680
actually define a complete automated

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,799
workflow

241
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
but without writing a single line of

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,679
code

243
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
and you have automations there you can

244
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
actually host your own python code and

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,159
do everything in there

246
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,959
generation 1 and generation 2

247
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,279
playbooks and then automation stack we

248
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,560
actually had the principle to do

249
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
everything within playbooks why because

250
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
we wanted our engineers to be able to

251
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
create those playbooks without needing

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
to know python

253
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,560
but

254
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
from experience we've learned this had

255
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,640
some disadvantages mainly performance

256
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,959
now here you can see the a table with

257
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
the how long it would take to for us to

258
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
only do enrichment with playbooks and

259
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
generation 2 and regeneration 3 and with

260
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
by doing as much as possible actually in

261
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
python code

262
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
we had well we have improved performance

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,760
by almost 100 which is well from

264
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
performance perspective insane to to do

265
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
it like that

266
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,519
currently running our entire playbooks

267
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,720
can be done

268
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
while between well at least under one

269
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
minute but we'll show you that after

270
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
at the demo at the end of the

271
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,399
presentation

272
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,360
um

273
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
one of the consequences of actually

274
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
doing as much as possible in code is

275
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
that well it becomes a development

276
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
development project and this also means

277
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
that you have to implement some of the

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,399
principles you would do um when doing

279
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,399
development with my background as a

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
devops engineer i did a lot of these

281
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
things so the things we actually

282
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
implemented is things like test driven

283
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
development deployment pipelines and all

284
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
of these things

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,920
and one of the important things that we

286
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
implemented to structuralize actually

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
over development effort is um we we

288
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
started using uh the scum methodology

289
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
scum is actually an agile development

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,360
methodology which allows you to

291
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,920
structure your development efforts and

292
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
the beginning when we started using xor

293
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,880
we were just two guys um developing

294
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,680
playbooks on a production environment

295
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
and and the requirements weren't clear

296
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
we just okay we had daily calls with uh

297
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,959
with with the salt manager alexander and

298
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,480
we were just implementing stuff and we

299
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
were just going going going um

300
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
when you do this with two people it's

301
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
kind of manageable but now we've grown

302
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
our team into six

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
um solar engineers who would they are

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,720
dedicated um uh just uh right

305
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
automations the entire time well if you

306
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
grow your team you need a better

307
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
methodology yeah with it what's come as

308
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
common actually allows you or

309
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
requires you to first define all of the

310
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
requirements for development as user

311
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
stories and everything needs to be

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
cleared what you need to develop

313
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,839
um

314
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
once that's clear yeah you need to plan

315
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
it and and the nice thing about scrum is

316
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
um you can incrementally improve all of

317
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,680
your processes and at the end of the

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
each

319
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
scum sprint and when it's come you use a

320
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
sprint of two weeks

321
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,079
where you plan all of your development

322
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
tasks at the end of the sprint

323
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
you um you do a retrospective meeting

324
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,399
where you actually reflect on the

325
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,480
previous spin to see okay what went well

326
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,160
what didn't went well and what well then

327
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
better and we've been doing this for

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
almost a year now and you really see

329
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,560
that we have been able to

330
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
produce much more we have been able to

331
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
do a planning because in the beginning

332
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,200
it was impossible for us to um to commit

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
to our customers okay this is when your

334
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
feature request will be delivered that's

335
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
something we can actually do now because

336
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
we have an insight on how how many

337
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
development

338
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
how many development dolls can we

339
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,519
actually do within one spin

340
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
and also when you do development uh

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
some other things actually are also

342
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
really important first of all um would

343
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
put everything into version control i

344
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,959
have to make sure that everybody's

345
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
working on the same code base very

346
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,760
important one um have um

347
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
don't develop on production you would

348
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
think that's logical but that still

349
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,240
happens we have a development testing qa

350
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,600
and and um

351
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
and production server and we use our

352
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,279
version control to move everything

353
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
between those servers uh all of our code

354
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
is on hit up and we use pull requests

355
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
between different branches those pull

356
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
requests need to be reviewed by

357
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
by somebody else who developed it and

358
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
all of those things so

359
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
when you start doing this treat it as a

360
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,880
development project implement the same

361
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
principles as you would as when

362
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
developing software basically

363
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,560
that's a very important one

364
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
so now to the interesting part uh we're

365
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,519
going to show you a demo the scenario of

366
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
the demo is where oh first we're going

367
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
to show you the end user perspective and

368
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
the scenario is the

369
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
ceo opens a malicious document on this

370
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,519
laptop

371
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,680
um and and first we will show you the

372
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
end user perspective to show you how

373
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,720
long does it take for ultimate automated

374
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
mediation actions to be applied and then

375
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
we will show you how this all looks in

376
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
xor

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
and and how how this exactly works

378
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
uh so

379
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
first we'll show you the end user

380
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,959
perspective

381
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,360
and this is the laptop of the ceo um

382
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
we're going to show you exactly how long

383
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,120
it takes so let's start top stopwatch

384
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,800
and execute the the malicious document

385
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
now we have cortex xvr uh installed as

386
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,240
an edr tool and after 39 seconds it has

387
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
already detected that okay something

388
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,160
malicious has happened on the on the

389
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,639
laptop this alert will now be ingested

390
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
into xor

391
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
um and organelles playbooks will

392
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
determine that well the cat is actually

393
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
uh the

394
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,839
malicious document has been allowed to

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,639
run

396
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,600
and it would automatically execute a v

397
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
scan

398
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
so here you can see after two minutes

399
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
after the alert has been generated a

400
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
v-scan has already been executed

401
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
the second immediate remediation action

402
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
that will be executed is a machine

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
isolation this is a semi-automated

404
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
process which requires an approval from

405
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
a senior analyst so

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
depending of course on how long the

407
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
scenic analyst takes to approve it

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
the machine will be isolated so here you

409
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
can see that

410
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,680
after uh well in total

411
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,639
four minutes um one total four minutes

412
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,160
the the the

413
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,680
the threat has been

414
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
detected our humiliation actions have

415
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,560
been taken and the the cat has been

416
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,160
contained

417
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,360
so how does this look like in xor

418
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,000
here you can see the the xor interface

419
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
and this is one of the dashboard this is

420
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
actually the dashboard that the analyst

421
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
looks at every day so if a new incident

422
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
comes in the

423
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
it will show up in this dashboard excel

424
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
pulls alerts every minute so it can take

425
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
up to one minute before the alert is

426
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
actually um in our soft platform

427
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
so let's refresh this dashboard until

428
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,199
the left is there

429
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,880
ah

430
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
there it is

431
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,759
this is the alerts let's look at the

432
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
playbooks that are being executed

433
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
now it's already on the analysis

434
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,399
playbook

435
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,759
okay now it's already on the

436
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,320
notification playbook and because this

437
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
is the laptop of the ceo which is

438
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
defined as a critical asset a different

439
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
escalation part is actually followed so

440
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
our analyst will get a phone call

441
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,519
because this is a category

442
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
security alert from the yeti security

443
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,279
operations center this is a severity

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,519
alert for wildfire malware laptop ceo

445
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,199
press one at any time to acknowledge

446
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
this alert to hear more details please

447
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
press two thank you for acknowledging

448
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,639
this

449
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,480
so that's actually the goal that a

450
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
senior conclusion analyst will get uh

451
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
because this is a critical uh severity

452
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,199
alert uh and this is a gold chain that's

453
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,800
well if somebody doesn't acknowledge it

454
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,120
it will go to the next person so and now

455
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
we can already see all of the

456
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,040
remediation actions actually have been

457
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
executed

458
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,199
um

459
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,160
and um well we'll see how this looks

460
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
like um well maybe first of all i'll

461
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
show you the interface itself this is

462
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,920
the interface of pixel what you can see

463
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
here is on the left you can see all the

464
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
case details the severity okay it is a

465
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
chemical asset it's not aggregated the

466
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
incident is the outcome is allowed which

467
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,000
means that the cat has not been blocked

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
here you can see the the investigation

469
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,480
data so what the result of the analysis

470
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
playbooks were so here it says the

471
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
threads were detected but

472
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
they were not all contained here on the

473
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,560
here you can see all of the indicators

474
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
which are actually in the alert

475
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
in the incident so all the hashes the

476
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
sample uh which user account which hosts

477
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
all of these things here you can see the

478
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,520
actual um malicious document that got

479
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,799
executed

480
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,839
and um we also try or we ingest alerts

481
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,000
from different themes and we present a

482
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
unified interface and just one layout to

483
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,880
the analyst depend or

484
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,839
that doesn't

485
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,679
doesn't matter which

486
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,280
source product actually the alerts

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
generated

488
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
so in the remediation tab here you can

489
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
see all of the

490
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
available remediation actions here is a

491
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
list of the ones that have actually been

492
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
executed so here you can see okay a scan

493
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
is spending and isolation that's pending

494
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
approval so um this actually requires

495
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
approval from a senior handlers

496
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
so what they need to do is

497
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,799
first click the load button to see the

498
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,320
approvals

499
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,679
then they have to approve it

500
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
and then submit the approval here you

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
can see okay the status approval status

502
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,799
is approved and now it's waiting to be

503
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,640
executed and this actually runs on the

504
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
job on the background

505
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
so that okay here you can already see

506
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
that the machine has been isolated

507
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
so this is actually how this looks like

508
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160

exo

510
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
allows you to completely customize the

511
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,039
interface which is really nice this is a

512
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
completely custom tab that we created

513
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
ourselves and with the automations on

514
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
the background you can actually run all

515
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,039
of the python code you want so it's a

516
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
very flexible platform and this has

517
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
allowed us to actually

518
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,480
automate

519
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,039
