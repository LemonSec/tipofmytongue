1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,759
hi everyone pleasure to connect to all

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
of you today my name is founder and ceo

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
of chicago blink so in today's session

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,639
we are going to talk about the future of

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
application security and what are the

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,760
key challenges which are placed by the

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,279
organizations

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,560
so let's start with uh the agenda so we

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
will be covering up the topics which are

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
related to what is application security

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,359
why the application security is

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
important the type of application

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,439
security the common application security

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
flaws and what are the application

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
security tools which has been used by an

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,040
organization

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
and what are the key challenges which

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
are still in organizations are facing in

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
terms of application security

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
the best approach the application like

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
us for the applications currently the

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
current and the future one

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
so let's first start with the what is

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
application security so application

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
security is a process of developing

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320
adding and testing the security features

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
within the application to minimize the

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,440
security vulnerabilities so it is just

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
like that we are adding the multiple

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
layers to an application so that we can

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
make it

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
uh proof like we can make it like cloud

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
from all the external attacks and

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,119
whenever like a hacker will going to try

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
to penetrate those application they need

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
to pass through the multiple security

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
layers so this is how we are improving

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
uh the overall security of an

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,080
application and this process is known as

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
an application security

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
so where we are like identifying the

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
early stage of vulnerabilities and then

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
we are reducing and we are eliminating

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
those vulnerabilities with our

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799
approaches and with that different kind

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
of like uh the products and the tools

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
that we're going to use

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,880
so what happens in security is important

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
so uh let's start with uh some couple of

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,079
sets that we have captured mainly from

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,320
the flex data micro focus and dividend

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,399
security which says that

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
60.5 of the applications vulnerabilities

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,840
are remotely exploitable 42 percent

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
organizations experience an external

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
attack due to an application security

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
clause 79 of the organizations push the

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
vulnerable code to the production either

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
regularly or occasionally so this is

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
like mainly taken care by other

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
organizations which are like early stage

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
or which are like in the medium stage

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
because those in those organizations

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
they don't have any security means that

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
maximum of the development deployment

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
work is taken care by only the

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
developers

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
and if they by mistake push the any kind

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
of vulnerabilities which are associated

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
and that is their code

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
if they put it in the production

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,519
environment automatically it is making

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
them more vulnerable of getting a cyber

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
attack then 42 percent of the

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
vulnerabilities in the applications are

76
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
indexed in others because even in

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
today's times a lot of enterprises

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
applications and small medium business

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,239
applications are using the previous tax

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,239
so they are more prone of getting uh the

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
sql injection attacks then 83 percent of

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,319
the applications are still formed to

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
remain vulnerable after the initial scan

84
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,319
simply like if we start with the initial

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
kind of a scale because scanning is just

86
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,080
not the one process

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,239
it just sounds like a very basic process

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
which uh the company and

89
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,440
organizations have an attack and fifty

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
percent of the apps on an average like

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,280
they found vulnerable because they they

92
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
didn't have adopted uh their stack of

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,000
approaches

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
so this is a trend like a graph that we

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
have created from 2009 to 2020 and uh

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
which says that uh shows the rapid

97
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
increase in the vulnerability longer

98
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
vulnerability

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
and if you can see like from 2019 2020

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
there is a drastic change that we have

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,239
got because in today's time the

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
organizations are

103
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
including a lot of third-party libraries

104
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
in order to make their applications more

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
robust and to provide the best user

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
experience to their customers and in

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
order to do that they are basically

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
following up uh with a lot of

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,599
third-party libraries and which is

110
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,040
automatically making them more and more

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
vulnerable of getting a cyber attack

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
so the top security flaws that uh we

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,640
have captured which has been uh covered

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
by uh reported by the vera code and uh c

115
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
cw imagery so victory is a framework

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,920
which is like followed by all the

117
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
enterprises

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
and it says that in the common clause if

119
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
we talk about these are the popular

120
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,759
common flaws which uh have been found in

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
the application it starts with the

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
information leakage which is coming up

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
like at 64 percent and the

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
cryptographical abnormalities which is

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,240
like 62 percent then cllf injections the

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
core qualities insufficient input

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
validation cross side scripting attack

128
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
directory trans transversal then

129
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
credential management and if we go for

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,080
the top 10 like the top 10 uh cve which

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
is being given by the big tree for this

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
year for 2021 which starts with the

133
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
outer bound right which has the thread

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
score of like 65.93

135
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,800
then cross side scripting which is like

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
46.84

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
then out of boundary which is 24.9 then

138
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,080
the improper input validation that is

139
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,919
20.47 then os command injection that is

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,759
19.55 let's go injection 19.54 then use

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,400
after free part

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
transposer then the cross side scripting

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
uh

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
probably and unrestricted of your

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
profile in a dangerous type so all of

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
these detail like if you wanted to know

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
what these terms mean so this is like

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
widely available over the cb inventory

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,639
websites and you can just go there and

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,720
you can just search about these terms to

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
get a more detail about it because here

152
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
we can't like cover all her

153
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,919
uh

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,000
topics at once so i'm just giving an

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,160
outline of like the toxic applications

156
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,919
about these laws which has been followed

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,639
by

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,039
uh the

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
then moving to the next we are talking

160
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,280
about the type of application security

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
so the application security is mainly

162
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
divided up into the five types which

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
starts with the critical infrastructure

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,199
and security where we are talking about

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,919
the

166
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,520
applications which has been used in the

167
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
critical infrastructure mainly with the

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,880
power grid

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
with the electricity uh segments and

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
with uh the nuclear reactors so all of

171
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,639
these critical applications they are

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,919
again like the cyber security is

173
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
required in that because they are

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
handling those critical infrastructure

175
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
then moving to the next then we have the

176
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
mobile application securities which is

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
related to all the mobile applications

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
that have applications that have been

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,039
used

180
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,120
the network securities again the network

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
security display is a very important

182
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,039
role because this is the first

183
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
contact the first enter entry point for

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,560
a hacker and if we get anyhow the clean

185
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,960
source of the traffic network which is

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
they can definitely enter into their

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
database

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
then the cloud securities are there

189
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
which uh which has been like introduced

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
by maximum of the applications are

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
getting deployed over the cloud so they

192
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
need to follow the various kind of

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
approaches to adopt those securities

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
then the iot security is there for all

195
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
the iot devices

196
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,280
so what are the application security

197
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
challenges uh which the companies are

198
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,199
facing in today's time starts with the

199
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
inherited vulnerabilities like some of

200
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
the code that they are using and using

201
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
it so the vulnerabilities are getting

202
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
edited from the previous groups okay but

203
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,039
from some like uh the third-party

204
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,400
libraries

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
which are again making them more and

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
more vulnerable of getting a fabulous

207
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
text and the second we have the third

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
party and open source vulnerabilities

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,639
and backboards and software supply chain

210
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,560
attacks which have been recently

211
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
experienced by

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
uh a lot of big organizations may be

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
based out of us like if you talk about

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
the colonial pipeline if we talk about

215
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,919
the other hacks which has been taken

216
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,160
place in the least seven months so they

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
are all like affected by the software

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
supply chain only which is one of the

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
highest challenge for an organization

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
then the volatility directions are there

221
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
because still the organization doesn't

222
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
have the robust solution in order to

223
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
protect the vulnerability in the runtime

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
environment and the epa security is that

225
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,960
against is a very important role because

226
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,520
different organizations have some uh

227
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
endpoints which are publicly available

228
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,840
and if they don't uh like

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,080
deploy any sort of securities and

230
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,479
points then automatically like the hiker

231
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
can easily access those customer data

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,599
sets

233
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
so what are the application security

234
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
tools so these are the popular tools

235
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,840
which is which has been used by an

236
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,720
organization security testing and

237
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
dynamic application security testing and

238
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,319
interactive wrapping specifically these

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
three approaches are mainly followed by

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,639
all the kind testers our security and

241
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,080
others and they start with the

242
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
application testing but while following

243
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
these three approaches

244
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
so then we have like the software

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
composition analysis this is something a

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
bit new because uh here we are analyzing

247
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
the all the components of that soft of

248
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
that software and we are lifting up and

249
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
finding out the vulnerabilities which

250
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,679
are associated to a very core level of

251
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
an application then the new approach

252
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,159
like a lot of tools have been offered by

253
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
an organizers which are basically

254
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,760
providing up the application testing as

255
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,839
a service

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,720
so the application security trends uh

257
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,279
so basically the rays that we have seen

258
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
post over like uh in the new normal the

259
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
organizations are now moving

260
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
towards the cloud like they are not at

261
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,000
all going forward with the on-premises

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
servers which has been followed by the

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,480
previous approaches uh and the post

264
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
pandemic uh time now the people like uh

265
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,200
they have adopted a hybrid model or

266
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
working from home so definitely they

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
need to move their applications to the

268
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
cloud so the rapid movement of an

269
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,399
application and the rapid cloud adoption

270
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
of an uh of an organization

271
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,000
automatically like uh it's at the scale

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,839
which is which we have seen in the past

273
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
couple of months

274
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
then the runtime application self

275
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
protection this is also again being

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
followed by

277
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,680
the terms of trains in the application

278
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
security

279
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
then we have the runtime uh application

280
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
self protection rasp this is one of the

281
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,480
most popular approach which has been

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,440
followed by the recency so cios and the

283
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
security analyst then the back end as a

284
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
services where we are like companies are

285
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
following a very robust approach in

286
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
today's time where they are giving out

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,720
they are created a back end as a service

288
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
so they are deploying the microservices

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
there and they are utilizing uh those

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
services in the secured environment

291
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,519
which is much more secure practice

292
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
comparatively to the traditional

293
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,160
approach

294
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
of deploying a monolithic architecture

295
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
then we have the monitoring tools which

296
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
are available mainly for the public and

297
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
private clouds every cloud companies

298
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,720
have those monitoring tools available if

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
it goes from aws from sap from microsoft

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
affair everyone have the monitoring

301
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
tools available and even like a lot of

302
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
other third party companies are also

303
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
offering which we can directly connect

304
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,959
with those cloud providers and we can

305
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,040
monitor all the traffic then bound and

306
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
outbound traffic of an application then

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
the web application firewalls they are

308
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,279
basically the previous approach

309
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
which is mainly like uh followed by an

310
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
organization they just deploy the

311
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
firewalls and

312
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
then the function as a service is again

313
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
it's a serverless model which has been

314
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
followed by an organizers and

315
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
application of operator protection this

316
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
is pretty much new

317
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
uh because in today's time even what the

318
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
hackers are doing they are basically

319
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
like uh

320
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
using uh the memory that they are

321
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
creating like deploying the memory based

322
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,120
kind of attacks which are very difficult

323
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
to

324
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
figure out or to

325
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,079
detect by the traditional application

326
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,399
security scanners and

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
this thing we can like easily uh

328
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
detect if yeah if an organization is

329
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
using any sort of tool which is based

330
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
out of like workload protection

331
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
so then uh in the last we will be

332
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,240
talking about all the

333
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
approaches the current approaches and

334
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
the future approaches which is being

335
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
taken by

336
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,120
organizations for the application

337
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
security

338
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
so the current approach if we talk about

339
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
is like they are adopting the advanced

340
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,600
uh application security frameworks they

341
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,880
are creating uh the code the secure code

342
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
they are monitoring the complete code

343
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
and they are thinking like whether it is

344
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
like not coming up from any sort of from

345
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
the third party uh popular forums then

346
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
implementing the security as a design

347
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,279
this is like one of the most

348
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,639
recommended approach which uh even i do

349
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,560
recommend for mind and which the

350
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
organization need to follow whenever

351
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
they are designing or developing any any

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
kind of a product they need to implement

353
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,639
the security as a design

354
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,079
so that at every stage it should

355
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,639
uh get into those security layers and

356
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,600
which automatically will make the hacker

357
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,760
works pretty much harder

358
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
then integrating a security into the

359
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,120
development the software development

360
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
stages where we are like deploying

361
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
testing the cipd pipeline that we are

362
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
talking about so we are integrating the

363
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
security in that part also

364
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,399
then

365
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,120
using the latest lab technology so it is

366
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
basically like uh

367
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
organizations need to adopt all the

368
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,920
latest technologies which

369
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
for developing up their application

370
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
whether it is mobile iot or auburn

371
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
applications try avoiding the previous

372
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,160
uh

373
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,240
techniques or the previous technologies

374
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
which are not getting any frequent

375
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,519
updates because those frameworks and

376
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,120
approaches are more

377
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
getting more vulnerable of getting a

378
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,279
sample attack then regularly they need

379
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
to update their softwares with the

380
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,839
recent patches and the recent uh updates

381
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
that have been ruled out by an

382
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
they contain a organization important

383
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,440
security critical threat critical like

384
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
uh updates

385
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
then the future approaches uh so arrange

386
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
and prioritize the application this is

387
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,120
this is going to come up in the future

388
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,800
approach where we are prioritizing that

389
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
which application and

390
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
is more important in an organization

391
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,959
which is handling the more critical data

392
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
then data should be encrypted we need to

393
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
verify all the third party libraries

394
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,600
that has been used in an application

395
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,639
then we need to use some more advanced

396
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,399
artificial intelligence-based tools in

397
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
order to find the zero-day

398
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
vulnerabilities because this kind of

399
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
vulnerabilities are like

400
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,639
maximum of organizations are getting

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
affected of these vulnerabilities

402
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
and it's like give them a very less time

403
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,959
to

404
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,000
just revert or to take any kind of

405
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
action against it and report to that

406
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
only like the hackers do their work and

407
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,079
they just

408
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
take their complete that data or whether

409
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,600
they just

410
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,839
start with the ransomware kind of attack

411
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
or after doing their encryptions and

412
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
securing all the public dps that have

413
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
been used in that applications and using

414
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
the automated remediations approach

415
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
which are automatically making an

416
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,279
applications uh

417
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,880
more uh

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
better in terms of samurai than the

419
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,199
application security testing and

420
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
orchestration this is like one of the uh

421
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
newest approach which the organizations

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
they seems like they will be definitely

423
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
adopting it in the coming features so

424
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
these are the some couple of ways uh the

425
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
previous ways and the new ways which

426
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,000
organizations are following and either

427
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
like definitely you can uh somehow you

428
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
can like make your applications

429
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
less prone of getting a

430
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
cyberattack

431
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
so that's all from my side and if you

432
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,720
have any questions you can connect us

433
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,880
connect me me over the linkedin or the

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
twitter uh my username is appaintredu

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
and i will be happy to take any further

436
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,079
questions

437
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
thank you and thank you
