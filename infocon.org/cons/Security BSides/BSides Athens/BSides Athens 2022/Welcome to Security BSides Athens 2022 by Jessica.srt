00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
hi all welcome to besides athens 2022

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,880
i'm jessica russo speaking from london

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
we are glad to have received your

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,039
continued support and participation

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
through the years bringing us to today

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
the seventh besides athens

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,599
this year we have been extremely busy

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,320
regaining control of our lives back from

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,239
coronavirus

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
till the last moment we were not quite

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,200
sure whether we would manage to host an

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
in-person event

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
hence we decided to stream it on youtube

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,520
similarly to last year in order to save

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
up some energy for next year's event and

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
maybe a couple of aces in the whole

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
we cannot thank enough our sponsors who

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,239
reached out to us this year offering

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,760
their support

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
just for this year we decided to not

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
accept any sponsorships as this event is

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,400
going to be virtual and our costs are

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
significantly lower

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
however we have missed you a lot and we

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
are committed to making next year's

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,280
event a great in-person gathering

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
should you wish to sponsor us or support

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,880
us in other ways please don't hesitate

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,960

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,240

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
