1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,240
hi guys this is rg and today we're going

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,559
to talk about vulnerability

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
i'll start with a few words about myself

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,440
i'm the business development director

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,359
and chief information security officer

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,400
for

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
a major greek integrator and managed

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,359
service provider

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,080
and i'm the membership chair of the

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
helen chapter of ice square

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
i'm also a published poet and a retired

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
handheld comedy tractor

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
now the agenda which uh i'll try to

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,440
follow

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
um is going to include the significance

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,920
of liability management a few words

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
about human firewall which is

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
excessively important

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,239
and

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,680
a small episode of

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
work-life balance story or better life

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
work balance as it ought to be

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,920
now starting from the vulnerability

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,960
in them

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,879
in a more generic way you only abilities

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
the quality or state of being

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,399
exposed to the possibility of being

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,559
attacked or harmed

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,080
either physically or emotionally you

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
should stick to the emotional part

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
when we're talking about a system it's a

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,560
any floor weakness in

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
the system's core procedure control

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
design or implementation

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
that

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,479
can be exploited

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,560
so the security posture the security

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
policy of its system

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
can be validated

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
when we're talking about systems of

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
course i'm referring to any server

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
workstation

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
network device i have a camera ip

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
telephony

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
thing or anything that has an ip and can

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,119
be reached by a potential intruder

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
now i'll start off something

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
pretty common i'm

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
i'm talking to a to a besides crowd in

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,439
any case the i can see the intrusion

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
kill chain

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
you know i interact with a lot of

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
customers and

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,079
i

55
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
when i'm talking to d or c level

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
executives

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
i i give them a glimpse of it

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
stating that

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
you see that vulnerability the world

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
vulnerability and it's like vulnerable

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,560
here

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
it's referred in the step four the

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
exploitation part

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
but

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
if we do something about it the the

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
absolute truth is that

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
we're going to impact

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
the very step one the reconnaissance so

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
you see here it says research identify

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
and select of targets what i'm stressing

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
is that

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
having a controlled vulnerability

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
posturing keeping your vulnerabilities

74
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
vulnerability simple words

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
as low as possible in significance and

76
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,519
in numbers

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,959
uh

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,319
will prevent

79
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
like um

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
an attacker which is a random or a

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,440
semi-random attack

82
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
to harm you so

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,239
the aggressor will find a

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,519
a weaker

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
potential victim it's the same as

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,319
bullying

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,519
but even if something is really targeted

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
again we're gonna make um the life and

89
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,840
uh

90
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
uh the effort of the aggression very

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
very difficult by having uh

92
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
at a you know

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,319
a nice and neat uh public footprint

94
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
so

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
uh

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
moving from the iksc we see that this

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
effort to have everything in control

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
is actually a life cycle i mean

99
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,319
that's no news that everything in ict

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,319
and cyber security is not a straight

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
line from a to z it's not what i one

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
time think about it's a recurring part

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,000
so

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
we really need i mean in simple words

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
here we're seeing six notes but in

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
simple words we need to assess report

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,200
and do something to remediate to fix

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
either permanently or not

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,319
the

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,080
vulnerabilities that

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,439
that we have

112
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
we say remediate but i mean compensate

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
as well so maybe there is a zero day

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599
that is out in the wild for a few hours

115
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
there is no patch from the vendors yet

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
but still maybe we can harden our ips

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
policy or put an extra access

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
listener modifier wall or maybe

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,519
apologies for that

120
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,399
put a web application firewall as well

121
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,479
anything that

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,199
one can do to to mitigate

123
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,520
to mitigate an issue

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
and again

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
this is a process-based action like uh

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
we need to verify this cover and again

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
run the drill from from start

128
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
so

129
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
the the main thing is that we need to do

130
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,440
it consistently key here is to fix

131
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
the important

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
part

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
consistently

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
when talking about consistency of course

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
there is a maturity model and then

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,680
many of you should already know the cmm

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
so this is a cmm approach to the

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
vulnerability management

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,560
uh i won't spend much of the time here

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,039
so we really need to be proactive the

141
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,560
you know the photograph is not optimal

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
but the key here is proactive so we'll

143
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
start from step three as a baseline

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
we need to have something really defined

145
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,880
and then

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
it needs to get you know as optimized as

147
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
possible now

148
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,479
step four

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
the optimization is again another

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
life cycle approach so there are levels

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,880
of optimization and so on as as you see

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
as the aggressor

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
they are and they they become more and

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,919
more agile and more dynamic the same

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
needs to happen to your to your

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
vulnerability management strategy

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
and of course

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,199
code

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
cannot be excluded i mean i have uh i

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
have a few customers running software

161
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
development companies and they say rg i

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,199
mean we have outsourced everything to

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
our cloud providers

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,400
to azure or aws or google and or maybe

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
we have a

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
a few of them around like the inter

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
cloud approach so

168
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,319
the

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
the provider takes care of everything

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
because we're we're buying we're

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
utilizing and buying a

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
platform as a service

173
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,240
but

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
in a vast majority unfortunately they're

175
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,759
not incorporating security controls in

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,479
their

177
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
sdlc so they end up identifying a few

178
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
issues

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
even even if not uh following the

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,240
waterfall

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
model and their agile they state that

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,520
they're agile

183
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
they run some tests at the end

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
so they end up accepting

185
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
uh an enormous residual risk or

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,280
spending a lot of money and effort and

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,639
money again

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
to to fix some things before they go

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,520
live so

190
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
[Music]

191
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,000
for me wasp is out there for 15 or more

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
years there is the asvaes

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
version 4 now it's the application

194
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
security verification standard

195
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,000
we should all target for level 2 as a

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
baseline

197
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
and

198
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,840
you know guys if your if your

199
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
application

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
uses

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
critical data like

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
financial data or personal information

203
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
or sensitive information

204
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
you should really target for level three

205
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
even if it's not easy to fulfill the 286

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
controls

207
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
at the moment

208
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,919
i've seen out there a lot of

209
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
very nice apps i mean people spend

210
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
enormous money

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
in the ux and ui and for marketing

212
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,319
purposes oh my god i'm in

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
to converge customers and then they get

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
hacked by uh

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
by somebody because the application is

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
not uh is

217
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,280
is poor

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
it's fully written security-wise and

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
that's the same

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,039
now

221
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,840
um this is a human firewall it's a big

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
commodity it's sorry it's a big buzzword

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,800
out there you know it's something that

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
uh as a term started a couple of years

225
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,599
ago but it's it's true it's fundamental

226
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,280
you can spend

227
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
crazy money on next generation and next

228
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,400
next generation things and then you have

229
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
your user

230
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
plugging in a usb device or click on a

231
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
link and that's it

232
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
you're pretty much [ __ ] apologies for

233
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
the for the language but

234
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,679
it is highly essential to

235
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
train your users and as i

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,320
stress and i don't stress enough

237
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
sometimes

238
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,479
and your security team i mean okay

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
they're i.t guys or infosec guys and

240
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,279
they

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
they know how to

242
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
uh

243
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,560
hopefully they know how to

244
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
to to check if a any mail is uh is a

245
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
fraud or not or

246
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,880
they don't use a

247
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
their personal usb stick at the office

248
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
but

249
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,480
you need to have an easy response plan i

250
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
mean even if you're not

251
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,920
abiding a framework like iso 27001 nist

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,240
bimco or imo for shipping

253
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
you need to have some processes around

254
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
and you need to check them

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
with along with

256
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
the other stakeholders uh a few times

257
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,360
per year and then

258
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
when something happens because

259
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,320
inevitably

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
inevitably something will happen

261
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
that's good that it wouldn't be

262
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,839
something

263
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
serious

264
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
they need to reach out to the management

265
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,839
to

266
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
to marketing to legal

267
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
and engage all the stakeholders so

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
everyone involved needs to be

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,040
trained

270
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
now uh this is a photograph

271
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
we're gonna be staying in the in the

272
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
human asset part

273
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,240
uh this is a photograph that i uh i

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,040
chose uh the last minute to include

275
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
it's nice because it starts from the

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,680
comfort zone

277
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
as something that we were in the past

278
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
and and that's true

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
and um it refers to the stretch zone you

280
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
know uh i i usually wake up quite early

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
for uh multiple reasons and

282
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,279
i used to

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,399
uh to listen to all this uh motivational

284
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
speaking and how to become a the best

285
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
entrepreneur the best uh

286
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,399
executive

287
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
and they often refer to the straight

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
zone you need to fight and fight and

289
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
fight and

290
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,399
become better and that's true but uh

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,760
there are limits to it and nobody really

292
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
refers to the panic zone which is what

293
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
comes

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,959
if you if you haven't sent your

295
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,440
boundaries so the ultimate truth is that

296
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
human assets and i'm referring to actual

297
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
people they can also be vulnerable and

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,320
aspect to breaches

299
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
which means that

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,760
no matter how they look outside i mean

301
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,160
they can be very functional they can

302
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
laugh they kind of work with you they

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
they can eat it's okay

304
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
they can go out with for a beer with you

305
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
or

306
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
you know and you think that they have a

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
a perfect life

308
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,079
they can still be vulnerable and they

309
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
can uh they can feel bad and

310
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
when i'm saying they feel bad i'm

311
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,640
talking about anxiety this is

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,770
a mysterious anxiety

313
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,040
[Music]

314
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
they can be stressed they can feel like

315
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
shite

316
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
and that's a very important thing

317
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
because uh then your next generation of

318
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,079
firewall looks something like this

319
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,199
this is your edr

320
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
and

321
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
this is your web application firewall

322
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
all your

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
dlp so

324
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
but these are just tools just

325
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
instruments

326
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
they are

327
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
compensative measures

328
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,519
but they don't really really remediate

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
the problem so

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,079
there are things that

331
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
we should do

332
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,399
this is a picture of myself a few years

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
ago

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
unfortunately this is something that i'm

335
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
sure that it looks familiar to uh

336
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
to a lot of you when you look yourself

337
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
in the mirror every every morning and it

338
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
doesn't matter you don't have to be an

339
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
executive

340
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,639
to feel like that or to be like that

341
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
but uh

342
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,800
yeah there is uh

343
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
there

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
there are ways to

345
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,600
to turn this around so

346
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
we're gonna talk about your remediation

347
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
plan here

348
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,920
we need to to learn to say no and

349
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,839
believe me it does have to do with poor

350
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,160
management time management skills there

351
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,120
are people

352
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
there are people

353
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
there are things that and people that we

354
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
need to

355
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
to say no to so

356
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
that's uh that's important again

357
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,079
establish boundaries it might

358
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,519
you know it might look the same but it's

359
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,560
not

360
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,279
uh there are some lines

361
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,160
that

362
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,639
we should never cross regarding our uh

363
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
our well-being or you know the the life

364
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
work balance as i said in the start

365
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
so yeah maybe don't work um

366
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
16 hours 16 hours

367
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,320
every day for

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
for many many years just to you know to

369
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
buy a brand new car or something

370
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,399
uh

371
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,040
it does worth it

372
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,120
we should ask for help and i mean

373
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,959
professional help yeah you can talk to

374
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:31,760
your

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
to your parents or to your better half

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
or to a friend of yours and that's fine

377
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,320
but professionals are out there it's um

378
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
the same reason people hire us to to do

379
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
a professional presentation test or

380
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
vulnerability assessment or something

381
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
and they don't reach out to uh

382
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
for a freebie out there

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
and uh very important

384
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
uh try to build a positive relationship

385
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,839
with your boss

386
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,480
