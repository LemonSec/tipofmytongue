1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,400
hello hi there i'm constantina cuckoo

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,559
i'm a cyber security expert and i'm

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
currently working in checkpoint software

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,840
technologies

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
today in besides athens 2022

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
i want to discuss with you about

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,960
something that for me it's very

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
interesting it's been around for quite

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
some time i think that you already heard

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
of it's about zero trust model

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,279
it's a new term everybody is talking

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,719
about it and maybe has a project on it

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
so i would like to navigate on it uh

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,120
together

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,920
so

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
uh before actually start start talking

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,360
about zero trust model i would like to

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
generally start talking about a little

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
about trust and

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
as a human factor and something that you

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
could trust as a human

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,160
uh personally for me i had i have zero

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
trust in airport sushi i don't know if

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
you have ever tried that it's terrible

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
i would never use a

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,720
used mattress in my own place

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
i don't believe in competition scam of

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
course as a security

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
person and also i don't have trust in

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
everything that has ip and it's

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,439
communicating

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,640
so if traditional access we would say

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,600
it's about the principle of trust but

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
verify zero trust is rooted around

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
the principle

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
never trust and always verify

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,320
and on the network level this is a nice

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
picture of

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,720
what

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
zero thrust

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
would be

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,720
next i would uh

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,880
i would like to state that zero trust

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,280
security is not a product of course as

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
you may know it's a process there are

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
many best practices there are principles

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
that organizations should observe on the

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,799
path to zero trust security and to

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,360
better understand that i would drop an

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
analogy with our physical world in the

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
real world and uh it's not other than uh

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,079
the airport i think you you

53
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,200
you visited

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
quite some times

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,399
and in doing so i think that we

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,480
participate in many zero trust

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
experiences and all the the security

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,920
processes airport security processes are

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
uh consisting a great example of zero

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
trust implementation strategy

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,319
so to begin with i will start with the

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,120
basics we are always verifying the

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
person that requests access in the

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
airport the context of the request in a

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
more generic idea

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
perspective the risk that this request

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,959
may have and then we are granting access

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,480
required we require nowadays more than

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
one piece of identification and evidence

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
to authenticate the user and in the case

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
of the airport we use the passport in

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
order to say who

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
to state

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
who we say we are and we are boarding

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
also we are using the boarding pass to

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
board the right place going to the

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,519
correct destination in many places

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
actually now they are starting using

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,920
gold to some kind of biometrics for a

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
second factor of authentication and

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
generally authentication could be any

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,080
combination of of course as you know

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
something you know like a password

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
something you have like a verification

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,120
sms and something that you are like a

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
biometric uh users

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
and another principle i think it's very

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
important it's that as we said you will

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
you would never automatically trust

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
anything and in our example this means

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
that we are passing the gate we have

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
zoned uh we have uh

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,799
uh

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,120
yes showcased our boarding pass but

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
still you're not quite there you still

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
have so your luggage and this is because

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,680
even when uh there is nothing wrong with

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
passenger with you of course we have

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,239
identified you but there is a strict

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,400
protocol in the airport that yes we have

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
to check what um you may cover in this

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
luggage that you don't even know that

103
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,680
people are doing mistakes uh they

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
sometimes carry the

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
dangerous uh things on the handles

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
without knowing that and the same is uh

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,040
we would say with the

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
employees in our organization

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,358
uh there's someone that is really

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,600
trusted he has passed the door in the

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
morning scan his card came in the office

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
but he's also carrying his laptop we

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,759
know who he said who he says he is he is

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
also his own

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
but on the other hand we don't know what

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
this device may bring into the

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,479
organization it could be the mobile the

118
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,280
laptop whatever and uh easily it could

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,160
be carrying uh malware on it uh with the

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,040
danger of infecting the whole network

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
so principle number three uh for the

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,360
zero trust is that uh you have to

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,400
monitor and audit everything you can

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,800
protect what you can see that it is

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
known so you have to monitor

126
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
every activity something that uh

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
usually is checked by security officers

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
to quickly

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
understand and react on something that

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
seems suspicious and

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,039
this should be of course real time and

132
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
visibility is especially important for

133
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
users who have

134
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,199
administrative rights due to their

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
serious scope of their access permission

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
the sensitivity of the data that they

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,039
can reach

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,320
uh so we need to say also that uh

139
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
by doing so and by building

140
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,120
uh in a security

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
architecture around these principles

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
what it should uh definitely succeed in

143
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
is that it should have zero false

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
positives law false positives zero false

145
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
negatives and it should be usually

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
seamless for uh the user i mean

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
everything we described so far in the

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
airport uh example

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
it was generally speaking quite

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,080
intuitive for the user it required

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,319
almost a little experience and awareness

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
of the process and it is very important

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
we always say that that uh for cyber

154
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,560
security to be to be consumed it also

155
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
has to be well understood that uh easily

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
for the user is it for the user and um

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,080
on the other hand uh of course it should

158
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,639
be simple but it should be preventive

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
mean meaning that we should also take uh

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,520
always take the right decision when

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,639
there is a suspicious uh incident and it

162
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,400
should be blocked

163
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
and

164
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
it should be efficient meaning both for

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
the users as we said but also for the

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
administrators of the infrastructure and

167
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
it should be complete

168
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
it should they implement all the

169
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
principles of zero trust model

170
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
uh it should increase operational

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
security efficiency overall and uh of

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
course it should be uh protective for uh

173
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
for the organization against cyber

174
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
attacks with real-time threat prevention

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
so we're talking about zero trust people

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
uh zero trust people's zero trans

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
passengers in our example zero trust

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
devices luggages syrian trust workloads

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
in this case could be ai belgian zero

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
thrust networks and zero thrust data

181
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
we're going to go

182
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
into that a little

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,400
fast

184
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
so what we have to do in needs

185
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
of this pillar so for zero trust

186
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,639
architecture

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,240
when we are talking about zero trust

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,039
network of course we have to identify

189
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,840
data and assets that are valuable for

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,720
the organization we should classify the

191
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
level of sensitivity for its asset we

192
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
should map all data flows that are

193
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
happening happening in our organization

194
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
east west north south everything and

195
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
northbound and we should also group uh

196
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,400
assets

197
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
with similar functionalities and

198
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
sensitivity levels into this uh the same

199
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
microsegment for example all the

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
resources that the r d is using the

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,680
source code and the ticket management

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
system it would be nice to be in the

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
same microsegment

204
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
and another thing it uh it would be nice

205
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
to deploy a segmentation gateway whether

206
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
it's physical or virtual in the network

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,879
and

208
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,919
last but not least we should also define

209
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,280
a least privileged access policy to each

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,639
of these assets

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,919
for example

212
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,440
uh the rnd group should access only

213
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,839
their own team's source code not the

214
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,000
next uh

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,799
the colleagues that although he's also

216
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,600
an engineer he belongs to another group

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
so everyone should access the the things

218
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,880
that he's enlisted too

219
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
so zero trust people uh we're talking

220
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
about people a lot and they're involved

221
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
in cyber security and uh

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
the thing is that uh we have of course

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,880
to authenticate user identities on the

224
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
network level

225
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,279
and

226
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
not if possible of the application

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,480
meaning that

228
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,160
uh you don't allow authenticating users

229
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
closer to a security gateway on the

230
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
network level that will block hackers uh

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
from getting too close to the system and

232
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,519
dramatically minimize the this way the

233
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,920
attack service of course you should do

234
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
and use sso which simplifies the process

235
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
of authentication

236
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
uh reassuring how identities with

237
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
multi-factor authentication is a must

238
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
and also you should set context aware

239
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
policies

240
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
meaning uh narrowing down the definition

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
of authorized connections by adding

242
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
multiple conditions

243
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
regarding the context of the connection

244
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
for example you may think that this

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
resource should be accessed by this

246
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
partner that connects from greece only

247
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
nine to five and is something that

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
should be implemented on the network

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
firewood and of course uh we are talking

250
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
also a lot about that uh detecting

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
anomalies uh compare connections with

252
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
the baseline that we have and um for

253
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
example identify unsuccessful logins

254
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,279
unusual times and location more and be

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,079
able to act on this event

256
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,959
zero trans devices also

257
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,000
uh

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
when we're talking about that is uh to

259
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,600
take a

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,880
mean a practical approach to minimize

261
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
the attack surface that comes from the

262
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
devices

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
uh

264
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
for all workstations and mobile devices

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
of course no matter no matter if they

266
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,320
are

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
corporate or uh

268
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
also personal it should carry some

269
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
security controls

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
by the corporation in case it touches

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,279
corporate data

272
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,880
so it should have some kind of

273
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
protection against the zero day malware

274
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
around somewhere we should have

275
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
protection against

276
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
zero facing and uh all the stuff that we

277
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
are currently doing at the endpoint and

278
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
of course we should block uh corporate

279
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
uh access to the devices that are

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,640
infected so positive management and the

281
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
condition our conditional access should

282
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
be also a solution of

283
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
zero thrust devices and of course and

284
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
the first thing we are talking about

285
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,200
segmentation it's always a good idea id

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
iot ot whatever you have in the network

287
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
it should be segmented on another useful

288
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
uh on its practical side

289
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
um when we are talking now about zero

290
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,040
trust data we want uh to enforce

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
encryption on the portable media we want

292
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
to provide secure access for the remote

293
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
users

294
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
we want to apply dlp also dlp rules for

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
our users and the classification of the

296
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
data that is being used

297
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
and um a nice tip here

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,079
is that in order to raise the employees

299
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
awareness of the data use policies that

300
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
you have we know that they can be very

301
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
hard to implement in uh

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
in your organization uh you can release

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,160
some

304
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,920
self-remediation dlp policies

305
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
that will allow to notify the user for

306
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
improper data handling that he's making

307
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,079
in real time

308
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,560
and have the option for him to send this

309
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,360
card or review the the issue it's a kind

310
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,279
of training uh

311
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,600
uh of training technique that it's

312
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
accommodated in main solution many build

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,839
the

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,160
solutions and uh actually now

315
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
the other part is about uh zero trust

316
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
workloads and now we are talking about

317
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,839
some application workloads things that

318
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,240
are sitting on the private cloud and

319
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
public cloud

320
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
and here of course you have to identify

321
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
all the cloud assets that need to be

322
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,519
protected every every all at table point

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
that organization has data needs to be

324
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,240
protected with similar protection and

325
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,839
with unified policies and uh we should

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
identify everything that is related to

327
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
the cloud would would have a database

328
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
server that connects to

329
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
uh today

330
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
to the cloud through internet of course

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
it should be also listed and have the

332
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
the correct way of communication

333
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,839
and

334
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
defined internal segmentation based on

335
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
list privilege we

336
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
said that before i think it's very very

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
important

338
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
visibility and analytics and i think

339
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,519
that i'm slowly coming to an end of this

340
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
wrap-up of the zero trust model

341
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,800
visibility and analytics is very is a

342
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
key i think

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,959
in

344
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,480
everywhere

345
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
in order to simplify all these solutions

346
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
are there they are technical solutions

347
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,480
but also we are talking here there is

348
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,199
also

349
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,279
a framework so we are talking about

350
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
processes but overall we should have in

351
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,839
place some

352
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
ways to easily check our effective

353
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
measures to check what we have

354
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,880
implemented

355
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
uh to have our logs and to revisit them

356
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,800
in order to

357
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,639
daily and in real time of course to

358
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,399
understand the anomalies and whenever

359
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,800
you can of course you can leverage the

360
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
credit intelligence services in order to

361
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
have indicators real-time threat

362
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
indicators uh that are aggregated in

363
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
order to share

364
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,839
to have

365
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,199
useful information that they sell among

366
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,720
all your enforcement points

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
and finally i think that

368
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
wrapping it up with zero trust is

369
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,279
something that uh needs to be discussed

370
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
it needs to take the right approach

371
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
see what they control but i think it's

372
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
more about the mindset

373
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,560
about uh how what we can do and all this

374
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
uh

375
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
never trust always verify i think it's

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
very important so it's zero trust is

377
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
here to keep us safe uh the

378
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
implementations big practical and

379
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,399
physical to consume we want to be

380
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,360
effective and better security always

381
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
matters and i think in the future will

382
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
uh be all

383
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,959
an even bigger concern so it's nice that

384
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,120
we act practically

385
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,839
so

386
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
stay safe trust no one i know that this

387
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,240
is uh

388
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
sounding a little strange but this is it

389
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
when we're talking about cyber attacks

390
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
uh i have listed here some useful links

391
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,199
and maybe you can also uh revisit and

392
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
that was it thank you very much enjoy

393
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,160
the conference bye
