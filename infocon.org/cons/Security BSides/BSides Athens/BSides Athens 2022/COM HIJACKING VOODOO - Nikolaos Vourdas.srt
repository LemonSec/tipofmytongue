and we'll explain

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
come more

31

and we'll show

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
a

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
live we'll show an action about the com

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,560
hunter tool

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,159
com what is

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,200
calm okay

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
the full name of

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,079
com

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,680
is a component object model

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
it is a windows built-in software

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
interface

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
com is useful for the communication for

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,240
any applications

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
mc1 application functional to another

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
and supports a large variety of

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
different programming languages in order

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
to avoid any conflict or troubleshooting

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
of communication different applications

50
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,318
in different written in different

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,799
languages

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,520
here is an simple example of using com

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
we have a word document and we want

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,400
to end a worksheet from excel file

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
for this action com

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
works for you behind the scenes

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
and here we have the worksheet in the

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
document

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
okay let's move on

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
com relationship

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,519
okay

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,680
we have an application name and

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
and application b

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
application name may be is the word

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,400
document the application b

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,120
maybe is the excel document for the

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
previous example

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
the application is the com client

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,799
the application b is the com server

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
application a request for an referring

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
object from application b

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,400
and application b

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
returns its functionality

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
any component of application b

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,400
has a unique identifier

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
named class id

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,280
okay each comcom

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
component is the is the defined via

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
class id which is observed randomly

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
globally unique identifier

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
each component exposes functionality via

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
one or more interfaces identified the

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,319
interface ids

84
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
a com class is an implementation of one

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
or more interfaces represented by their

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
class ids or programmatic the

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,319
identifiers

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,439
blog id this is an example of class id

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
in probably in your system

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,400
the machines

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
the local machines come objects are in

92
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,120
high

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
high key local machine reads the

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
software classes path

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
and user's com objects located

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
in hiveki current user

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
registry software classes path probably

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,520
you know that

99
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,240
okay

100
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
the hive

101
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,280
key class route is the merge of a high

102
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
key local machine and have key current

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
user

104
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
registry

105
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,720
but we have something very interesting

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,440
here it will have the same entry in the

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,199
local machine

108
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,560
registry

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,199
and the high uh in the

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
and in the current user registry

111
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,199
the entry of uh current user registry um

112
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
comes first

113
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
of a local machine register

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
more specifically

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,080
if an attacker

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
has an entry in current user

117
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
registry with a malicious dll

118
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,919
this entry

119
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:26,639
will

120
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,560
run first

121
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
of local machine registry entry

122
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,719
okay

123
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
last but not least about com

124
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,199
relationships the local server key

125
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
represent the full path to an executable

126
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,280
implementation

127
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,680
the in proc server 32 key represent the

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,039
full path

129
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,560
to a dynamic

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
link library implementation

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,759
okay

132
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
this is an example of

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
class

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
class id

135
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,199
probably in your system again

136
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,759
this is from microsoft teams

137
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
as you can see in proc server 32

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
key

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
and this is uh

140
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,039
the dll file as we sent as we said in

141
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,880
proc server 32

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
supports only dll files

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
com hunter

144
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
okay

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
com header is a

146
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,039
40.8.net framework application ssr tool

147
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
about com hijacking persistence

148
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
uh author okay

149
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
it's me

150
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
and the code review by dimitri

151
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
chicopulos i will say special i want to

152

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
you are a teacher for me

155
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
thanks for any advice tips about the

156
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
code

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
the format the optimization

158
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
and i want to announce that me and

159
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
dimitris the meters and me

160
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,400
we will

161
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
release more tools in the future

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,560
the current version of com100 is 1.1

163
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
0.5

164
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
and this is uh

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
the ascii art of compander

166
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
probably you will see that

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
this is a

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
wrong version because

169
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
we took the picture

170
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
from the first version

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,000
some useful

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,039
uh some useful things about uh com

173
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
hunter finds out the entry vault class

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,199
id in the victim's machine

175
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,440
finds out valid classic this via task

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
via task scheduler

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,759
finds out if someone already used any of

178
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,199
those valid class ids in order to do com

179
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
com persistent this is a defense feature

180
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
it supports local server server 32 in

181
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
proc server 32 as we said before

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
about the exact

183
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
dll

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
finds out if someone already used any

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,120
valve class id via scheduler

186
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,560
in order to do a comp resistance

187
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
tries to do automatically com hijacking

188
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,240
persistence with general valve class id

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,640
tries to automatically come hijacking

190
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
persistent via task scheduler

191
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
and tries to use trade task key in order

192
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,720
to refer to a different component

193
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,760
okay

194
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
let's see

195
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
how com counter works in action

196
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
here is rc2

197
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
i use a cobalt strike

198
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
okay

199
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,200
we have

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
access on victi's machine

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
we don't care how

202
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
we gain the this axis

203
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,560
okay

204
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,640
okay

205
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
let's try to upgrade

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,440
interactive cell

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
okay

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
uh here we are

209
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,839
first of all we need to upload evil

210
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,680
dll invictus machine

211
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
okay we will use it

212
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
soon

213
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,600
let's execute com hunt

214
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
com hunter on

215
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
memory

216
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
okay let's

217
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
do this

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,640
for the full screen

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,959
here is uh the full menu

220
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
of com hunter as we said before we have

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
two modes search and persist the search

222
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
mode has two method four methods the

223
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
persist mode has three methods

224
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,120
okay let's use com hunter

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
to find

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
a useful class id without

227
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,360
using

228
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,079
any tool from cc tunnel suite like

229
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
procmon

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
okay

231
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
as you can see com hunter found

232
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,399
those class

233
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,920
ids

234
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
furthermore it's very interesting if you

235
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,440
have if you use compounder in a system

236
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
which has pre-installed

237
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,959
some other application like a chrome or

238
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
firefox browser

239
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
com handler will find

240
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,880
them and will try to find any useful

241
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
class id

242
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,560
as you can see

243
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,239
okay back to our example

244
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
okay we'll use

245
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
this class id because it's very

246
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
promising

247
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,439
persist mode

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
general method

249
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
here is our class id

250
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
and

251
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,480
this is

252
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
the arrival

253
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
dll

254
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
okay

255
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
com hunter says that we have

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
persistence

257
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,959
in the victim machines

258
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,560
let's

259
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
restart

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
the machine

261
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,079
okay

262
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,719
we don't need this

263
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,560
okay

264
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,720
when a machine will power on

265
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,279
the user will be

266
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,079
will sign in

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
will gain a new beacon

268
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,839
as you can see we have con persistence

269
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,480
under dll host process

270
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
okay

271
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
let's go from

272
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,920
for from the defense side

273
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,040
suppose you are a com a threat hunter

274
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,519
okay and you want to use

275
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,320
com hunter

276
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,800
you can see that the com hunter found

277
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,519
that

278
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,920
someone used this

279
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
have have used this

280
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
class id

281
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
and someone

282
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
has

283
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
persistence

284
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
on your system

285
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,920
okay let's go here

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
okay

287
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,959
and now

288
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
we'll use it again nothing but suspect

289
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,600
from found here your system appeared to

290
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,480
become

291
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
comparison free

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
okay

293
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,900
back to cobalt

294
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,560
[Music]

295
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
we can see that

296
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
we remove the

297
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,560
evil deal from registry but the beacon

298
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
still works

299
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
let's use it again

300
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,680
to do another transistor

301
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,959
persistent page distance

302
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,519
okay full screen

303
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,199
okay

304
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,920
let's use the search mode

305
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
get

306
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,040
task

307
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,079
okay

308
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
com100 found

309
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
like valid classic dv stack scheduler

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
is very promising

311
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
let's use this

312
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,719
for persist

313
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,680
for task edger we don't

314
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
don't don't need to add

315
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,880
the class id

316
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
it do it automatically

317
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
okay

318
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,839
commander says that

319
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,480
conversion

320
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
in this system

321
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
okay

322
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,880
let's restart the system again but

323
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,199
no need to restart the system

324
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,680
go back

325
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
and try

326
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,639
to sign out

327
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
okay

328
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,519
and sign in again

329
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,400
they'll become stopped

330
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
but now

331
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
we had

332
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,160
a persistent

333
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
under the process dll host now we have

334
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
persistent under the task scheduler

335
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,440
okay

336
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
let's suppose that

337
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,520
the user

338
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,120
want to sign out again

339
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
bacon stopped

340
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
as you can see

341
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,840
doesn't work

342
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,039
the user will sign in again

343
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,400
a new beacon

344
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
appeared

345
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
every time that the user will sign out

346
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
and will sign in

347
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
we'll take a new beacon and they all

348
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
done

349
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,440
we

350
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
will stop

351
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
okay

352
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,678
let's go from the defense side

353
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,399
okay
