1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,710
I have one my name is Nick metropolis

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,299
and I want to think besides Athens for

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,910
giving an opportunity to speak to you

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,950
guys about security systems I'm quite

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,470
excited that I have this session with

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,730
you and I hope you find it beneficial

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,560
just a bit of background for myself

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,960
before we start off being the security

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,890
industry for about 13 years now so quite

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,330
a long time I've attended a numbers

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,280
courses throughout the years I've also

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,830
managed to get quite a lot of different

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,899
certifications and I do teach quite a

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,349
lot of courses to individuals like comme

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,329
TI EC council and IC square courses so I

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,310
have an opportunity to often speak with

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,800
others and get an understanding of what

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,960
they see being viable in their career

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,209
paths what types of courses they benefit

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,579
from and what types of challenges they

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
often face so the most common challenge

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,570
people have is the course prices this is

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,879
by far one of the most challenging

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,350
aspects of titles so you approach your

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,540
manager and you say I want to do a

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,480
specialized course the course cost six

27
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,360
thousand pounds whoa that's not gonna

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,890
happen anytime soon you have to be in a

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,750
position to create efficient business

30
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,670
cases you have to be able to stand your

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,950
ground you have to be able to justify

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,409
why exactly that course is valuable for

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,450
yourself and also how can that course

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,729
allow you as a person to contribute to

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,619
the wider business in addition to the

36
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,450
course price itself you also have to

37
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,030
think about any exam and renewal

38
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,830
associated costs some exams are fairly

39
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,960
straightforward and cheap while other

40
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,298
ones may be more complicated may span

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,789
across two days and tend to be quite

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,560
more expensive finally you have to

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,479
account for any other associated costs

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640
because if you're taking a course which

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,710
is remote where you are for example you

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,979
have to account for traveling so tickets

47
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,619
for to fly there lodging subsistence and

48
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,539
any other associated expenses now the

49
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,180
time required for you to take a course

50
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,920
might be four or five days but you also

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,530
have to think about the time that it

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,329
will take to absorb the material so you

53
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,820
might attend a course for four days but

54
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,919
it might take six months to actually

55
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,110
study afterwards take any labs and

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,789
ensure that you've solidified any

57
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,670
concepts you've learned in that course

58
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,679
finally the certification exam should

59
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,409
you wish to take it all also account

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
into your time it may be two hours four

61
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,170
hours

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,760
or for complicated certification

63
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,189
attempts it might be even six or eight

64
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,409
hours the attendance mode is another

65
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,150
thing that comes into play some people

66
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,700
learn while they're on the site with a

67
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,730
trainer and in individuals that they can

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,890
ask questions they can converse they can

69
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,510
have interactions with some other people

70
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,298
learn better when they actually do a

71
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,310
course remote also another factor that

72
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,349
comes into play is if you're going to do

73
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,510
a course live or on-demand

74
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,129
now the return of investment is really

75
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,500
important for any type of employer

76
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,870
allowing you to take a course so what

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,120
usually happens is you get your manager

78
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,459
or they get their manager and they

79
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,500
always come down asking so what happens

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,510
with this course what happens if the

81
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,150
individual takes it what is their ROI

82
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,159
for my business so a common question

83
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,810
that pops into mind for a lot of people

84
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,328
is what happens if training people move

85
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,739
on so your manager says what happens if

86
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,139
I give you two or three courses this

87
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,299
year and then next year you move on so

88
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,829
let's try to answer that straightaway by

89
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,840
allowing Richard Branson to actually

90
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,760
answer for us so Richard Branson said

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,799
trained people well enough so they can

92
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,510
leave treat them well enough so they

93
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,819
don't want to the question that comes in

94
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,918
mind after that is what actually happens

95
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,349
if you don't train people and people

96
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,000
stay so how are those individuals going

97
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,608
to be able to work and do their jobs

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,799
properly especially in security what we

99
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:39,690
deal with complicated threats all day

100
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,430
long so our courses simplifications

101
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,500
worth it is it worth the time is it

102
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,099
worth the cost let's see what I will say

103
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,349
a study from is e-square showed the

104
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,440
majority as you see in the slides values

105
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:53,879
how much their skill set improves so 40%

106
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
of the people are from the study

107
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,448
actually answer that they do execute

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,220
courses and get associated

109
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,530
certifications because they want to

110
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,269
improve they want to add a new skill to

111
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,729
what they already have which is quite

112
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,290
impacting now about another third of the

113
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,840
people so 28%

114
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,790
I've actually mentioned that they see

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,769
that as something that they can use to

116
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,659
enhance their CV and this is quite

117
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,940
important for people that are new to the

118
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,488
field so for someone that starts now and

119
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,860
has potentially six months or one year

120
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,960
of experience getting the appropriate

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,900
certifications in order to be able to

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,909
convince potential hiring managers or an

123
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,460
HR team of people that they

124
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,200
good to do the job is quite substantial

125
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,890
most people don't seem to be doing it

126
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,020
for the money

127
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,550
so salary increase doesn't seem to be a

128
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,680
primary reason because if you see the

129
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,750
slide it just comes in sixth place it

130
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,540
definitely isn't the primary reason for

131
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,160
getting certified and lastly another

132
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,170
thing I wanted to highlight is that

133
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,600
about 1/3 of the people do security

134
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,070
courses and certifications because they

135
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,020
do feel that when they attend courses

136
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,020
they do get the expertise that comes

137
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,570
with them now the training budgets come

138
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,969
into play from the business this is a

139
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,940
study from training Mac and it shows an

140
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,370
average of about 1,300 dollars per

141
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,520
person spent across all companies in

142
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:16,770
2019 it's an increase in relation to

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,919
2017 which started with almost $1100 but

144
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,020
it's still quite short now in relation

145
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,060
to specific businesses as you can see

146
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,659
small companies reduced their budget

147
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,590
significantly in comparison to 2017 we

148
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,710
have a decrease from almost $2,000 to

149
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,810
$1500 so 25% decrease Mitas companies

150
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,880
have also dropped from nine hundred and

151
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,070
forty-one dollars to eight hundred and

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,650
twenty nine dollars so about $100

153
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,419
shorter while large companies are the

154
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,549
only ones that seem to have increased

155
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,560
their budget quite substantially the

156
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,169
budget has skyrocketed and it has

157
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,860
actually quadrupled in relation to what

158
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:59,909
it was in 2017 so they went from about

159
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,230
$400 to almost $1,600 in 2019 quite an

160
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,120
investment there from them

161
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,300
this is generic trends by the way now

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,730
let's just jump into a specific focal

163
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,160
study that Deloitte did how financial

164
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:14,160
sector businesses are accumulated

165
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,980
training costs around individuals so as

166
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,260
you see the average is about $2,300 it

167
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,419
ranges from 1,300 all the way up to

168
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,520
$3,000 it does seem to be quite

169
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,490
different it does seem to almost double

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,120
in some cases but again would this be

171
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,430
enough for a security individual would

172
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,560
$3,000 or 2300 which is the average be

173
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,360
enough for them to be able to get the

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,310
training that they need first of all

175
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,610
let's just see some examples of some

176
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,800
security roles on the first row we have

177
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,380
CSIS head of SEC so quite senior

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,810
individuals within organizations then in

179
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,789
the mid role you have meet senior levels

180
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,770
so security architects security

181
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,830
consultants are those types of roles and

182
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,810
in the last row you have mostly

183
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,060
technical roles so incident responders

184
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,680
security engineers quite a lot of

185
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,050
different roles actually that required

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,539
different levels of training some

187
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,699
specific skills that those roles might

188
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,979
have these are just three examples as a

189
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,710
comparison so you have security analyst

190
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,900
security managers and compliance experts

191
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,060
a lot of different skills by required in

192
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,739
different areas we have a security

193
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,020
analyst which requires quite a lot of

194
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,080
soft skills in order to be able to cope

195
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,780
but we do tend to focus quite a lot in

196
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,800
technical skills at that level so

197
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,929
individuals would need to have in-depth

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,389
knowledge around network around host

199
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,520
forensics around malware analysis and

200
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,349
all those sort of skills security

201
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,539
managers net cost and interaction with

202
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,819
c-level executives and also how to have

203
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,020
an ability to manage complex budget as a

204
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,389
team depend on it

205
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,590
they also need to be quite technical

206
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,539
skilled in order to be able to

207
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,729
efficiently drive investigations and

208
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,099
also understand what exactly the

209
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,130
security team is able to do and then we

210
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,880
have an example of a compliance expert

211
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,560
Compliance experts need to be

212
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,060
specialists in a variety of standards

213
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,590
for example GDP our cyber essentials ISO

214
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,150
27001 or any other standard that a

215
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,429
business would need to be compliant with

216
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,080
they need to be very well versed in

217
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,349
dealing with internal and external

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,300
bodies and also very acute in order to

219
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,520
be able to cope with virus teams within

220
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,560
the business let's look at some

221
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,270
questions that come up when we consider

222
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,940
training cost in relation to what we've

223
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,530
discussed first of all we know that

224
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,000
there's a variety of different price

225
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,799
tags for courses we have a lot of

226
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,090
courses that tend to be free and then we

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,029
have some other ones that tend to be

228
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,740
quite cheap and then obviously we have a

229
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,099
lot of courses that tend to be quite

230
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,079
expensive so the first question is which

231
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,450
is the best fit for you so do you

232
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:44,819
believe that a free course or a low cost

233
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,430
course with very best for your team or

234
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,079
for yourselves in order to get the

235
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,599
skills that you need to enter your job

236
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:54,959
the slide shows another study from IC

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,520
square which shows that about 13% of the

238
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,569
people participating in the study have

239
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,030
paid for three

240
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,400
associated certifications through their

241
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,900
companies but there is also almost the

242
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,720
same amount of people that they've paid

243
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,340
for courses themselves which is quite an

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
impacting statement because it seems

245
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,380
that there is quite a lot of gap still

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,790
in how companies invest budgets for

247
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,070
people to get the training they need

248
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,300
sometimes we see companies using

249
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,250
training courses to reward

250
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,260
high-performing employees it happens

251
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,420
quite a lot and we see people saying

252
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,520
that if for example people are

253
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,530
high-performing in the team then the top

254
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,480
two or top three will get a very

255
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,920
expensive course but the question we

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
should be asking is are those

257
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,729
individuals the ones that should be

258
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,830
attending those courses so would you

259
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,900
expect that someone who is already

260
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,610
really good at what they do is the best

261
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,459
person to attend the course to improve

262
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,040
all should be someone that was actually

263
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,140
less skilled or less knowledgeable in

264
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,870
that area certifications also often used

265
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,540
to lure high caliber talent so sometimes

266
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,100
you see in HR ads but they require

267
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,500
candidates who have quite a vast

268
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,050
collection of certifications in order to

269
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,970
wheel them in the challenge is that when

270
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,400
those candidates actually start in the

271
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,410
role they might not get those courses or

272
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,540
they might not give any opportunity to

273
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,130
do training afterwards so this is

274
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,349
something that also happens quite a lot

275
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,320
and then another thing that we see quite

276
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,600
often is training costs or training

277
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,760
budgets becoming tool budgets so for

278
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,860
example because we wanted a new seam or

279
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,930
a new next-generation firewall actually

280
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,180
that budget has been converted into a

281
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,709
tool budget instead now different

282
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,390
approaches with different types of

283
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,640
situations there's a reference light

284
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,100
here showing how many different types of

285
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,750
websites we have and obviously how many

286
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,810
different types of inter courses we have

287
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,850
that are totally free so this is just

288
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,189
sample but there are quite a lot of

289
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,840
these about hi beneficial and a lot of

290
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,610
the vendors offer quite a lot of their

291
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,040
course trainings for free which is

292
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,720
really good for example wireless

293
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,420
trainings are quite good they're all

294
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,130
free for all modules and Splunk offers

295
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,829
their first level of training around

296
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,260
their tool for free and again it's quite

297
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,360
beneficial and so on and so forth so

298
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,270
really good courses that don't

299
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,610
necessarily come with a price tag

300
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,670
now open-source tools are another good

301
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,320
example so as per

302
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,420
for people that are beginners in the

303
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,670
field they can use these tools to get

304
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,589
knowledge around them an experience and

305
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,689
then they can obviously get that

306
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,730
experience and apply it to the workplace

307
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:25,640
now this is a really good reference

308
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,590
slide of various courses that we see

309
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,330
within the security industry the vendors

310
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,220
are ordered alphabetically there's no

311
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,290
preference there different types of

312
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,300
courses again fit different types of

313
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,010
people some people for example want to

314
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,410
do a lot of technical courses for

315
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,960
example they want to do CCNA cyber ops

316
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,240
or CCNP security other people who might

317
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,680
need a more background at the level of

318
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,050
course they might want to be doing

319
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,060
Network class or security plus to get a

320
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,620
basic understanding some more

321
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,540
experienced people within the industry

322
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,150
might want to be doing some courses from

323
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,360
is U square for example like CC SP or

324
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,160
CISSP with specific focal points those

325
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,900
courses would need to be done only if

326
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,550
you have the necessary experience so for

327
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,410
example for CSE speaking need to have

328
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,140
five years of experience about the

329
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,270
industry in order to be accredited the

330
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,880
certification and be a fool is a square

331
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,340
member some people that really like pen

332
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,560
testing might prefer courses from

333
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,420
offensive security or relearned security

334
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,849
so there's a lot of different options

335
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,160
here not just chosen a case study from

336
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,800
Cisco which actually highly demonstrates

337
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,959
a particular path so for example you

338
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,120
might have an individual just now in

339
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,250
their security career and want to get

340
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,220
the maximum out of it that individual

341
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,600
might start with a CCD course or routing

342
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,580
a switching which will give them

343
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,200
obviously the necessary networking

344
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,720
background in order to proceed further

345
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,480
and afterwards they might continue with

346
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,340
getting CCNA cyber ops which is cisco

347
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,320
cyber security track which is a really

348
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,240
interesting certification there's going

349
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,070
to be a professional cyber ops of our

350
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,500
certification released later this year

351
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,450
which is really good if they want to go

352
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,730
towards the network security engineering

353
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,430
track you might see an option for

354
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,500
getting CCMP security and if they quite

355
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,900
like it and they want to dive more into

356
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,370
it they might even go for CCA security

357
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,050
which is one of the top level

358
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,090
certifications that you can achieve in

359
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,719
the industry it's quite challenging to

360
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,670
get now what do people say what do

361
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,580
people see being most valuable in their

362
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,170
security careers IC squared shows that

363
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,649
about

364
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,389
40% of the top certifications are from

365
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:31,420
my ex's square and Cisco so you have

366
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:33,990
CISSP or CSP with a particular

367
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,029
concentration and then you also have

368
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,910
CCNA security and CCNP security but in

369
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:43,600
mind that this study was for 2019 which

370
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,630
was when the older Cisco truck was still

371
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,060
in play so you have CCNA security there

372
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,949
which doesn't exist now and then we also

373
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,199
have another study from InfoSec careers

374
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,969
which haven't depicted here but it still

375
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,630
showed from a number of 200

376
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,370
professionals about 50 percent almost

377
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:03,010
consider CSP to be the best security

378
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,260
certification which quite aligns with

379
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,589
the IC square study that was undertaken

380
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,920
here those individuals after CSS people

381
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:14,649
felt CIS MCH security plus no se beef

382
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,889
now I'm some type of training plan how

383
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,360
can you actually design the ultimate

384
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,889
training plan for your needs so first of

385
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,600
all you can use obviously any free

386
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,279
training that you can get any type of

387
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,350
vendors you already have within your

388
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,630
corporation feel free to get the

389
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,160
training from those they do generally

390
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,500
offer it for free because you've already

391
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
purchased some of the products you can

392
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,100
do internal trainings if you have

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,709
someone who is really good already in

394
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,079
some tools or in some security areas or

395
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,880
in some security certifications even you

396
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,709
can use those individuals to teach

397
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,839
others within the business brown bags

398
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,119
lunch and learns mentor assignments or

399
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,399
some examples of how those people can be

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,440
used positively throughout the company

401
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,420
interesting training is another thing

402
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,670
you can for example have the penetration

403
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,709
testing team sit with the incident

404
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,959
response team and those guys sit with

405
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,959
the security analysis team you can have

406
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,640
meshed capture-the-flag competitions you

407
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,500
can involve management you can do all

408
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,720
sorts of things you can also choose to

409
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,880
train specific individuals in an area

410
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,190
and then use them to train others which

411
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,010
is another really beneficial aspect or

412
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,019
you can get team training packages that

413
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,899
you can leverage from vendors in order

414
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,850
to train your teams as a whole another

415
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,399
option is offering our practical

416
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,649
elements so cyber Rangers CTF those

417
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,810
types of things so for example hack the

418
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,970
Box virtual hacking labs or any other

419
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,979
type of cyber Rangers would allow people

420
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,440
type

421
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,630
gamified a version of learning so they

422
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,430
can actually learn to trying to break

423
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,300
stuff to trying pen testing and those

424
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,729
types of things

425
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,890
self-starting is another option if there

426
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,110
is no significant budget then you can

427
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,970
still try to cover the exam cost and

428
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,550
people can self-study for their specific

429
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,690
certification courses then you can

430
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,099
include training courses and

431
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,140
certifications in your personal

432
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,180
development plan which is really good

433
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,730
and I highly recommend it because it

434
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,040
allows you to have this as a part of

435
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,870
what you do throughout the year so if

436
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,670
you manage to get this approved through

437
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,650
your development plan there's no one

438
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,750
that will come afterwards and try to not

439
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,370
allow you to take that training the

440
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,860
combined it will approach in general is

441
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,420
what works you can combine three courses

442
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,210
I like the ones that we just discussed

443
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,310
earlier with self-study and then if you

444
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,900
want to take at least one paid course

445
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,130
which will maximize what you get

446
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,319
throughout the year that would be the

447
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,000
ideal approach if you knew if you're a

448
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,500
newbie in the security field then you

449
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,080
just try and oversee to get your foot

450
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,120
through the door with HR again you can

451
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,100
look up getting some of the most common

452
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,410
security certifications that are being

453
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,240
looked at by a chart for example if you

454
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,100
want to be a security analyst shortly

455
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,800
you might look at getting a solid

456
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,680
foundation around security plus of Cisco

457
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,020
CCNA M Cisco CCNA cyber ops and both

458
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,790
types of courses and then as I said

459
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,410
earlier experimenting the device

460
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,290
open-source tools is quite beneficial

461
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,000
because it allows you to have experience

462
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,339
that you can demonstrate when you have

463
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,589
those discussions I've also built two

464
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,270
scenarios just to show you a practical

465
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,099
aspect of how you can build up these

466
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,079
types of trainings so for example the

467
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,359
first scenario is for our person who is

468
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,220
quite new and they're placed in a team

469
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,560
which has a very limited training budget

470
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,000
that individual can actually attend any

471
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,770
free courses that they can get their

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
hands on so for example through Coursera

473
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,760
or through udemy they can also

474
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,829
self-study for particular basic

475
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,830
certifications because they tend to be

476
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,050
easier to absorb and they can actually

477
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,030
do that without necessarily attending an

478
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,180
official course which might cost quite a

479
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,830
lot examples as I said are CCNA in CCNA

480
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,620
cyber herbs really good foundational

481
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,760
certifications network plus and security

482
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,459
plus certified ethical hacker

483
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,070
security analyst or junior penetration

484
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,440
tester there is a mix of skills that an

485
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,020
individual can actually absorb you can

486
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,270
also have a free visual lab in your

487
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,370
machine or you can actually use an

488
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,230
online available one like hack the box

489
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,719
which actually comes at a very very

490
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,580
logical price all of those things are

491
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,320
quite beneficial and all of them are

492
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,570
quite achievable with a very very

493
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,030
limited training budget and then the

494
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,860
second scenario I have is in relation to

495
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,678
a security manager or any type of

496
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,110
manager for that matter who has a very

497
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,030
medium-sized training budget now if

498
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,219
you're the manager or a team lead then

499
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,168
obviously you want to do training for

500
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,480
the whole team you should try to focus

501
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,580
on getting anything courses approved so

502
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,440
for example if you approach a vendor

503
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,870
with training passes or getting training

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,880
credits you can always get a discount

505
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,709
which will be quite beneficial for the

506
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,890
team versus individuals just getting

507
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,110
approved by themselves also if you using

508
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,059
multiple tools within a business it's

509
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,949
not always feasible to have everyone

510
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,928
trained on the tools so for example if

511
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,390
you use 20 tools it might not be

512
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:51,460
feasible for everyone within the team to

513
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,919
get individual training to all those

514
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,840
tools in those cases it's really

515
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,150
beneficial to have a specific subject

516
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,689
matter expert and then allow that person

517
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,460
to get full training while they aid the

518
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,559
rest of the team as much as possible and

519
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,059
get them trained up it's kind of train

520
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,910
the trainer approach and for any

521
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,700
specialty courses in security then you

522
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,380
would need to devote time and budget in

523
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,150
order to allow those individuals who

524
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,580
attend those courses for example if you

525
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,559
expect your team to be a high-performing

526
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,870
Incident Response Team high-performing

527
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,668
Incident handlers then you will need to

528
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,530
allow them to attend at least one

529
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,929
specialty course throughout the year to

530
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,870
get those specialized skills they need

531
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:33,970
in order to do the job now after some

532
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,928
final thoughts first of all there is no

533
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,390
one-size-fits-all

534
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:39,220
you can't funnel this in for everyone

535
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,450
you can't say to everyone you all get

536
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,120
this training you'll all get the same

537
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,520
thing it just doesn't work you have to

538
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,989
spend time with people get accustom with

539
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,330
what they want what their aspirations

540
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,520
are their career progression and also

541
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,040
fit that into account with what the team

542
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,779
expects I try to leverage particular

543
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,489
individual plans for everyone

544
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,200
they're always gonna be budget

545
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:01,239
constraints there's no question around

546
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,309
it just try not to let it stop you

547
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,779
doesn't matter the constraint just would

548
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,279
put the different approaches we just

549
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:07,659
discussed training should be for

550
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,639
everyone it shouldn't just be for a

551
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:11,049
selected team of people so in my mind

552
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,059
you shouldn't be rewarding

553
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,158
high-performing individuals or it

554
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,869
shouldn't be only allowing one or two

555
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,450
people within a team to get specific

556
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:21,340
types of high end trainings that usually

557
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,099
frustrates a lot of people because they

558
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,049
also want to get the training they see

559
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,089
others getting and it frustrates them

560
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:29,619
quite a lot when they can so you have to

561
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:30,158
be very careful when you do those types

562
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:31,869
of things

563
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,999
the other thing you always need to

564
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,649
account for in your mind is did you

565
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,539
actually want the people protecting your

566
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,699
business to have an adequate training so

567
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:41,589
whenever you get pushback from higher

568
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,960
management you always have to take this

569
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:45,940
into account it's okay when people come

570
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,159
to you and say we don't have a budget or

571
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,259
whatever like that but you always have

572
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,570
to pose this question okay we don't have

573
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:55,239
a budget or we have limited budget but

574
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,918
how are these folks going to protect the

575
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,359
business especially when they deal with

576
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,629
incidence that might cost the business

577
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,549
millions and lastly always encourage

578
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,769
people to take some time from their week

579
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,960
in order to do training or any type of

580
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:11,049
research for that matter I know that a

581
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,509
lot of us in security were quite

582
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,219
extensive hours so allowing people to

583
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,229
take for example three or four hours

584
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,820
through the week in order to devote it

585
00:21:17,229 --> 00:21:20,739
to something like this is really

586
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,109
beneficial for the mental health as well

587
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:24,879
it keeps them focused and then you also

588
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:26,978
have to remember that creativity is

589
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:29,199
really important it's almost equally

590
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:31,029
important productivity because the

591
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,369
research that individuals do might

592
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:35,379
benefit your team quite substantially

593
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,389
think of your team think on what they

594
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:39,369
need most what you need most in order to

595
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:41,258
protect the business and that should

596
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:42,939
guide you grout if you have any

597
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,889
questions please do feel free to reach

598
