1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:08,660
hello it is a pleasure to be part of

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,480
this year's virtual besides Earth and

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,030
event obviously due to the covert 19

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,369
situation it is not possible to be

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,290
together in person this year but it is

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,349
great to see the event still going ahead

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:24,738
in virtual format and I hope that you

8
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,899
can all still enjoy it online firstly I

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,899
would like to wish you your family and

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:32,329
your colleagues all the very best and

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,629
that you stay safe during this global

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:38,149
crisis what I would like to reflect on

13
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:40,670
in this talk is the changing

14
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,359
cybersecurity landscape that we've seen

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,149
over the last few years and specifically

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,579
from the lens of the defensive

17
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:53,239
perspective of how you will go about

18
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:56,480
defending a large modern distributed

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,519
enterprise hi I'm Kevin Jones I am the

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,699
group chief information security officer

21
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,309
at Arras and I am responsible for the

22
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,130
cyber protection of Airbus globally and

23
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:11,840
across divisions so we have a huge task

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,240
to do what do I mean though by a cyber

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,820
security in the modern distributed

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,399
enterprise well let me take a bus as the

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,639
example and you've all heard of Airbus

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,970
as one of the world's largest commercial

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,300
aircraft manufacturing but what you may

30
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,270
not know is that Airbus is also Europe's

31
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,039
largest helicopter manufacturer and we

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,369
also have the defense and space division

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,430
that makes military aircraft is Europe's

34
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:44,470
largest satellites designer launch build

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,940
and operator and we have a plethora of

36
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,910
security products including a cyber

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,640
security business that provides

38
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:58,759
high-grade cyber security to a lot of

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,860
Europe's military we are truly a global

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,650
enterprise we have about a hundred and

41
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,430
thirty four thousand workforce globally

42
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,200
which translates by the way into roughly

43
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,180
300,000 endpoints that we have to

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,209
protect

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,790
we operate in 35 countries and a hundred

46
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,189
and eighty sites worldwide

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,970
in addition to that we have

48
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:25,280
approximately 12,000 suppliers the form

49
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,400
part of our critical supply chain that

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,689
we have to make sure keep their parts or

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,269
their components or whatever their

52
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,840
manufacturing and supplying to us

53
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:38,590
flowing like most organizations of our

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,239
size Airbus is also undergoing a

55
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,269
significant digital transformation at

56
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,500
the moment so as well as protecting all

57
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,790
of our different sites different

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,129
locations all of our user group we're

59
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,040
also making a significant transformation

60
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,470
towards the adoption of cloud

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,470
technologies much more as well in terms

62
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,629
of our manufacturing plants and how we

63
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,810
make them integrated with factory of the

64
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:09,980
future and bring IOT devices into that

65
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:13,730
particular environment in addition we're

66
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,200
also looking at how we better use things

67
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,170
like machine learning and artificial

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,619
intelligence on our data and make it

69
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,388
much more effective for the business so

70
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,000
not only do we have a huge and

71
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:29,150
significant landscape we're also going

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,239
through an evolving and agile digital

73
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,949
transformation all of which we have to

74
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,919
protect from cyber threats so how do we

75
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:43,609
do that how is cyber security organized

76
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:47,389
The Devil's well firstly cyber security

77
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:51,199
nervous is not just about IT we operate

78
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,419
distinctly in four pillars IT being

79
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,220
obviously a very large and significant

80
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,579
pillar with the IT landscape that we

81
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,889
operate globally but it's also important

82
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:03,319
that we consider the fact that Airbus is

83
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,840
one of Europe's largest manufacturing

84
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,828
companies we make aircraft satellites

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,810
helicopters so protection of our

86
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,750
manufacturing plants and our industrial

87
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,889
environments also forms a key part of

88
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,720
our cyber security program thirdly we

89
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,639
operate around the cyber protection of

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,180
the products themselves how do we

91
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,070
protect them from cyber threats and

92
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,739
finally the fourth part of our pillar or

93
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,779
fourth pillar is people

94
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:35,448
how do we go about protecting the people

95
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,639
that operate in our environment and make

96
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:42,769
sure that they are a key part of our

97
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:45,589
cyber defenses to do this we operate a

98
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:48,049
federated cybersecurity organization

99
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:51,799
which we think is relatively unique so

100
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:54,289
it's worth touching on as the group sees

101
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:55,959
oh I have accountability across and

102
00:04:54,289 --> 00:05:00,318
visibility across all of the divisions

103
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:02,329
but each division has its own Caesar or

104
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,339
divisional digital security officer as

105
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:07,429
we call them because of the four pillar

106
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:10,159
nature that we operate in now

107
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:13,698
each division is legally accountable and

108
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:15,529
runs their operations locally we will

109
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,229
also then have local teams in

110
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:20,719
engineering for example for our cyber

111
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,969
protection of product we all have local

112
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,219
teams in manufacturing for the cyber

113
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:27,199
protection of the production lines but

114
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:30,409
we have to have a way of coordinating

115
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,689
that so we centralized the reporting we

116
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:36,498
centralized the coordination and we

117
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:38,239
centralize the strategy if you like for

118
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:40,069
how we're going to implement all across

119
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:42,169
levels and that's what we termed the

120
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,889
federated model now not many

121
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:49,339
organizations today operate in that way

122
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:52,839
before how a particular environment it's

123
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:55,610
so far proving exceptionally effective

124
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,979
we also have a corporate level

125
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,439
key capabilities so we have things like

126
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,748
risk management we have enterprise

127
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,509
security architects that look all across

128
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:07,549
the estate and we'll do our urban ISM as

129
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,739
you like so they're the city planners of

130
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:12,349
our infrastructure and make sure that we

131
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:16,039
keep the standards everywhere that we

132
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:18,219
will expect we also have a detection and

133
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,229
response capability at corporate level

134
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:24,558
working with our I am colleagues to form

135
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:27,438
effectively the cert and the Sauk so

136
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:29,959
once we detect something unusual in the

137
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,029
infrastructure the certain the Sauk will

138
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,699
go about their escalation business and

139
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:37,189
will then try and remediating mitigate

140
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,369
or put controls in place and I'll come

141
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,339
to some of that later on in the talk we

142
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:44,460
also have a corporate level our own red

143
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:48,539
team our evaluate

144
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,638
testing so these are our pen testers our

145
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,530
deep dive specialists that can reverse

146
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,289
engineer and do code verification

147
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,448
validation for us and they will do the

148
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,960
red teaming activities they're the

149
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:04,590
people that attack us for us to make

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,049
sure that we have preempted the attack

151
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,599
path and can already start working on

152
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,630
our mitigations and our detection x' in

153
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,009
architecture and response and finally we

154
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,919
have an innovation and scouting team

155
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,720
that is very much forward looking into

156
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,609
the future and is developing

157
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,419
capabilities that an organization like

158
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,300
Airbus needs to protect itself sometimes

159
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,590
that can be unique customizations of

160
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,740
technologies that already exist

161
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,229
sometimes it can be completely new

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,810
technology that is bespoke to Airbus and

163
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,849
other times it can be just making sure

164
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,460
we have the right knowledge that is

165
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:45,000
relevant to our business we adopt a

166
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,340
compliance regulation and a risk-based

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,979
approach so some parts of our business

168
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,409
are highly regulated their safety

169
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,080
critical parts and therefore we have to

170
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:57,180
follow the highest standards and make

171
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,698
sure we're implementing security that is

172
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,699
pervasive in everything we do

173
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,050
we are obviously required to be

174
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:09,599
compliant to IT regulations like gdpr

175
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:13,110
and other standards that we adopt to

176
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,389
make sure that we are consistent in our

177
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,030
cybersecurity approach and that we're

178
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,370
able to consider ourselves adopting the

179
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,219
best-in-class that the cyber security

180
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,330
has to offer some security community has

181
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:29,849
to offer on the risk-based side

182
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,889
obviously everything we want to do has

183
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,458
to adopt a risk-based model what are we

184
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,539
doing to reduce that cyber risk for ours

185
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,809
finally something I think that is

186
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:44,250
important to note is that we adopt the

187
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:48,510
cybersecurity ethos in Airbus is all

188
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,370
about people process and technology

189
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,170
preferably in that order

190
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,480
so we don't just adopt the latest

191
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,339
state-of-the-art technologies we also

192
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,580
want to make sure that our processes are

193
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,770
right and

194
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,190
that we're adopting a people centric

195
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:05,740
approach to everything that we do some

196
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,960
of that is fairly unique and is related

197
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,940
to the scale in which we operate and

198
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,820
some of it is just adopting

199
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,820
best-in-class design for what we do I

200
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,810
should say at this point the defender

201
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,540
will always has to be going through a

202
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,670
cybersecurity transformation as well but

203
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,860
I want to switch my mindset slightly for

204
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,770
a moment and when we're looking at how I

205
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,470
would defend the network we should first

206
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,439
look at how an attacker would come about

207
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,780
attacking an organization like us and

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,670
it's always useful to adopt the

209
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,339
methodologies that are already out there

210
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,829
and I use the Cal chain example for that

211
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,840
so I think it's worth going through that

212
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,300
Cal chain for those of you who are not

213
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,310
aware of it obviously at the beginning

214
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,280
of an attack the adversary will do

215
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,170
reconnaissance both prominently external

216
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,819
to your infrastructure so that we

217
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,510
started doing social media mining

218
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,880
building capabilities around your your

219
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,400
business learning how you work before

220
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,590
they even touch your infrastructure then

221
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,689
the reconnaissance moves towards shall I

222
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,940
say external scanning of the networks

223
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,160
and of the infrastructures so that's the

224
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,110
point at which the adversary is trying

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,360
to see what you have what your digital

226
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:24,730
footprint is on the estate once that

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,290
reconnaissance phase is actually adopted

228
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,510
is completed you will see the

229
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,750
weaponization phase so this is when the

230
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:35,069
adversary is picking what type of attack

231
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,110
tools they want to use and they could be

232
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,360
advanced tools that you can procure or

233
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,080
they could be customized tools that the

234
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,170
attacker is making for this specific

235
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,720
type of mission then you go through the

236
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,880
delivery phase and that's obviously

237
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,400
where you want to get The Dropper or the

238
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,320
malware or you want to be able to try

239
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,060
and move laterally through the network

240
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,680
to put your tools in the right place and

241
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,800
you can also live off the land if you

242
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,839
like so a lot of apt adversaries will

243
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,209
use traditional network admin type tools

244
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,740
in their modus operandi

245
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:16,099
then we want to do the exploitation

246
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:20,899
phase so the exploitation is whatever

247
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,309
type of privilege you can get depending

248
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,889
on where you land in the infrastructure

249
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:27,350
so you want to have a look to see what's

250
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:29,839
on the internal estate you want to try

251
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,269
and put your tools in gain privileges

252
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:39,290
move laterally and really try and do the

253
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:40,850
installation phase of your attack then

254
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,769
you're doing either something like

255
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:46,069
command and control to make sure you can

256
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:49,579
keep that at that particular connection

257
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:51,469
to the infrastructure all your executing

258
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,359
whatever type of attack that you think

259
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,569
it's going to be or you want it to be to

260
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,279
have the impact um

261
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,719
the actions and objectives then once

262
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,550
they're complete whether that's data

263
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,410
exfiltration whether that's to cause

264
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:09,618
damage or whatever that might be is

265
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,050
notionally the last phase of the kill

266
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:14,269
check if I'm being very honest with you

267
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,670
an advanced diverse route will have an

268
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,980
extra stage to the kill chain which is

269
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,660
not traditionally spoken of and that

270
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,730
advanced stage is what I would call the

271
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,860
cleanup phase for the attacker how do

272
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,499
you cover your tracks once you've

273
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,179
completed all how do you move in such a

274
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:33,319
way around the infrastructure that you

275
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:35,869
want to be undetected however we've

276
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,839
we've done a lot as a community to

277
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:41,240
understand this particular attack path

278
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,999
in this particular way that adversary's

279
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,809
work and we also therefore have a

280
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:50,569
significant number of tools in our

281
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:55,129
defenders toolkit and generally speaking

282
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:57,589
we divide them into architecture or

283
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,439
monitoring type of tools specifically

284
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:03,019
all the process type of activities that

285
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:06,290
we're going to go ahead and do so on the

286
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:08,839
architecture side obviously when an

287
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,449
adversary's lands on a box or in a web

288
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,149
portal or something like that and we

289
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:16,969
want to make it as difficult as possible

290
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:20,209
for that adversary to a live on that box

291
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,529
and be to try and move anywhere else in

292
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,709
the infrastructure whether that's an

293
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,670
endpoint whether that's

294
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,590
whether that's a web server in a DMZ we

295
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:32,069
want to make sure that we are always

296
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,950
protected by architecture and there's a

297
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,240
couple of new things that are coming in

298
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,400
when we talk about architecture that are

299
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,900
really useful multi-factor

300
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,780
authentication has been around for a

301
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,600
while now quite some time and is

302
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,800
actually really effective at making an

303
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,010
adversary when they've stolen

304
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,140
credentials from trying to be

305
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,130
authenticated from a second device it's

306
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,080
not foolproof

307
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,240
you can still spoof a user into giving

308
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,270
you the passcode or the key or clicking

309
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,980
on the token that appears on their smart

310
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:07,860
phone but it really helps with stolen

311
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,590
credentials and if MFA's in place you

312
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,450
can detect when you have failures in mfa

313
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,840
as well and start reacting and

314
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,540
responding to them there are however a

315
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,540
much more modern and up-and-coming

316
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,189
technique which is generally termed zero

317
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,260
trust networking with zero trust

318
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,050
architecture and that is when you

319
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,620
encapsulate around your network around

320
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,599
your applications and around your data a

321
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,070
real authentic ation check because you

322
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,670
don't trust your network anymore

323
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,730
and the idea of zero trust is obviously

324
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,560
every time a user accesses a resource on

325
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,130
your network you real authentic eight

326
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,959
the user the problem with that is if you

327
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,240
had to enter your username password all

328
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,640
do an mfa challenge every time you

329
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,790
access something you would soon give up

330
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,640
it's not very user friendly so this is

331
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,610
where zero trust uses and leverages

332
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,280
machine learning techniques to learn

333
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,490
about the user as that lot as that login

334
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,939
happens it learns behavior for a user

335
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,160
over a prolonged period of time and you

336
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,590
can set parameters in your

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,680
infrastructure for things that user can

338
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,600
do depending on the given trust level of

339
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,689
that axis and I'll give you some

340
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,440
concrete examples if a user logs in from

341
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:30,780
a different country within moments of

342
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,060
having logged in in your LAN on your

343
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,730
network then there's probably something

344
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,279
not trustworthy about that second

345
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,920
and we might want to at that point flag

346
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,500
a second challenge and MFA challenge to

347
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,800
the user or if your policy states just

348
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,709
block that access and won it in addition

349
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,389
you can also do things like if a user is

350
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:53,760
accessing resources they don't normally

351
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,829
access there might be a valid business

352
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,990
reason for that but you might just want

353
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:01,050
to do a second MFA check just to make

354
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,579
sure but what about the endpoints itself

355
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,769
what about where the attacker first

356
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:07,290
lands well there's some good techniques

357
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,690
here as well we've seen the adoption of

358
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,910
things like micron virtualization so

359
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,670
effectively putting a mini VM around

360
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,939
each application there's some challenges

361
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,819
to use a adoption for that but actually

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,570
if the attacker has to break out of an

363
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,490
application a VM even if they use

364
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,149
something like a buffer overflow attack

365
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,920
I think can install into the application

366
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,350
it's very difficult to break out

367
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,500
somewhere else into the box and

368
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,680
similarly EDR techniques and tools are

369
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,500
becoming very widely adopted the monitor

370
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,388
all of the behavior on that box to see

371
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,579
what is going on and can block certain

372
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:50,160
actions certain behaviors and report

373
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,410
everything back to your sock or your

374
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,560
skin operations to be able to respond

375
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,560
accordingly

376
00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:00,329
we've also seen a prevalence of things

377
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,040
like data loss prevention DLP tools that

378
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,260
specifically look at the data that's

379
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,839
held on that box or the data access that

380
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,559
comes from that box or that user and

381
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,780
again similarly any unusual behaviors

382
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,879
can be blocked or a policy can state

383
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,459
that you can't access this resource this

384
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,740
data type or that area and specifically

385
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,140
you can also do things like USB blocking

386
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,109
or CD blocking or email blocking around

387
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,630
data a deal piece is very very useful

388
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,330
for syntactic and semantic matching of

389
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,549
data types and you can really automate

390
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,949
the data that is on the box and the data

391
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,710
that user can have access to and that's

392
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,340
really good for both insider type

393
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,990
attacks and also if the user has clicked

394
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,928
on a phishing link downloaded something

395
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,880
to their box it prevents a an external

396
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,530
adversary than doing malicious things as

397
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,270
well

398
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,710
cloud security is a big thing we're

399
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,960
seeing the emergence of things like

400
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,120
cloud data focus we're seeing the

401
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,310
emergence of clarity encryption

402
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,260
techniques and the cloud operators

403
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,710
themselves of really providing this as a

404
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,960
service predominantly but it's up to any

405
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,120
organization adopting the clouds that

406
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,730
make sure firstly their cloud

407
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,909
environments are secured properly and

408
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,440
configured properly so there are

409
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,540
automated tools to help you with that

410
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,660
that prevent the risk of cyber attack on

411
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,190
your cloud and even then encrypting all

412
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,770
your data when it's on the cloud is

413
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,780
absolutely key but one of the most

414
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,670
interesting areas I think that we've

415
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,160
seen developing is the notion of

416
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,930
deceptive wear so tools that will put

417
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,610
fake credentials throughout your network

418
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,730
throwing your endpoints through

419
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,080
infrastructure to try and a slow down an

420
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,660
attacker because they don't know if this

421
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,780
credential is valid or not and B to

422
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,040
operate effectively like a honey trap so

423
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,450
that if one of these credentials is

424
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,879
trying to be used somewhere else in your

425
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,940
network you immediately know that

426
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,440
something's not quite right and then

427
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,790
finally looking ahead on the network

428
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,800
side we're seeing things like

429
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,750
software-defined networking that has

430
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,030
real potential to allow localized

431
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,530
policies a much more fine-grained

432
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,290
control over your network

433
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,170
infrastructures on the security

434
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,360
monitoring side this is obviously where

435
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,840
we have things like security operators

436
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,850
security orchestration and automation cm

437
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,310
tools have been used with orchestration

438
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:23,280
automation to make the first line much

439
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:25,530
more automated to deal with the deluge

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,270
of alerts that's coming in and obviously

441
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,670
the more security tools that you put in

442
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,560
place the more data you're getting into

443
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,380
your security operation centers to

444
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,629
detect the anomalies we're also seeing

445
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,420
the emergence of a machine learning

446
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,180
being applied to try and filter out the

447
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,100
noise and the dualities and therefore

448
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,280
you can concentrate much more on the

449
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,889
collective view of your systems and of

450
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,010
what's going on and you can respond much

451
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,080
much more quickly if you're automating

452
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,450
the process in your security operation

453
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,090
centers there are still challenges when

454
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,140
it comes to things like for example

455
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,730
industrial environments and how you

456
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,980
integrate sock into

457
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,350
dusty environment an abbess has already

458
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,960
gone down that path deploying certain

459
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:13,139
technologies and and improving our

460
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,540
forensic readiness even in industrial

461
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,660
environments that are not traditional IT

462
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,490
environments as well so very much an

463
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,460
important area I should say by the way

464
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,799
therefore all the tools things like for

465
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,600
example prop Mon and syslog are still

466
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,700
valuable data types for this is for the

467
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,879
sock but then you have to manage the

468
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,160
large data volumes that comes with that

469
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,740
so even if an attacker does land on an

470
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,690
end point the modern enterprise will

471
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,840
have tools and techniques to try and

472
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,750
prevent that movement and the relevant

473
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,000
monitoring techniques to detect unusual

474
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,809
behaviors in the infrastructure to try

475
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,970
and move quickly however we still want

476
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,610
to think like an attacker and this is

477
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,530
where we have our own red team coming

478
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,659
and our red team will do for example

479
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,720
deep dive evaluations to find

480
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,160
vulnerabilities in the products that we

481
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,530
buy and the products that we make as

482
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,929
well before lashing to make sure we have

483
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:12,480
the highest standards of security the

484
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:15,690
pentest team will perform pen tests

485
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,250
across our entire state preferably as

486
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:22,380
early as possible in the development

487
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:24,530
lifecycle with pre deployment testing as

488
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,419
we want to go from that element and

489
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:30,690
really thinking like an attacker having

490
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:33,179
a dedicated red team and pen test makes

491
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,429
a company much more secure because we're

492
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,350
finding things before our systems go

493
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:41,070
live and we're able to very quickly

494
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,649
verify and work with the blue team's the

495
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,049
defending teams to be able to work on

496
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:50,040
hypotheses when we see alerts that might

497
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:52,620
come in and finally just to conclude -

498
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,470
that it's not just a technical view of

499
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,780
the world we have to take and adopt a

500
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,600
human centric cybersecurity approach and

501
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,360
everything that we do and Evers has one

502
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,370
of Europe's first dedicated research and

503
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,830
innovation teams to human centric

504
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,110
cybersecurity so we look to make sure we

505
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,780
have best-in-class awareness but also

506
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,030
take techniques that are natural and

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,600
normal to the aviation industry like

508
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,200
black box thinking

509
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,090
if an event occurs and we launch a

510
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,220
investigation for example are we doing

511
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,860
the right things we need to look back at

512
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,710
every reason why we got to that stage of

513
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,469
the investigation and take a real human

514
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,970
view at it it's not a blame culture it's

515
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,860
really looking at things through

516
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,910
different lens and making sure we

517
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,159
haven't missed anything

518
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,310
so human-centric is really key and

519
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,930
really important we do however still

520
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,379
have challenges as an industry as a

521
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:49,650
whole now looking outside of evers

522
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,420
firstly on the red team or pentest site

523
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:53,740
I've been very specific that you have to

524
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,960
think like an attacker

525
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,240
we do a lot of work pen testing Web Apps

526
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,660
but what does that mean how does that

527
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,080
deliver value for the business and how

528
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,330
does that translate into shall I say the

529
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,330
impact it could have further down the

530
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,980
line when you chain these things

531
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,439
everything you do as a red team or pen

532
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:17,110
test has to be done legally and it has

533
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,600
to be done ethically engage the

534
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,520
businesses that want to engage with you

535
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,850
look for things like vulnerability

536
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,040
disclosure policies but don't just go

537
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,879
and pen test infrastructure without

538
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,310
permissions so work with people or be

539
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,130
part of an in-house team or a team is

540
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:38,230
contracted by a company to do that and

541
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,730
really think about the system itself

542
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,560
think holistically

543
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,940
not just about the software stack in

544
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,190
front of you think about what it's

545
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,970
running on where it's going to be most

546
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,380
importantly be part of the community

547
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,570
second issue I think you have as a whole

548
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,640
can be a whole community is security

549
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,250
metrics and risk management generally

550
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,720
speaking we're not very good at

551
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,600
presenting risk metrics that make sense

552
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,090
to a company and especially escalating

553
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,740
that to the board so we need to really

554
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,679
think carefully about how we present our

555
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,780
work whether that is a results of a pen

556
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,360
test and an audit or whether that is a

557
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,930
the current operational state or risk

558
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,320
state of a business the biggest killer

559
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:22,120
to all of us is complex systems of

560
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,340
systems so how do we work with

561
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,040
complexity how to manage that complexity

562
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,540
as we integrate more and more through

563
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,639
our environments think of the global

564
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,190
scale at which airbus operates

565
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,200
it's hugely complex and how do we manage

566
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,000
that how do we control that and to a

567
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,000
certain extent how do we automate our

568
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,010
security as much as possible on the

569
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,530
dates of classification site you can't

570
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,610
protect what you don't know so really we

571
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,379
need a lot of work on dates a

572
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,659
classification to make sure we know

573
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:54,340
where the data is and what type of theta

574
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:56,800
it is finally the other area I think is

575
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,629
probably most important to look at is

576
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,149
playbooks and incident response plans

577
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,560
make sure that you have a playbook and

578
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,630
an incident response plan that is

579
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,700
appropriate make sure by the way a

580
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,770
playbook is not a prescriptive this is

581
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,300
exactly what you do it's these are the

582
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,550
right people you call and you bring them

583
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,889
in so generally speaking is that

584
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:17,790
community need to share or play books

585
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,950
look like what they are and upskill

586
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:23,230
other organizations in how large players

587
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,600
do it what I also want to look at is

588
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,780
slightly beyond the perimeter so key

589
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,050
message is we used to have this model of

590
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,210
the security perimeter of an aspect be

591
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,850
under no illusions in the modern

592
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:39,490
distributed enterprise the perimeter is

593
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,730
gone the perimeter is dead we're now

594
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,130
dealing with multiple suppliers data out

595
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,540
counting suppliers networks

596
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,520
interconnectivity between suppliers and

597
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,879
our own portals we have cloud

598
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,520
technologies we are really running more

599
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,980
and more services so we need to think

600
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,930
differently about how we protect our

601
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,140
infrastructure and how we provide cyber

602
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:04,240
security firstly application development

603
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,810
as it's been done either by suppliers

604
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,520
the applications we're buying and also

605
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,919
the applications we're doing in-house

606
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,930
that may live either in or outside of

607
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,200
our perimeter we have to adopt

608
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,270
best-in-class things like dev sec ops to

609
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,710
be able to do that think about your

610
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,230
cloud infrastructure in your cloud

611
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,110
estate for most organizations how do we

612
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,110
protect that and we've seen a lot of the

613
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,459
highly advertised data breaches that

614
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,409
have occurred over the last four or five

615
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:35,950
years have been because of cloud

616
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:38,200
technologies not being secured by the

617
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,110
supply chain is also a hugely important

618
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,750
area for what we want to protect if you

619
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,350
have data in your suppliers or data in

620
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,330
to conspire

621
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,740
interconnected with you you still have

622
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,659
to protect that as part of your

623
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,049
infrastructure and there is ways it

624
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,090
means you could do that also physical

625
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:56,950
security and extended enterprise so

626
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,459
those that connect to you how do you

627
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:03,070
protect your key assets physically when

628
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,049
they're on your site without that you

629
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,520
don't have good security and I will

630
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:08,620
remind you that you need to do that

631
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,980
across all four pillars that we spoke

632
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,239
about earlier so IT industrial and even

633
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,460
if you're not a manufacturing company

634
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,980
you will inevitably have things like

635
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,720
logistics or heating and ventilation

636
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,360
systems that are inter connected to your

637
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,710
network now so consider those for those

638
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,168
of you make something whether it's a

639
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,669
product that is physical or whether it's

640
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:31,360
a software product you need to think

641
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:34,150
about that as well and people so finally

642
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,539
I want to leave you quickly with some of

643
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:40,750
my key takeaways things to remember when

644
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:42,700
you're doing defense security firstly

645
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,460
put cyber security at risk at the board

646
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,380
level if possible you have to escalate

647
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,020
security of your organization as high as

648
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,539
possible to make sure that the board is

649
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:56,260
discussing it on a regular basis to get

650
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:59,169
the support that you need in Airbus I do

651
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,908
not sit in IT actually I sit under the

652
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,860
chief security officer and I have a

653
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,140
counterpart who is the head of I am IT

654
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,260
cybersecurity and we work very closely

655
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,929
together and together we present to the

656
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,820
board always follow your data

657
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,100
the modern district Enterprise your data

658
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,158
is everywhere and you must follow the

659
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,678
data wherever it goes

660
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,710
consider IOT and infrastructure in your

661
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,020
cybersecurity program it's a must for

662
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,480
all organizations especially where you

663
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,190
have new smart technology smart

664
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,500
buildings heating and ventilation

665
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,090
systems or even if you're using IOT

666
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,549
sensors for various things around your

667
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,370
operations that is part of your

668
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:41,110
cybersecurity program and that includes

669
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:45,158
things that are not necessarily managed

670
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:47,500
by IT in your estate monitor your supply

671
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,570
chain and extended enterprise absolutely

672
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,760
key if you're going to have an incident

673
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,850
and it can come from your supply chain

674
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,530
or incident on your supply chain can

675
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,909
have major impact on your business

676
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,830
find security matrix that makes sense

677
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,840
and they're not necessarily IT security

678
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,080
metrics but they might be depending on

679
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,149
the type of organization you are think

680
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,520
like an attacker in everything you do as

681
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:13,020
a defender because that way you will end

682
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,190
up being mature and make sure you're

683
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,940
operating with state-of-the-art

684
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:23,310
techniques and finally plan for a cyber

685
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,870
incident and test that plan you've got

686
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,030
to test it the first time you're testing

687
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,969
that plan is not in a real incident so

688
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:33,120
you must be prepared and mature for your

689
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,860
cyber defense so that's the view that I

690
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,320
would like to give you from the

691
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,320
defenders perspective I appreciate your

692
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:44,610
time thank you very much for listening

693
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,710
to me I would once again like to wish

694
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,429
you all the best and stay safe during

695
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,430
this time
