supporting so two words 3 or 4 etcetera

465
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:14,550
and then write a report valuable person

466
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:16,980
picked on our website screwed news media

467
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,960
the fact that is robert is an easy to

468

469
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,970
nice to exploit although that

470
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:32,080
these scans often comes in for are not

yes Apple which is far worse than I

474
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,970
believe most importantly you should pass

00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:50,440
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit report unlike</font>

people who goes on to that floor so

477
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,810
that'll make this all wrong I think

478
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,490
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place and it is the wall</font>
