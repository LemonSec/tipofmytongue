00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,820
five years one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I used</font>

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is a distance responsive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so due to</font>

00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the response and they also some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're listed up</font>

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,270
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlantic keep things about</font>

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,770
actually run be snide London so if

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,509
you've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to this island it's</font>

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,558
like thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming there's a long</font>

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:36,030
way to come basically what I'm is

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:38,468
struggling today is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the ankle</font>

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,440
I've always been a big proponent at the

12
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:44,559
end points as a solution do defense and

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,459
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> instant response but also to</font>

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,730
actually be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I say get more</font>

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,280
information we've had a tendency oh now

16
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,909
in the past we've had a tendency to

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,530
focus on the exterior right number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

18
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,120
years probably will remember this you

19
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the defense in depth model</font>

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,710
we kind of dropped the defense in depth

21
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">block people started losing faith in in</font>

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,630
the end point technology that we were

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,940
actually deploying so this circle became

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,070
big on the outside we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on</font>

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,230
camera protecting the perimeter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">lost track of the inside and the problem</font>

27
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,220
is is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the</font>

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">attackers think the outside is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

29
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,360
wall just something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite that's what</font>

30
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,370
they're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,800
what's at the core your information

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,450
systems it's the critical assets

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,119
vigilant you used the users

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,009
people are using anything that's just

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,100
basically sitting on Amish my machine

36
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:43,939
whoever is you know the sober or whether

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:47,240
it's laptop welcome to desktop and you

38
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:49,639
know my paradigm is this right so do you

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys all know imagine online remember</font>

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,289
the Maginot Line okay imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,659
the French knocks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> French so I can</font>

42
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,210
basically say you know French and an

43
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,270
interesting idea but as usual no I never

44
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished it so basically by the time</font>

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,920
they actually got to it they built it it

46
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:09,709
was outdated technology Germans just run

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,110
over but this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first example if</font>

48
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,980
you think about it the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

49
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:19,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">a wall to keep that is to complete gogh</font>

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,500
so do you guys know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one is so</font>

51
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,060
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Haven walk it was the Romans</font>

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,099
built that between Scotland and England

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,440
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the funny thing is most people think</font>

54
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,390
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's defensive wall it wasn't it</font>

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,549
was a state as simple and that's what

56
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,660
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a lot of our criminal defense</font>

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">institutions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I thought however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font>

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this next-gen I with technology some</font>

60
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,870
way in front of my career far as the

61
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,000
primitive doesn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the funny</font>

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,090
thing is with

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hadrian's Wall is there when you think</font>

64
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,600
about it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they built it they build a</font>

65
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,850
state of simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't keep the Scots</font>

66
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,370
how all right the Scots still came into

67
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,700
the into it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roman Empire they</font>

68
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:00,880
had the adverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect the Scots came in</font>

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,380
they really pillaged inside the inside

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,990
England but they couldn't go back

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,970
because you know in those days the

72
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">ledger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy pulls big carriages full of</font>

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,410
stuff you can't get over the wall

74
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,330
without going for the game so instead of

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,340
actually letting stop if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come again</font>

76
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,580
they let people completely goober

<font color="#CCCCCC">they've stopped them from going out and</font>

certain extent we're not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

79
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,160
today in information security when it

would offer a min technology but we have

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,940
that same thing as people are getting in

82
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,050
and they're sitting and residing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,890
network technology we've got sent lots

91
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,920
keep up this the end point solutions are

92
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,690
seeing in the market today they're built

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,099
for the instant response type suspected

94
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,040
they were filled it up after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

incident right the bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> about training</font>

96
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,418
your forensics image training is Grant's

97
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,440
getting your forensics information and

98
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:21,969
we look at how suspicious loss we look

99
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,310
at acting you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look things are</font>

100
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:29,290
active in resolution to decide what's

101
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:31,780
going on and we kind of look at what's

102
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,090
changed but we're actually got looking

103
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,989
at what happened right so when we're

104
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,030
trying to get to understand how our

105
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment is compromised but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

106
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,260
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that snapshot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in time and</font>

107
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,110
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and feel the</font>

108
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,719
timing and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

109
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,250
this happened I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happened is</font>

110
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,550
happened and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is how they</font>

111
00:04:51,250 --> 00:05:01,300
got in and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the best shower or</font>

112
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:03,340
slow so the endpoint is actually can

113
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,950
actually provide the world of

114
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,530
information right so if you have if

115
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,750
you've ever done any basic research on

116

on an airplane this is windows example

118
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
you've got tools and even windows world

119
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,479
after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on windows well for this</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically to go to sysinternals just</font>

121
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">really much for this is TCP you so you</font>

122
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,080
can see every active cross<font color="#CCCCCC"> very active</font>

network connection that's going on

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,719
including

125
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,729
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low before us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last IP</font>

126
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:41,849
address in as you can get send and

127
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,839
receive both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> states and information</font>

128
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:46,049
then you've got process explorer

129
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,669
projects laura is really nice too

130
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,859
process explorer unlike<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task manager</font>

latching and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> locking details button</font>

132
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,539
up the process is doing and were held in

133
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:58,558
the hierarchy of processes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">snapshot there's actually a snapshot of</font>

dried eggs being run of Mize itself up

136
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:11,289
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start drilling down so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like command lines where it's</font>

139
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:21,399
widely from what the user is that can be

140
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:23,438
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any user you can get</font>

and inside inside the process so all the

144
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,119
information but this is my favorite room

145
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:43,300
so this is pokémon pokémon is very

146
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice and this is one of the problems</font>

147
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">with when you're looking at endpoint and</font>

148
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,550
looking at the technicals going on in

149
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,639
your time<font color="#CCCCCC"> at endpoint they start to</font>

150
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,739
generate organoids so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,479
snapshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> Explorer and everything but</font>

152
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:59,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">explorer is doing when you basically</font>

153
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,719
opening windows in explorer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see</font>

154
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:03,248
it's like creating farm an exploding an

155
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:06,159
image its clothing sparks reading the

156
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:07,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">side it's creating a registry it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carries</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a network if you</font>

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,930
actually do

159
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:16,469
look boomer shares are connected to a

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,880
network share<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing all this but the</font>

161
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting thing is it's giving you a</font>

162
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,719
lot of information is giving you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the process appears you can</font>

164
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,669
actually drill down into that education

165
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,919
about the processes involved the

166
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,159
operation you've got path rather

167
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,520
successful or not it's more details of

168
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,979
quiet since that's what was going on so

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,549
all this is information that when you

170
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,380
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually looking for incidents</font>

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,870
or actually looking for a power she's

172
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,370
been compromised if we have this kind of

173
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,970
information that should be able to see

174
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,430
the real time line how how for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

175
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:02,010
if itself is worth about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they drive</font>

176
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:04,440
by adam wells run dry by earth so with

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information we start to build an</font>

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,270
application female so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

179
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the best together and we can track</font>

180
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,299
number of events and say well if i see

181
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,539
multiple file writes and reads in the

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">sequence i can basically see say but the</font>

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">user or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is editing this</font>

184
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,120
file so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a file edit event</font>

185
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,310
or if I see things like far being

186
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,990
renamed from one directory to another I

187
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,849
can say well this is a far move

188
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:41,419
operation so you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give more</font>

context to the investor happy so well

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,699
well I'd like is to have ever listened

we're starting to see come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocket</font>

194
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,300
what the insert we're seeing is so

195
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,260
there's a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies including</font>

or where we're deploying saucy<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying</font>

are collecting all the state reporting a

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,980
pact that promised we start to get a

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level disability so you certainly</font>

201
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,740
can start to get all the file operations

202
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:23,860
or the network operations of HBO process

203

data some cement point agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

204
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,900
raise alerts and give you a map with the

207
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,120
overall what you're interested in is the

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can prob not every</font>

solution not everything with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene</font>

210
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,490
happens can be laid back to something

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's none yes it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other amount</font>

212
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,640
you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

213
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">smaller after show you want details some</font>

214
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,900
of these later but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can basically</font>

215
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,730
start pull out this information so you

216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">could detect when I'm gonna run an</font>

empire has been compromised so for

218
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,970
example page can start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see things</font>

219
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,620
like this is actually W strip and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog is</font>

220
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:14,350
good

221
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:16,570
internet now in I think 1997 every

reason w spirit go out onto the internet

224
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,880
there's no reason why Mugabe scoop

225
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,710
communicate to the internet so when

226
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,740
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for attacks or</font>

227
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,620
compromises this is key in detail and

228
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,170
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are see</font>

229
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,779
official employ two issues so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

230
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,870
raise this event and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">report back if you look into your sock</font>

232
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,010
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to build things</font>

233
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,719
more interesting same thing here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,510
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> stairs excelled in the network</font>

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,230
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> called members w shake copy</font>

237
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and then if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs are</font>

some funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their 20 numbers</font>

239
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,350
and divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pfc again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would Excel you</font>

240
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,490
can download exciting like that and

241
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,170
start to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

242
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,290
stop for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information for this time</font>

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,270
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see Beverly which has to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

swivel mechanism

246
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:25,399
this gets too fragmented power I think

247
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,988
frat party is going to be a new key

248
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:32,269
we're here everybody's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

249
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:36,410
the reality is is that you're basically

250
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:39,949
like this guy signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> player</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

that's interesting but you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

253
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:51,829
this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening it's</font>

254
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:55,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">a painful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long arduous task you're</font>

and you get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bored with us so in</font>

257
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:08,238
practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> fet hunting is an analyst</font>

258
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:11,480
versus an adversary it's essentially

259
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:13,429
intelligence but Jesus has somebody who

260
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,769
understands things knows what is looking

261
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:19,249
for and understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the adversary of</font>

00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:22,519
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> however so attacks it's about</font>

00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:25,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">being paid an adaptive because you might</font>

264
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,459
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're you know things but these</font>

265
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:30,378
guys probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more or they found</font>

266
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,049
ways of doing things you never before

267
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:35,509
but so need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be created you to</font>

268
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:38,559
actually think like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think sort so</font>

269
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:41,299
so you need to change your ways quickly

270
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,160
you're not looking for indicators and

271
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,689
that's the key thing is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

272
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,540
what i would think what we've been doing

00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:48,379
over the past few years in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this domain</font>

275
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,040
we're always being talked about

00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,959
indicators but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you</font>

277
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,998
some data where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">indicators all day you would have missed</font>

279
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:59,509
a piece of ransomware because they're

280
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:03,499
all the indicators point into groups and

281
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:06,230
green lights deep analysis potential

282
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:08,860
compromise resources when you think you

283
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,600
see something you have to go into

284
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,640
you have to go into and analyze

287
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,699
at every father I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about looking</font>

at Kevin proximo talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

every event one from the machine we're

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about looking at anything</font>

294
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,150
important part is as an analyst you have

295
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:43,000
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about understanding defining</font>

do you allow multiple users to connect

the alley what we had the case where we

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,000
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see manipulation of the</font>

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,770
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sieve an operation for</font>

346
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,680

the use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> any cats okay somebody's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to happen potentials what we</font>

349
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,650
eventually found out is that in fact it

350
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,380
was an internal person i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

were they were logging into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mansion</font>

365
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,260
but the key thing is basically

366
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,179
everything this goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tip it's the</font>

367
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,250
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do and then you can sit</font>

368
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,439
there and hold everything together but

369
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,449
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a sin you're not going</font>

370
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,350
to go big clock if you've ever played us

371
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:22,919
in actually got for me on Twitter that's

372
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:26,309
two weeks I've been going down qy puree

373
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,049
are not hell I'm trying to do some

374
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,090
reporting on some of this stuff and

375
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:34,889
curate off to build something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

376
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:37,379
way off is not an endpoint same solution

377
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay they do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint</font>

378
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have absolutely no fuel</font>

379
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,240
standpoint so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to port data</font>

380
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:54,530
for regenerating to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cure it q radar and</font>

381
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a 90 their system and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

382
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,178
half my day out so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing service</font>

383
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,280
wats I sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like back go out</font>

384
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,150
and that again it's like one much what

385
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,030
is this all this junk and I mean it's

386
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,610
sifting through gotten lots of data

387
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,889
right so there has to be a better way to

388
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,178
do this that's my conclusion I mean

389
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,789
we're pulling all of this information

390
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,770
and you add in more important

391
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,080
information but there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a better</font>

392
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,190
way to do it this is where I get back to

393
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,050
my file events and

394
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,690
and some of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking</font>

395
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,810
about earlier of understanding how

396
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:35,960
applications work<font color="#CCCCCC"> his engines start to</font>

397
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,840
build behavioral analysis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

398
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:47,360
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build logic you know you do if</font>

399
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:51,230
a plus B then C or D or E but not XYZ

400
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,080
can declare certain patterns so this

401
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,360
basically if i were to choke convert

402
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,490
this into something more beautiful so if

403
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:04,520
you use up into email WTF inside that

404
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:07,250
you know it launches acrobat and then

405
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,970
next step is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see demand for money</font>

406
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:16,430
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 or / acrobat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

407
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,800
almost certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Malaysian state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

408
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,180
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start to see manipulation with</font>

409
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,480
other types and regulations like

410
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,610
touching on data adding that use any

411
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,100
users to the admin accounts then I

412
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,570
definitely have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint that's risky</font>

413
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,570
or a network is compromised

414
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:40,730
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drill down a little bit</font>

415
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:43,909
into that so here we so basically how do

416
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,499
we behave built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into so when you open a</font>

417
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,470
file in outlook it actually creates a

418
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:51,590
temporary far so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a life step</font>

419
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:56,450
part of to a new location<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets him dead</font>

420
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:59,389
then write it up then copies it and it

421
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,850
opens up if you want to the process to

422
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:03,469
open the file so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

423
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,309
we start to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one let's</font>

424
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,869
catch this fun right so what we know

425
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:11,389
this file<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been saved from an email</font>

426
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:13,549
it's important because the user why you

427
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,408
should save the email file attachment

428
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:20,480
and open it later so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

raise this as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> event attachment open</font>

432
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,139

waives open an attachment that's come

off an email from there we see office

435
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,289
opening the microsoft system so there's

436
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,749
a number of holes of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> maid number of</font>

got to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> binary inside the file so</font>

452
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:28,620
that right out binary or the connector

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:33,490
and networking download<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we then see</font>

455
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,059
they do that because they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that any</font>

going on so then that binary Iver

an elevated risk from that point if we

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,510
track everything that's going on and

467
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,428
generate more devil why is this

468
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,129
important this<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about fret hunting</font>

470
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,460
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data if we start to add</font>

471
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,710
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end point data that we can</font>

472
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,710
generate it's going to be masters and a

473
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:26,019
today so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the data to a</font>

474
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,510
minimum until we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay when</font>

475
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:31,000
it becomes important we also want to get

476
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:36,279
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well I'm at the state let's</font>

477
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,370
notify the operators let's notify the

478
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,019
analyst let's treat them off so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

479
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,629
with this data back into my saw a

480
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinless day like I saw I can start to</font>

481
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,260
build dashboards<font color="#E5E5E5"> up trigger alarms and</font>

482
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,560
say we think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint has been</font>

483
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:56,760
compromised

484
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:58,679
oh so now this won't be too small so i

485
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,410
don't i'm actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm knocked it down</font>

486
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,480
to two because well if you want for

487
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:07,410
instance inks on this i can show you is

488
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:10,140
one really interesting one but with if

489
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:14,040
well one of our customers has a lot of

490
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">chinese contractors and they allow to</font>

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,010
dictionary to a new keyboard to say fine

494
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:34,409
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it learning into the office</font>

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:36,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">it lowers think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 56</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's one executable</font>

496
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,310
and then you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> seaward stop</font>

497
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,370
communicating up to IP addresses in

00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">china which is really interesting so</font>

499
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll call origin digital guardian is</font>

500
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,490
dead loss prevention so when you see

501
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that did i'm thinking okay I'm sitting</font>

502
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,990
here there's a guy going out to this all

503
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:58,679
these work processes basically can you

504
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:01,980
came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and forth between your bosses</font>

507
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,690
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like it's a dictionary and a</font>

508
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,920
keyboard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what you're</font>

509
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,810
telling me is but every time that

510
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,090
Chinese user<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice about what the English</font>

00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:13,889
Way is for report but he's writing he's

512
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,419
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> typing that word for typing</font>

513
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,760
that phrase into this tool or

514
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,830
highlighting it in half its and it's

515
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:27,360
being sent to China you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can imagine what</font>

516
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next response force I thought this</font>

517
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,000
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will show you to droid x so the</font>

518
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,280
alert so we things will be picked up try

519
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one show you this one and i'll show</font>

520
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,410
you ransom at the ransomware was

521
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,250
actually really interesting so there's

522
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,130
one of our customers and

523
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:49,960
they sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an email you're an</font>

524
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:58,010
interesting person so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> driving so</font>

525
00:24:49,960 --> 00:25:02,720
hopefully you can see so down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so</font>

526
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:04,430
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where basically we you know when</font>

527
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,320
i talked about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> look when you up an</font>

528
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,720
attachment this is where we've actually

529
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">generated a copy event and we see the</font>

530
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,230
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attachment we have more</font>

531
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">information as well our past and things</font>

532
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,200
like that then we see Excel making copy

533
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,450
of it so basically what happens is

534
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,250
outlook does that copy in one location

535
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:26,750
than itself but since it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> temporary</font>

536
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:29,210
one and this dll load is when we start

537
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:34,400
to see the macro subsystem thing pull

538
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that okay so then this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fun part</font>

539
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,890
we see Excel doing network connections

540
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,570
to the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for 81</font>

541
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">for any because most firewalls and</font>

542
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,520
proxies left for any go through you

543
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:53,719
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 86</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L this is the URL this is</font>

544
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:58,870
the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name remember the server up</font>

545
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,870
here at subjects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial connection</font>

546
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,739
yes so here's the actual URL because he

547
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,570
does the initial connection to open the

548
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,570
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connection when he's</font>

549
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,200
actually downloading the file once

550
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,629
you've downloaded file you write this

551
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,860
you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is running it it's actually</font>

552
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,560
running it in the tip<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they local</font>

553
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,350
that data so we've got multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

554
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,600
events now if the agents are told you

555
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,610
enough it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappear differentiate</font>

556
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,939
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> binary and an off binary</font>

557
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">file then it gets renamed and gets</font>

558
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,640
kicked off by itself so here we would

559
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">have parent information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could pull</font>

560
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,620
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles and provides whatever you</font>

561
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,379
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we see this basically going</font>

562
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,030
out this one is with interesting because

563
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,030
actually doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6p connections to spot me</font>

564
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:54,389
up 844 hey no surprise up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go</font>

565
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,430
through on some boxes the vendor

566
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:59,130
realized why is just because some people

567
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:02,190
just allow anything over a fast on the

568
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:06,290
foxes and files know a lot of websites

569
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,290
do that big E's<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

570
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,100
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a ransomware attack from</font>

571
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,630
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> April</font>

572
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,340
so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more detail this is the</font>

573
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,290
purpose sort of thing it's like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

574
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get as much detail</font>

575
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,310
as you want if you're doing the right

576
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,740
listening on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end point so here</font>

577
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,169
basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ransomware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse a zip</font>

578
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,630
file with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript attachment so</font>

579
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,890
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> original one I don't</font>

580
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual opening of the safe</font>

581
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,690
harbor this is where it starts with the

582
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,880
W script so here we see the command line

583
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,070
so simple command line is the users are

584
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,600
cooked in farm is it but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a path</font>

585
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,850
so we know what the original Star Wars

586
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,010
we don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it</font>

587
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,139
out and our forensics we have that fun

588
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,090
and if you notice the file name it ends

589
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,380
so the actual phishing attack was

590
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,090
actually quite cleverly done it was a

591
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,230
notice to appear in court we will

592
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,649
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a notice to appear in court</font>

593
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,480
facing do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you open because you know</font>

594
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,950
you could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> report so it says</font>

595
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,300
notice to appear it's about serial

596
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:12,090
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> as fjs most users don't have the</font>

597
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,250
file extension visible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

598
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Explorer so when the help in this AC doc</font>

599
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,050
oh my security guys for me I'm allowed

600
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,250
to open docx files it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay do we have</font>

601
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:24,780
protection on doc doc files so then this

602
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,290
script actually starts to read some

603
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:31,440
stuff then does a connection out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

604
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet so we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to capture IP</font>

605
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:50,680
addresses again and actually downloads

606
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:54,399
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have complicated so it's a</font>

607
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,460
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long URL basically this ransom is</font>

608
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,610
hiding an ad server and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed to</font>

609
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:04,990
compromise over and a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for</font>

610
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:08,199
registration information so then we see

611
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:16,480
basically loading some<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's to occur</font>

612
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it then flash first word so this</font>

613
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,500
one is this first hook into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

614
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:26,080
basically and I ran this each time it

615
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,020
was a different version same name but

616
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,370
the m5 changed every time it's

617
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:35,620
essentially just download anything so

618
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,080
does one of those when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does another</font>

619
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,560
level connection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he launched the</font>

620
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,560
second down

621
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,679
and the second downloader is actually

622
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:51,679
the one that's going to start doing

623
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,469
delicious stuff let me see it watching a

624
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,839
CMD now if you're smart and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the range is</font>

625
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:59,959
good you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture the actual command</font>

626
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:04,399
so here I actually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's adding</font>

627
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:06,889
a registry entry if the runs and he's

628
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,379
calling it cryptid and he's got a text

629
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:11,208
file so basically that's where he's

630
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:17,029
going to have when reboot I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

631
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:20,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a message so then he adds some doc</font>

632
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:24,019
cryptid and use it to them into the

633
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:26,418
class classes so where his extension for

634
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:32,289
m.tech that's recognizes in far time and

635
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:32,289
the pocket by the by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elkins notepad</font>

636
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,270
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's gone you have some</font>

637
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about decrypting cook did</font>

638
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,360
there's the registry so I'm actually

639
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:47,500
tracking a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail some sort command</font>

640
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:51,800
lines and electricity renting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

641
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:54,410
activating solar nails all right he's

642
00:30:51,800 --> 00:31:02,649
gone out<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so here's the interesting</font>

643
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:02,650
thing goes out and downloads esta leap

644
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:12,650
from live system tools com how many of

645
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you think that that</font>

646
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:20,720
would be flagged one anyways far away

647
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:25,310
anyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-gen network of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

648
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">debris it's green you know silence you</font>

649
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,940
know they consider have all this

650
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,040
financial technology has no effect send

651
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,120
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barstow it's green it says to</font>

652
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:37,820
leave is Microsoft then he starts is

653
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,360
bachelor and this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really</font>

654
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,139
beautiful he has a batch file<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

655
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,729
basically does a full command

656
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:50,270
recursively on every tribe learn

657
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:54,230
imaginable from B to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Z and he's looking</font>

658
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:57,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typical office file types well you</font>

659
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:01,010
know business<font color="#CCCCCC"> card types and then a</font>

660
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:03,590
puppy does that follow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever any</font>

661
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">pipes it into a fine strength to</font>

662
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,179
actually get rid of anything but see on

663
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:15,290
influence system and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

664
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:19,370
he's compiling a list of files that he

665
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:23,830
wants to encrypt event calls another

666
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,520
application is downloaded a zero dot exe

667
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,199
and

668
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you a command my flat in the</font>

669
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,900
middle so then he starts to do

670
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,800
ok this is a move

671
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,520
teach me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use Excel</font>

672
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:38,819
so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine just agree to do man</font>

673
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:41,129
like it's basically going a night when

674
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:52,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">say x cubed and then a negative five</font>

675
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:54,719
original yeah so this is McMahon mind is

676
00:34:52,018 --> 00:34:59,308
using ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> copied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a danger so</font>

677
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:02,848
it's a zero<font color="#E5E5E5"> by FC next problem is a then</font>

678
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:09,380
minus MX zero third- and engage then

679
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:12,630
minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> P whole five straight name file</font>

680
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:15,299
picked it and then five does anybody

681
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:24,119
know that Mara is when I saw is John

682
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:25,820
straight it's a really simple tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark</font>

683
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do</font>

684
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,850
it's seven sit there basically repackage

685
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:38,390
70 put in a few modifications to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick</font>

686
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the NT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five and is archiving interning</font>

687
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:45,830
Floyd encrypted the archiving process

688
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:50,030
through but<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P guess what good</font>

689
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,410
way how did you password so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

690
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,440
kind of things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do if you</font>

691
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:59,680
have intelligent endpoint feeding your

692
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,680
day or so that's it
