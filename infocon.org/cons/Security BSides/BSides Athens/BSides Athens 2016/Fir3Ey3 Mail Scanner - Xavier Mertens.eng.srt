00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,698
cases need practice because have a look

145
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,580
at a sweet like Microsoft Office you the

146

147
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,370
all the features so why not it never

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,909
mattered to 20 mph you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you power</font>

149
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:40,179
in holes usual this the macro just duper

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">super crouppen so that was published</font>

151
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:48,189
to contain yourself so i can use macros

152
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,890
or cross macro are obviously because if

153
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,990
you try to to be the matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the floor</font>

mistake you'll a sensitive issue

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,459
disagree so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> monster off skate and i</font>

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,410
will show you some water station that's

the kind of pretty dr. Kearns so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

162
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,689
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite easy because the</font>

script is split across media travel and

164
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,330
this one is easy if logical catenation

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,540
this piece of all the characters in in

166
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,980
demand that's quite easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it this</font>

167
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:35,319
one is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice we have a friction</font>

168
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,529
which will remove old underscore from

170
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,279
every day when you read this you see

good for computer is quite difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

174
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,900
this one is also interesting so we have

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,630
multiple forever again to go split<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

344
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,559
feature is it won't appear so the goal

345
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:55,970
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract water of thing submit the</font>

346
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:58,490
file to the VPI and it will give you

348
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:07,940
extract IOC's any of you the nice of you

349
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,320

353
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,809
so I structure my time Jenna meet the

354
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,928
hash and send the hospitality to see if

355
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:23,330
it's known what's the score at home but

356
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,250
I hadn't one more feature so what does

357
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the strip is extract my attacks</font>

360
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,100
it's useless to send texts to send gifts

361
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:42,110
files and so on so you just another just

362
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:45,139
juice there are checks or does submit to

363
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,240
move it so at first I check the hash if

364
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:50,418
it's not existing I just invaded about
