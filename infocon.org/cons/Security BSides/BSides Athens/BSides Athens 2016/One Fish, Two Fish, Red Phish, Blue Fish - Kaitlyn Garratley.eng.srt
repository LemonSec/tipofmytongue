00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,630
for people to attend besides Athens this

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,450
year I really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there and</font>

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforce like this could not be helped</font>

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,460
the talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one fish two fish red fish</font>

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400
blue fish it's mainly a record of kind

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,660
kind of the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> forced I guess</font>

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,390
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduction to me my name is</font>

19
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,110
to converse is quite often a threat

00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,349
one thing that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of remain clear to</font>

me throughout all<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years that my</font>

will be how to make security easy for

people to understand and kind of how

they can rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves upon instead</font>

00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:54,599
keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in mind this talk my hope</font>

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,250
is to discuss the issue of fishing and

41
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,920
to try and understand and show it from

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other side this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will involve the</font>

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,739
research techniques carried out by other

44
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,580
people as well as ways in which people

45
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:09,009
aim to combat fishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether after</font>

46
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">briefly looking at this I will look into</font>

47
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,540
my own dissertation and at the points

48
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,819
that worked as well as those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,179
kind of really didn't and then lastly my

50
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:21,310
plan is look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future and how not</font>

51
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">only just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my research about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how everyone</font>

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,270
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change little bits and</font>

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:31,630
obvious steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:33,640
taken so i plan to look into those<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

55
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,560
so most people especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> those probably</font>

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this talk have at least a</font>

57
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,440
simple understanding of phishing attacks

58
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,450
however for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the anti-phishing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,250
group has a clear definition that sums

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,750
everything together and takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> away the</font>

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,970
ifs and buts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they all die and here</font>

62
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,800
in there so fishing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a criminal</font>

63
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,810
mechanism employing both social

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,150
engineering and technical subterfuge to

65
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:01,300
steal customers personally identity data

66
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:03,280
and financial like a potentials so for

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,120
anyone that has been any time looking

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,220
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing whether it's researching it</font>

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,739
reaching researching either side so<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

70
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,350
anything into the numbers or kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:18,000
just on the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's clear why it's an</font>

72
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:22,390
issue the numbers related to it are

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,890
absolutely staggering so phishing scams

74
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,660
make up<font color="#E5E5E5"> over eighty percent of the</font>

75
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,700
emails coming into accounts every day so

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not your inbox that's just emails</font>

77
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,829
going into an account and with this at

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty eight percent of the</font>

79
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,850
working day<font color="#CCCCCC"> is spent dealing with emails</font>

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,269
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mckinsey global institute</font>

81
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:46,989
so that's responding in any way so

82
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:53,470
that's replying reading kind of looking

83
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">at then the total number of unique</font>

84
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,630

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:21,750
captured this breaks<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to two hundred</font>

so with numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> this high it's no</font>

91
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,909
surprise that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2005 alone they meant</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US that gave their</font>

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,950
fraudulent email was over<font color="#CCCCCC"> two million</font>

95
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,919
this costs directly 1.2 billion dollars

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,430
to kind of put it in for kind of our

97

local no my local economy get safe

99
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:05,900
in 2015 which resulted in a cost of 174

100
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:11,990
million pound over the space of a year

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:14,630
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> British consumers and then with that</font>

102
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,950
the average 10,000 employee company

103

spends 3.7 million pound a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font>

104
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,760
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> phishing attacks on the backlash so</font>

105
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,000
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just numbers relating to</font>

106
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">real life statistics when research</font>

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,410
figures are inputted as well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

108
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:40,580
scary to see how little people really do

109
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:42,830
understand so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look more into</font>

110
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,710
various research methods but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

111
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,960
just kind of food for thought

112
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventy-two percent of 921 people</font>

113
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,169
clicked and follow the link when they

114
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,479
appeared from a friend so this was a

115
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,610
test group that had been told they were

116
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,170
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> tested they were fully aware that</font>

117
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were looking for phishing scams and</font>

118
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:08,600
they still clicked so kind of the real

119
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:13,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">question I guess is well why does it</font>

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,050
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I was always the same I every</font>

121
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,750
technical person I spoke to have been

122
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,690
well how can people be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stupid but</font>

123
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,670
fishing works exceptionally well it

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,510
isn't especially difficult to carry out

125
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,040
and can reap a massive benefits it

126
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,200
relies on different factors all playing

127
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,300
together to get the required result I'm

128
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,870
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the details and</font>

129
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,460
emails that make people click or the

130
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,630
techniques into cloning to make them

131
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">look real there</font>

132
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,340
talk is kind of based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the trust</font>

133
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:46,400
people have so it's instead it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will look</font>

134
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,719
at even not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons why people</font>

135
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,390
click but yeah I supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to why it</font>

136
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,390
happens and multiple researchers and

137
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,270
papers have found that where people know

138
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,180
a phishing attacks are or spam emails

139
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,039
are they they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about them the</font>

140
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,630
common misconception<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that they won't</font>

141
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,780
fall prey<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they don't have</font>

142
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything worth stealing or they believe</font>

143
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,390

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:19,370
steal or more to take it's easy for us

145
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to follow the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's happening</font>

146
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's easy for us to know at least a</font>

147
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,270
little about computers to say phishing

148
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,849
emails are so common surely people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

149
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,159
well unfortunately people really don't

150
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,500
for the vast part people accept that

151
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,380
their spam filter will protect them from

152
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,270
all levels of emails and every site

153
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,210
online is secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> because otherwise why</font>

154
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,740
would it be allowed to be online fishing

155
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,890
is something that most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are aware</font>

156
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,930
of whether it be simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge that</font>

157
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,280
they shouldn't click<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emails in their</font>

158
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:55,760
spam box or two people writing their own

159
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,039
filters or rules the issue is like most

160
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,050
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that no one believes</font>

161
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,530
it's going to happen until it happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

162
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,300
them with such high numbers relating<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

163
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,489
fishing it's clear why so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,610
choose as their research topic the

165
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,020
research people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do tends to go two ways</font>

166
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,930
protect people from and remove phishing

167
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,719
attacks completely and into the

168
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,090
techniques and to carrying out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,310
successful attack for this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

170
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">for my kind of papers and my just my</font>

171
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">dissertation I looked into the papers</font>

172
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:32,709
relating to preventing and protecting I

173
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:36,650
had no real interest in the making<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

174
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:38,780
malware and phishing attacks so this

175
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,030
research kind of breaks down into two

176
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,159
ways and the common themes i find

177
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,660
welcome to the papers was taking two

178
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,870
groups in seeing their reactions to

179
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">different emails and scenarios and then</font>

180
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,470
also developing training school tools

181
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,880
such as

182
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:58,760
games and apps to teach people<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

183
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,810
fishing taking the first group<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's has</font>

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:06,380
the obvious flaw in that to test someone

185
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:10,699
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally have to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they're</font>

186
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,250
being tested and so the common test is

187
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,720
to tell one group and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> train one group</font>

188
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,000
that looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for phishing attacks and</font>

189
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,950
tell the other one give them no training

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,260
and just kind of asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep an</font>

191
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,400
eye out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that might happen</font>

192
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,280
surely the issue that's clear to me is

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,199
clear to everyone and you're still

194
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,120
telling them you're going to be testing

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,900
them heightening someone's responses

196
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,330
lowers the accuracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second common</font>

197
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,390
technique usually involves a lot more

198
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">training so developing a method to</font>

199
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:43,100
naturally develop people's knowledge on

200
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,849
fishing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would expect so many</font>

201
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,600
researchers researchers and people have

202
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,430
attempted to perfect this it's such a

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,310
broad topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fully go into but there</font>

204
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,630
are some amazing papers and

205
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,839
documentation on the different training

206
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,060
people have developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of using</font>

207
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,090
games and different interactive methods

208
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,839
has exploded in recent years it has

209
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">shown how when you engage people a lot</font>

210
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:20,000
more information seems to stick when

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're ash asked about it later so I</font>

suppose spam filters the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> save and</font>

them fully one hundred percent they

don't know how they work or even really

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,050
what they do and every email provider

217
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:43,220
swears by theirs and you have to

218
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,410
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they get rid of so many</font>

fishing ones so with pop-up screen

229
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,680
from just about every site we visit

230

add-ons and browser extensions are

231
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,890
becoming an obvious thing to use for

242
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,390

truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe it would affect them</font>

244
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,840
it's the mentality of believing you're

safe because you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never been robbed</font>

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> approach my</font>

255
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,699
fourth year project I was pretty lost

256
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,950
and I was for a while not having

257
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,810
personally been affected by fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

258
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,390
all probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like most people listening</font>

259
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,380
I had no idea what made people fall for

260
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:38,480
attacks or what<font color="#E5E5E5"> or kind of why anyone</font>

261
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,950
would almost be that stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose</font>

262
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,700
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of the key reason I</font>

263
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,790
chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject the research I went</font>

264
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,370
into was kind of what I did him it

265
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,230
looked a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> training</font>

266
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,450
techniques and how they had failed and

267
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,190
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that different things</font>

268
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can be taken from each one and kind</font>

269
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:04,540
of merged together and my research

270
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,280
showed me that in many ways people

271
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,730
really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't understand more than</font>

272
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,459
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and the things that tried</font>

273
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,560
to fix it such as toolbars and pop-ups

274
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,270
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of scared them and so</font>

275
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,709
what people are told<font color="#E5E5E5"> about pop-ups is to</font>

276
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,579
leave them there probably malware don't

277
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,430
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them</font>

278
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,590
the presumption so the thing they're all

279
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,530
bad everything led to trying to help

280
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,740
people understand and knew what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

281
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of happening with their information the</font>

282
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:38,090
idea developed from looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what</font>

283
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:43,449
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so there was no kind of point</font>

284
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,880
in me doing a firefox on<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux because</font>

285
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,770
people use windows and cruel so i

286
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,280
decided i was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a tool that</font>

287
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:55,520
worked by acting as an absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter</font>

288
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,670
that the user would have full control

289
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,410
they would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have full</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control the</font>

290
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,979
purpose was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ensure someone could live</font>

291
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,240
with and understand fishing it might it

292
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,950
might be there and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not be able</font>

293
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get rid of it but they need to</font>

294
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand it doesn't have to affect</font>

295
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:19,040
them so for me the tool split quite

296
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,740
nicely into three sections aim<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

297
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,209
first section sign up was kind of just

298
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like every other application out there</font>

299
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:31,100
and you sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the services kind of</font>

300
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,660
type thing and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was made with an</font>

301
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,660
email address a phone number and a

302
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,390
password so unique codes were sent to

303
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,730
both the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the phone number you</font>

304
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,310
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them link in your account you</font>

305
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">would then generate a password that i</font>

306
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,500
had to be 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> characters long and it was</font>

307
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,260
then secured in a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standard way</font>

308
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,080
so it made use of kind of how you'd

309
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,620
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start standard two-factor</font>

310
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,000
authentication to use so then once you

311
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,880
were all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of signed up and it was</font>

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,440
installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the machine in the browser</font>

313
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,600
you would kind of then give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

314
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,510
permission to monitor your browser this

315
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:14,900
is where kind of kind of the tricky bit

316
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,700
came in really because to monitor

317
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,199
arouser you kind of have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

318
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trust the fact you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not just going</font>

319
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure everything you type so to do</font>

320
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:27,230
this and ensure it was done in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secured</font>

321
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">way I used a pre-written tool this was a</font>

322
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,070
widely available<font color="#CCCCCC"> on chrome too and has</font>

323
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,640
been for years it was called<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

324
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,880
buddy

325
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,030
it was used as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's such it has</font>

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,630
straightforward user input and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested</font>

327
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:45,630
a good few different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of browser</font>

328
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,300
monitoring tools to see for the exports

329
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,660
and for user input and this one I was

330
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,870
able to generate the browser history and

331
00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:00,089
export it in a text list to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

332
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,620
easily added to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter so the filter</font>

333
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,480
was then generated and continuously

334
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,660
updated to have the latest browser

335
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,180
session involved so the list they

336
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,880
installed all the sites visited it

337
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,390
deleted duplicates and then moved the

338
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:18,390
order to see regular visits and what

339
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:21,420
people what people expect its kind of to

340
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,770
use the most the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> can then go</font>

341
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,719
through delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> modify and change</font>

342
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things depending on the amount</font>

343
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,160
of emails they kind of require or want

344
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,390
and if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want no emails from a site</font>

345
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,730
that they happen to go on they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just move</font>

346
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,069
it into a blacklist where this will

347
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,210
overwrite the whitelist and stop emails

348
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:41,400
from coming in all together so the

349
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,570
filters were then applied to directly to

350
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,459
the email account this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done through</font>

351
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> settings it's quite a simple process</font>

352
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,500
you once you've applied the filter you

353
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:52,110
just declare that it would be the only

354
00:16:49,500 --> 00:17:00,470
filter allowed so the only males that

355
00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:02,640
can come in are those on this list so

356
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of keep it as</font>

357
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,410
simple as possible for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user so the</font>

358
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,560
tool worked in terms of filtering the

359
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,350
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> and monitoring browser usage the</font>

360
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,980
only emails coming through were those on

361
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,599
the whitelist and if something had been

362
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">placed on the blacklist it wouldn't</font>

363
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,050
appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested on one of my own</font>

364
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">accounts so that I knew there were</font>

365
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,760
definitely emails kind of going in and

366
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:30,239
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the account and it worked there</font>

367
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,690
was I didn't have kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned off</font>

368
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,850
my other filters and I had probably what

369
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,160
I'd expect in span wise I didn't have

370
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:44,760
that I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any from sites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

371
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,260
in it accessed however in my eyes

372
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,410
it was about getting a balance between

373
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,680
user experience and giving them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball</font>

374
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:58,170
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of understand what's</font>

375
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:00,210
going on so the functionality worked and

376
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,900
it depends completely on what someone

377
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,680
was expecting from the tool itself

378
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,510
everyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to read into the</font>

379
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">dissertation the paper differently but</font>

380
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:15,540
on one hand the tool needed the user to

381
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:18,510
manually do each step otherwise it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

382
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,940
just another application that wouldn't

383
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">help anyone to build knowledge and it</font>

384
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,100
was just running in the background and

385
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,770
then you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it for</font>

386
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,050
another side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the spectrum technology</font>

387
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,879
is about making life easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

388
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:44,010
accessible so why wouldn't that be the

389
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:46,260
right way to do it so I supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

390
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,910
of decide and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really decide but kind</font>

391
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of come up with a kind of conclusion for</font>

392
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:55,260
my situation I had to break it down

393
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:59,700
pretty much into good versus bad and so

394
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email filtered correctly and the</font>

395
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,000
user knew exactly what was going on

396
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,770
because they did each debt themselves

397
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,110
they knew where all the pieces came

398
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">together it was a simple process that</font>

399
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:14,250
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just followed so we all take our</font>

400
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,010
computer computing knowledge for granted

401
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and for granted sorry and even the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

402
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,390
educated<font color="#E5E5E5"> person can be completely</font>

403
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,940
oblivious to anything to do with

404
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:28,980
computers so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the with this</font>

405
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,600
technique the user kind of gains their

406
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,610
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands-on it's not about me</font>

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,080
telling someone oh this is how you'd

408
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,719
find it this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how an email</font>

409
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,820
filter works it's them doing it and then

410
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:45,030
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process to do it</font>

411
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:46,800
themselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you've kind of got</font>

412
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,370
to look at the complete flip side where

413
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,399
the tool wasn't seamless and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

414
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:56,550
made it less likely for people to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

415
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,620
every year phones tablets and computers

416
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:01,580
are all being developed

417
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,780
make people's life easier to be done

418
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,730
quicker and because when we want things

419
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:11,280
done we want them done now we're not

420
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:15,390
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ritter's like you me</font>

421
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,770
people actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in into computers</font>

422
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,450
and into the knowledge behind them

423
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,710
they're quite happy sitting running a

424
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,230
scan and they're quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy sitting</font>

425
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,620
checking settings just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make sure</font>

426
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are okay and running correctly</font>

427
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,000
regular kind of people not take people

428
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:33,480
why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I even consider these things</font>

429
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,160
and then when pop-ups happen to tell

430
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,420
them these things are happening they

431
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,380
don't trust pop-ups they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been told</font>

432
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,150
not to trust pop-ups technology is just

433
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a dangerous circle I continuously goes</font>

434
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:51,170
round and round so in my eyes the tool

435
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:53,309
wasn't seamless enough and it might just

436
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,100
encourage people to be complacent and

437
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,720
they do it that one time and then they'd

438
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,000
never update the filter that never

439
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,090
update the database and finding that

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">balance of where it does that itself and</font>

441
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:14,639
where a user has to do it was very

442
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:18,150
difficult it's so kind of my what now

443
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,550
type slide I suppose and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

444
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,650
doing multiple different slides on where

445
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,800
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not see the future going but</font>

446
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:28,250
feel where we could go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future and</font>

447
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:33,360
what kind of could happen I just did one

448
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:36,600
so in the nicest<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be as an</font>

449
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,229
industry less ignorant to people not

450
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,570
every plot people as in cultures and and

451
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,520
things like that what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in just</font>

452
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of different knowledge levels in</font>

453
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,129
computing it's the same same way that we

454
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">can tell all this piece of malware it</font>

455
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,679
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this from a computer it's</font>

456
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,300
the same premise in any profession being

457
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,570
told what is wrong with you before

458
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,370
you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the x-ray or a mechanic</font>

459
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,580
knowing what is wrong wrong with the car

460
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:09,178
by the side of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engine it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

461
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,850
the understanding we build and we

462
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,659
develop both kind of through hard work

463
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,959
and naturally

464
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:18,450
I suppose there needs to be a new way to

465
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,479
teach people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from early on how to be</font>

466
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,470
secure if we can justify teaching

467
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:30,479
programming and developing two children

468
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:32,509
in primary schools surely we can teach

469
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:35,909
them to develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong way to be safe</font>

470
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:40,320
there are apps for everything these days

471
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:42,840
and if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a fun interactive</font>

472
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,999
way that can naturally develop and

473
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,709
progress through a child's life to be to

474
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:52,019
make them secure and to make them know

475
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,789
what security is surely we should be

476
00:22:52,019 --> 00:23:00,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">using that obviously teaching kids is</font>

477
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:01,440
one thing but then for adults that kind

478
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of needs to be an interactive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

479
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,349
learn as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's we need to step away</font>

480
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,129
from the let's go in a corporate

481
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:12,869
training day and just kind of give them

482
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:16,498
a one-off training people need to be

483
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:20,340
taught not to be complacent and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

484
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:22,379
not to expect these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to happen</font>

485
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,658
they need to kind of take it all into

486
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:28,259
their own knowledge and know-how to go

487
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:31,139
into their own way of doing it this is

488
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:35,599
where for I for me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus needs to be</font>

489
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:38,399
so computing is so easy we all know that

490
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:43,559
it's just teaching people and showing

491
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:45,178
people how easy it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be my idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was to</font>

492
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:50,820
develop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplest way possible to</font>

493
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:54,269
teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I think that even the</font>

494
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,710
step I<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly missed out on was asking</font>

495
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,299
people how they'd find it helpful

496
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,679
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just assuming they need a</font>

497
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,349
training course and assuming it's their

498
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:05,070
own responsibility yes it's probably the

499
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:06,210
responsibility but we expect a doctor to

500
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,928
tell us why we're sick without

501
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:12,809
patronising us surely it's time every

502
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:22,619
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry especially our one learns</font>

503
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:25,428
to do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so kind of last kind</font>

504
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the last thing before I finish and</font>

505
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,440
because

506
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:33,000
you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed I love numbers</font>

507
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,830
and if there ever is a time to teach

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,559
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look after themselves surely</font>

509
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:41,460
it's now so when I did this research it

510
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:45,149
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of April in 2016 there</font>

511
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,270
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just under three and a half billion</font>

512
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,809
people using the internet across the

513
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:57,049
world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-six percent of the</font>

514
00:24:51,809 --> 00:25:02,428
world's population was online with that

515
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:05,010
up between us all both legitimate and

516
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:09,650
spam emails two million emails are sent

517
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:12,200
a second surely it's about time we

518
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped just throwing thousands</font>

519
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,289
thousands of papers at it and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

520
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:23,189
come together and think of any way to

521
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:24,929
keep people<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe so thank you for</font>

522
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,299
listening and I suppose watching because

523
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:30,929
it's a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my twitter handle is on</font>

524
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:33,139
screen it is at Caitlyn<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4495 feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

525
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to message me and I can give everyone</font>

526
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,909
the references<font color="#CCCCCC"> and figures for kind of</font>

527
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,350
everything above and things like that

528
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I suppose kind of answer any</font>

529
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:43,320
questions you might have because

530
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:46,168
obviously I'm not there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer them</font>

531
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,470
and once again thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much for</font>

532
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:51,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">listening and I hope the conference is</font>

533
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,590
brilliant and I know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be so have</font>

534
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,590
a nice day<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
