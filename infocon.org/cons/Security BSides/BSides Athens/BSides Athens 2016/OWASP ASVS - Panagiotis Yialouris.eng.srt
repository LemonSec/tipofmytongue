00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:28,980
this part a secret keys still in order

38
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:33,000

it's interviews and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a heavy heavy</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sauce for the execution there is a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">proper interstates are day as we said</font>

they're here a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> complex regulation</font>

306
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,139
and the complex roots of light in the

is a true performer but they might have

<font color="#E5E5E5">and has quite a special focus on that is</font>

the use case diagrams and a

classical ones diagram so we need to

321
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,519
have your days in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

classes designed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the season and they</font>

take this head two steps a as I'm

project in a poorly Tate Modern also

328
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:57,678
it's a good practice to go through

329
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:01,799
coding standards and practices of life a

330
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,799
this is Admiral day discussing rare and

you may from this scenario and mopping

341
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,399
actually it is very important to go

342
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:43,049
through the rugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guidelines</font>

of the technology start and involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

345
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:56,730
the project so if you go through a

346
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,610
people to the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the project and it</font>

347
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,600
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font>

very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good choice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for her step and</font>

349
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,699
collect all the necessary party

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,670
libraries and dependencies of the

is apart from an ability for hun and

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we said it's a it's also good</font>

356
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:32,280
practice to utilize the static analysis

357
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,799
tools available across the Baltic and

358
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,379
this is it will be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

359
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">asus so what we say to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get their</font>

then<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start to we can start to</font>

362
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:55,080
utilize a diagram as a representative

were the were the healthy pursuit start

366
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:08,040
a review and finally as many projects

367
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:11,370
like that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite complex it in terms</font>

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,980
of business<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality it's a</font>

369
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:18,840
good practice practice to prioritize the

<font color="#CCCCCC">DFT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bowl and paradise l4d2</font>

371
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,209
complexity and just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font>

372
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,419
you have

373
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:29,620
mental and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entrance in the project</font>

374
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:34,330
and would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with some</font>

375
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:40,360
more more feasible and more more simply

376
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:42,460
a cases and to review this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this</font>

377
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,879
is also important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you probably</font>

378
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be probably working with a</font>

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,030
different teacher of development for

380
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,639
example some teams will do the front end

00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,850
some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other game and will be</font>

382
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,090
responsible for the back end so it's say

383
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:00,790
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were here in words a more than</font>

384
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:06,610
more than one person to person to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

utilize data then in development

<font color="#E5E5E5">summary is able to using the navigation</font>

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,240
identify critical relationship stuff to

the kind of all that you have to do you

00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:01,920
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an important part of the</font>

anything that is not very like a

reporter and it does not beat meet the

433
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,750

compute on that and say that the ages

through as to the source code review was

a very recent testing activities a re y

454
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,850
and then most of the controls

455

a of the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 are no penetration</font>

testing artifacts also the security

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,480
combination can provide a useful

detective of a model another day another

with the confusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that the project</font>

462
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:28,080
will start a and it is a good practice

463
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:32,699
to deliver sense of the given a notice

my issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> plausibly development team in</font>

465
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,940
order to perform scoring rate and to

466
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,480
support your leg can you let me get

<font color="#CCCCCC">another position since I you would be</font>

learning even more the system brought

469
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,970
the project and the first of the

470
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:55,290
security is better and easier when

471
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:58,020
integrated in every begin manner this is

472
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:01,649
mostly related to 11 30 phase yes

473
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,139
because this is a level 3 requires very

<font color="#E5E5E5">with a passive and ready to take garage</font>

476

considered before hand during the design

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,380
and

481
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:25,620
requirements pace of development so this

00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it</font>
