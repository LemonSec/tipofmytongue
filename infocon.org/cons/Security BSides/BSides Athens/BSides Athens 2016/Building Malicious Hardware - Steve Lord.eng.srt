00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well there's lots of things you can</font>

144
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,170
do you can go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take his bankbook</font>

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,200
apart we can go and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do something</font>

146
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,720
to some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tips on there do</font>

147
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,550
something cool or we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> install a UEFI</font>

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,020
binary that will have keylogger on<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

149
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can reconfigure it so that</font>

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,450
on power saving or loose and we kind of

153
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,859
thought if we open up a macbook<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

154
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:11,390
breaks it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good practical joke</font>

155
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,880
today we<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw widely go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out with some</font>

156
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,010
malware on the device you know and then

157
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,960
that way wherever he goes what we can do

158
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,810
can just have it randomly do<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to</font>

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,489
switch off and again if we kind of screw

160
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,760
that up that's not really a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> painted</font>

161
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,630
him so again we decided to go and look

162
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,150
up wake on LAN so wake on LAN is a very

163
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,210
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol and somehow despite</font>

164
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,120
there being a standard very much people

165
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,680
don't dare to it so poor you how do you

166
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,180
have the concepts of something called

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,070
amounting packing and there's wake

168
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,990
online link on wireless LAN and various

181
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,700
there's nothing to make particularly

182
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,060
spectacular to it but I just thought

183
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,930
well I had another<font color="#CCCCCC"> window with me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

184
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,930
had this little CC three thousand Texas

185
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,610
Instrument Wi-Fi breakout and I thought

186
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,620
it would just be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> excuse to use</font>

187
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,080
that apparent

188
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,589
if we don't start sending way more lab

189
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,429
requests tomorrow after work then

190
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:37,930
obviously it would die three for Tommy

191
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,169
so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make something like this you need</font>

192
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,449
an Arduino Uno you can use a nano you

193
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,890
can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that Belgian but I will</font>

194
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,380
probably go to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

195
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,620
from scratch people to use Mallory dunno

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's going to using an Arduino I would</font>

197
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,589
if I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to redo this i would use</font>

198
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,810
an esp8266 check<font color="#E5E5E5"> the white one way but</font>

199
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:02,740
you can get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino uno</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home for</font>

200
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,800
about ten euros and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticc 3000 jail</font>

201
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,410
because when it comes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino every</font>

202
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,939
device that you add on to it has its own

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,420
set of libraries in its own way of doing

204
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,430
things and Scott always the same that's

205
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,990
about thirty five euro said the which is

206

<font color="#E5E5E5">why don't we do this again since</font>

you've never used our beer before it's

basically uses a<font color="#CCCCCC"> superset C to kind of</font>

217
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,279
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a bit more friendly and there</font>

218
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,380
are two<font color="#E5E5E5"> main functions that is the setup</font>

configure your hardware you'll get to

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
Walley doing that and then there's a

222
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">loop function which are supposed to be</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps actually more teeth and a tutor</font>

226
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,880
me Walter there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> already volatile</font>

227
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,400
to talk to some of this stuff so what we

228
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,960
have here is we have lousy<font color="#E5E5E5"> pens on the</font>

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:30,410
top and we set up the pins for shield

230
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,240
and then when we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> V they carbon</font>

231
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,410
Wi-Fi network password which is prepared

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,960
and the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> time in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setup part</font>

233
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,800
or to do is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCP thousand is designed</font>

234
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,720

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,710
well on the details<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tasty Furcal</font>

238
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,199
restart the device connects to the

239
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,640
network which is a common<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pattern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

240
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,160
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that we're going to</font>

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,170
I think thanks to Wi-Fi network and then

243
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,270
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop function because I really</font>

you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward</font>

status socket functions or anything like

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:41,000
that and then we connect we book market

254
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:43,670
we send it so far so good right so very

that's what stays awake he comes home

flat was dead we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a little</font>

259

chuckle and then we tell them how

are we actually kind of expected come on

261

265

the day before I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> heading back to the</font>

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,500
weeks later and stay over dance again

268
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,860
the week after I left well have a family

269

emergency that's correct the UK and darn

270
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,930
I sort of didn't really see each other

271

<font color="#E5E5E5">for about six months in the meantime</font>

this thing was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off in dark lap</font>

273
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:45,180
keeping that macbook awake so what

<font color="#CCCCCC">happened well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to the apple store</font>

dying on me the apple store took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font>

277
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,709
and they said we can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

278
00:12:54,459 --> 00:13:06,369
with it sinn fein in so far my<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunk and</font>

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,870
quite expensive anything falls to the

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:22,230
worst rail networks in Europe so mark

302

nice day and it was fun so six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

316
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,250
Don flipping so some lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from</font>

this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing first of all the CC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 33</font>

318
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,900
a few thousand series models are really

319
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,530
expensive it's not worth leaving them

320
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,329
somewhere for six months second if

321
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,589
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of normal kind of</font>

322
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,420
thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess we could learn from all of</font>

323
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,690
this which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,729
sort of you know malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stoker and if</font>

325
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,050
only I'd actually implemented some sort

326
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,820
command and control<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could have shot</font>

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:48,839
this over<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in the bay so that's</font>

336
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,949
two people from stock photos<font color="#E5E5E5"> postal</font>

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,700
they live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this apartment blocking</font>

339
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,800
cake turn their evil Newman's and they

340
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,760
have really really really crappy

341
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,199
upstairs neighbors and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,790
fight over there at the Gotham a

00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,600
girlfriend chatter<font color="#CCCCCC"> they and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

344
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,890
they were chatting about eight o'clock

345
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,570
in the evening they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being</font>

346
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:36,100
particularly loud or anything just chill

347
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,470
now and the upstairs neighbors started

348
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,810
shouting from the balcony from inside

349
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:46,050
their apartment with those open and he's

350
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:48,640
been tuned<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the guy it is the man and</font>

351
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:51,339
repeating this in kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird</font>

352
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,020
and sinister way so what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> make fire</font>

353
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,180
there I flowing from the stand by the

354
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,540
time I landed that they can find all

355
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,430
kinds of stuff going on so you know

356
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,610
these are the takeaways of what we can

357
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,800
learn from Eddie's neighbors about any

358
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,349
that he is the Duke de Lima man and then

359
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:13,290
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> beaten so I'm excited to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font>

360
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">or ok so how do you with these guys</font>

361
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,060
option would be because that applies

362
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,770
their army is to go write some code to

363
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore connecting to the names</font>

365
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:30,190
remembered<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm come back from New</font>

about the table the Thunder blame that I

368
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,660
girl so a funder blade is basically just

369
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,820
a rough ride with good lighting code

370
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,760
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically be your face on</font>

373
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,540
things getting an afternoon and the

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,510
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing was a particular hipster s</font>

the other hand it's super diva queen but

384
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:26,560
obviously not as proof of<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">analysis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is candy and I as evidenced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

386
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,510
the fact I did rice and even really work

387
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,490
very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> such as cute shoutouts where</font>

388
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,500
we play so if I thought I can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

389
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,570
Thunder thing and just have it so that

390
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,510
instead of listening for requests it

391
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,790
just looks at whoever's on on Josh

392
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,129
network upstairs and feels anyone okay

393
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:49,470
but then adds any Ramadi mean either

394
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:53,440
face that's too pretty for jail so

395
00:18:49,470 --> 00:19:02,190
instead I said when we build a device

396
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:06,730
which are not at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

397
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:10,330
Eddie's neighbors are and what I used

398
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:16,120
was I used this which is a known NC you

399
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:21,340
Tomas yes be 8286 SL net cost about a

400
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,870
euro to two euros the chip which is

401
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,080
point one well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit basic</font>

402
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:30,040
variable called the SP 15 euros per<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

403
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,939
Nancy you and just go programming the

404
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:39,820
arduino ide and<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak adventure at night</font>

405
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:43,720
so all comes out quite clearly crank or

406
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing on to 11 and the process that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

407
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,260
decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use was to abuse some of the</font>

408
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">L some of the functionality ESP to</font>

409
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,050
algorithm to generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSIDs consisting</font>

410
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,720
of Jeff's a man do for carly plus an ID

411
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,180
has chosen rather the two digit ID and

412
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,180
broadcast of every 250 milliseconds

413
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,580
because while obviously doing something

414
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,580
malicious will be bad like the offing

415
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,730
people just insulting the globe Wi-Fi

416
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,730
SSID

417
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:25,590
so I'm gonna go switch this thing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

418
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:28,399
if you go my friend should the Democrats

Clayton going from the antenna to your

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,428
things that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have the full</font>

expansions you do you take a d/s 1307

566
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,590
real time clock people fun things of the

568
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:48,418
because it's also is known but certainly

569
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:50,639
on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the ar-15 having a</font>

real sauce on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows you</font>

572
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:59,129
this to stream gsm decodes over to a

573
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:01,260
more powerful system to go make do

574
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:08,460
something like cracking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine one if</font>

575
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:11,450
one was so inclined then there's also a

576
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,799
package called multibond<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-monitor</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">while still happy HR to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> package yourself</font>

578
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,220
but multi one is a tool that because

lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> for users and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

also do things like a zaly here ever

some really impressed

you get everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our printer</font>

messages to nothing the best one was

603
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,420
served I saw a series of pages once

604
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,310
about a woman who and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's appear to be</font>

some sort of poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> updating for about 10</font>

606
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,810
minutes like this woman's panicking and

607
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:25,679
all the rest of it because her Pat's not

608
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:28,530
well and all is all this panic and drama

609
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,420
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get an</font>

613
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,399
points to that as well you could use a

614
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,330
4g dog walk on a device as well so

615
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,940
something like the view to that only<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,770
one USB port as well go but on other

620
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,530
you have some processing and

demodulation of geek code on the device

to have a much better time than trying

624
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,950
to stream the war signals up and you can

625
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,260
use a micro SD card for data logging so

626
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,620
that proves you don't show you any<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof</font>

627
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,750
for that will start this one is a duty

from around here or something like that

631
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,700
basically this has a smaller battery and

632
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,429
it has little micro SD coming off the

633
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,230
side so again you have a prior<font color="#E5E5E5"> to micro</font>

weapons they all technically governed by

the Bison are arranging we might be

00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:08,399
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that it's</font>

649
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:14,098
