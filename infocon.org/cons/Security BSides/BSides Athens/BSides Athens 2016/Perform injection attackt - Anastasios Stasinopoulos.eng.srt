or complete lack of intent of validation

26
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,428
for example the following piece of code

gets an IP address through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gate idea</font>

and a result of the execution music in

right so cute operations two main

<font color="#E5E5E5">have been going to use blind commands</font>

project for one end even if the attack

52
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,099
and injects an arbitrary c'mon to live

54
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:20,358
shop in the screen so conjectures

55
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:24,739
results with this let's see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

56
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">are ducks in detail so the first one is</font>

57
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:31,720
exactly the same example as previously

58
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,720
mentioned is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the photographer</font>

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:39,700
and I thought oh sorry someone who maybe

60
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:43,720
understand separator property come on in

61
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:48,399
both execution starts going to be let's

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at the blind case as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">see here there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not any echo at the</font>

64
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,950
start in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the flight the</font>

65
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,030
vulnerable part is the same so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

66
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:04,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">records just the IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address or some and</font>

67
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,580
I gathers disqualify between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

68
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,980
survivor and then other after one in

69
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,430
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases the execution results will be</font>

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,790
no division right so in order for

71
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,970
sealing we have to be blind first if you

72
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,039
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to eat so you</font>

73
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,130
completely blinded me is the thai place

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,500
like three which is based on time delays

75
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,760
the attacker can resume there's

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,550
architect go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> him firstly decide if</font>

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,539
the application is valid up to 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

78
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,060
blind comment section or not for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

79
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:43,210
this payload this payload is a new twist

80
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,580
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> around you selected sick character</font>

81
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,710
string is echo anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for half of that</font>

82
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,599
swing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> found to be six then slips for</font>

83
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:56,530
one second then the length of the output

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,230
c'mon determine exactly the same way as

85
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,010
previously mentioned here exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

86
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:08,160
same way though and finally here

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:13,140
authentic so on is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exporting right</font>

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly like in the strain gauge drivers</font>

89
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:21,460
the contribution is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a computing</font>

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,820
language it's a similar ah this

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">technique is the five basic black which</font>

92
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,520
is based on the fact which claims that

93
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,800
if it were not able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish also in</font>

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,960
solution directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> terminal</font>

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can write them to a</font>

right on route or access new buyers

98
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:46,660
right so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty</font>

99
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:51,909
straightforward way in order to the club

100
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:57,110
blind commentary here<font color="#CCCCCC"> an undetected</font>

101
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:59,509
this fine right problem here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

102
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the winner with a range of territories</font>

103
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:07,580
are no right we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the power</font>

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:11,020
technology RTP etc introduc to store a

file with the output of inject<font color="#CCCCCC"> common</font>

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,389
problem here is that we cannot predict

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,069
flash located in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

109
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:26,959
because you take the blackness of the V

110
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:29,659
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a 13 detection and you</font>

111
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,169
another community the cake at my place

112
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:35,058
the creek will develop and implement

design implementing this technique

114
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:40,610
applies the file basically in order to

115
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:43,068
store the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the injection into</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time base technique so in that way</font>

118
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,629
the contents of the files which are

00:06:52,779 --> 00:07:02,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the function how many of you</font>

know what is the going to me comics is
