that is a in the right equipment this is

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,120
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important step we go when it</font>

comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at that and romance</font>

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">response in general what you want to do</font>

50
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,689
is the topic you trying to connect to

51
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:53,548
your network and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerfulness probably sit down enough so</font>

53
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,849
in the right equipment very success step

54
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,999
the golden<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule here is that the more</font>

power gay men have the better pretty

56
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:11,879
simple so ideally the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario</font>

57
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacker could have to a half points so</font>

58
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,250
if then I kept target infrastructure

59
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,000
works out he will use one other point

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,759
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be from inside infrastructure</font>

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,870
and people spawn the robots point from

62
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,550
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> restaurant and he will use</font>

63
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,320
probably ate only directional antenna

64
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,840
police so can broadcast yes we go of

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,789
course should be bulky to prying eyes

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,969
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> half bloody country oh so yeah</font>

67
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:49,440
you'll be robbery guy or a wine my mind

68
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:53,940
up and the other that point should you

69
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,360
can be stopped using a dresser from

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,580
outside china daily so you have other

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,970
points14 choice they will appoint one

72
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,008
for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> services of us but there are</font>

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,840
getting done you can use the same

74
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:11,220
opponent still get that you can have

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,340
very good results so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

76
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,630
hope you have a plan this is what is how

77
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,020
are you could have it connect to a Wi-Fi

78
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:23,190
and then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away when you come back but</font>

79
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:26,520
why I your device automatically connects

80
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,199
to the the same Wi-Fi this is the goal

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a local nightclub</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure</font>

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,569
you're familiar movies this is a nigga

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,039

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,489
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat most of the times is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

87
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,188
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to explore this this plan</font>

88
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,300
and make use of this so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

89
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:58,339
doctor is saying so I think from the

90
00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:01,649
little man sir yes it's loud in 10 so

91
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,539
let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever you whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

92
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:08,639
turn on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> web that feature your</font>

93
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:13,438
device there's an algerie actually

94
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,589
chooses a network of your demise will

95
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:22,889
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the algorithm is pretty</font>

96
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:26,519
simple they want first of all you do

97
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:30,449
four in each side is an integra look for

98
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">each side making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ceases it's a preferred</font>

99
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,339
network since the pnl basis for working

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,249
the device has all the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

101
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:40,139
become a teacher so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look first for</font>

102
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:43,289
a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because already connected</font>

103
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,909
to the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't bear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same but</font>

104
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,279
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> program one they're like I</font>

105
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:49,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">network that this advice is going into</font>

106
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:55,009
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> past the device will choose the one</font>

107
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,009
the best signal look<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the signal</font>

108
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:04,110
so what yeah of course was to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

109
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:08,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">donut association with the big things</font>

110
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:11,939
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so these are the two things that</font>

111
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:14,639
the first bodies that's equal to our

112
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:18,689
spirit always to our suceda we already

113
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,459
talked about this out release all the

114
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:25,860
first one it wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something</font>

115
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:30,029
that already exists in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big things</font>

116
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,849
pnl professionalism so in early what

117
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:35,119
seat number one week understand

118
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:37,639
the devices are acknowledged by adding

119
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:39,979
to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else this is actually an</font>

120
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:44,119
association of a society that approach

121
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,580
name and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original so for example if</font>

122
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:49,189
I now commit to the besides habits that

123
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:53,149
we have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that may be</font>

124
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:57,649
too particular so my advice will store

125
00:07:53,149 --> 00:08:00,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">pnl of an association that besides up</font>

126
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:02,659
its the exciting and the the internship

127
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:07,999
will be WB to that means that in order

128
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:12,339
to connect me again you too fine and

129
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:16,369
then work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this 25 meters psh</font>

130
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:19,729
decreases<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're insane so that's what</font>

131
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:21,939
the attacker needs to do let's see how

132
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:24,649
in between words against<font color="#CCCCCC"> open networks</font>

133
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,399
first of all many of you may wonder why

134
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want in target of a network the things</font>

135
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,448
you said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an easy way to get</font>

136
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,810
money to be room for example are moving

137

is another way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes there</font>

138
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:43,338
munication if these are limitations that

139
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:48,139
four sections so<font color="#E5E5E5"> spawning the robotics</font>

140
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:51,759
point is some contributors it's easier

141
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:55,160
for having a big things connected to you

142

422
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,450
hard in my life so I'm going to me is

423
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,520
getting information from the people

and we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information to make</font>

427
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,399
an automatically generation so let's see

428
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,470
these scenarios would you do the first

429
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,190

434
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:45,750

determine the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banner of abscess 20pcs</font>

436
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,480
for example and we can make this much

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,660
more rallies we will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that consider</font>

440
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,520
on keeping the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor we can</font>

showing alleged failure basically so

443
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,070
first of all we can keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing either</font>

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">information right we have a row this</font>

the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers are so whenever you are</font>

so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing is</font>

454
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:39,330
will do is to explain it will monitor

straight up with our own HTML

458
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:51,449
we can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very realistic so the</font>

459
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:55,049
thinking what really realize this is

460
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:58,769
this is the website instead of the

461
00:25:55,049 --> 00:26:01,320
operating system and of course network

462
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:04,879
managers are teetering the graphical

463
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:08,668
user interface is different because

464
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:13,439
determine which operating system should

465
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:15,239
be me by the iterated generated and can

466
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,889
also feel is that book not too much

467
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:19,200
information for example the big oak

468
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:21,478
rates that are around this is the

469
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,429
breathing that I was popular with we do

470
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,079
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what members are around so we can</font>

471
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,329
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:38,099
next around things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make a network</font>
