and the third contribution is that we

also have a few optimization techniques

54
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,890
we will show you the luxury<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing i want i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk about</font>

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:10,600
briefly is how exactly we deal with

58
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:17,350
noise and india yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk about</font>

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">what noises first so real quick we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

60
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:27,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to blend all right so what is the noise</font>

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,450
so i will remind you real quick what the

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,400
reach of time does we have a victim that

63
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">is on some different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the attacker</font>

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,020
is controlling so the attacker has

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,570
access to the neighbor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim is</font>

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,570

68
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,250
the victim make several requests to the

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">target website this is given the</font>

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,720
existing west/andersen web security and

71
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,310
then the attacker can capture the cipher

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">text from the network so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

73

chosen plaintext attack of which the

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,810
attacker can see the side effects<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

75
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic assumption is that there's</font>

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,160
some sort of reflection so the the URL

77
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,570
of the target web

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,109
contains some parameter that is

79
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,150
reflected in the HTML body let's say and

80
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,430
this is all properly escaped and

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,690
everything is done correctly by an

82
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,240
implementer so what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> always is is the</font>

83
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,850
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the portions of the website so</font>

84
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,890
not the reflection not the secrets of

85
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,200
which are getting to decrypt from<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTS</font>

86
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,450
but anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that anything else</font>

87
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,580
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changing from request request</font>

88
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,060
since we're doing a chosen ciphertext

89
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,159
attack that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we will do</font>

90
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,260
several requests and it's convenient if

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,150
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else doesn't change except</font>

92
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the portions that we choose but no</font>

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,679
myspace is difficult so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

we're attacking them saying Twitter then

102
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,140
they have some suggestions of people to

follow they change perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> west so</font>

104
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,940
that's kind of thing that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,460
technical if we also have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

106
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">details of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my hair encoding which is</font>

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,520
like the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be closer people</font>

110
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,000
I've made some difference in what we're

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,890
doing I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the color coding which can</font>

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,710
introduce some tracking so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

113
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,630
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems and way we deal</font>

114
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,570
with this is quite simple really what we

115
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:41,280
do is we do some repeated attacks we

116
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:46,680
read them specific number of times

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">shoaling 1664 okay so we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,870
repetitions of the experiment and we

119
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,659
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract the me a chemical</font>

120
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,970
bridge the basic idea is that we only

121
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,460
expect the length of the ciphertext and

122
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,710
this is what makes it difficult in the

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,380
case of noise so nice changes the length

124
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,750
in in a way but it's a predictable way

125
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we extract the statistical need we</font>

126
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,090
only have 20 square root of M<font color="#CCCCCC"> times the</font>

127
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,510
requests that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were needed in the</font>

128
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:19,820
original breach attack without if you

129
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,780
have n sighs noise portion and

130
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,700
eventually know the length that we

131
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,349
measure all the network will converge to

132
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:33,990
the correct length i will take

133
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:37,380
repetitive eats<font color="#CCCCCC"> i first instead of just</font>

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,330
let's say that we want to we have

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,689
already we already know the prefix

correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> palette which is X Y Z then the</font>

153
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,690

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,630
tell which is your iphone which is not

159
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's see how our request our</font>

174
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,400
after that we woke up naked in character

175
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,350
in which case is a so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,990
we will see the puppies for work now so

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's see some of the organizations that</font>

these damn dates and separately 4012

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see who which one presents</font>

203
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:43,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">their blog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and differentiation and then</font>

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> assumed but it doesn't need to build</font>

211
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:16,670
over there so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure example that</font>

the first part of the oven<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a result</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">before because of alignment we have to</font>

do 16 request for holiday but and that's

221
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:56,519
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need this relation these 16 and</font>

want to perform 164 best and we really

don't care about the responses i don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">but we don't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because what we want</font>

231
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:36,389
to change this new length so we perform

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:39,389
over every cent which also try to run

233
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:45,119
all these requests together and brother

234
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:50,239
has specific aim for that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that</font>

235
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">we take the whole length and required by</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the amount</font>

paralyzation brother preparing penis is

241
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:14,540

242
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:18,899
an hour but we can notice that yes

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:23,610
brother allows a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six pardon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> request for</font>

245
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,370
time we have six requests and next time

246
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:31,649
have six more fast and so on and we

247
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">really do get to differentiate between</font>

248

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,599
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end we do we divide by the</font>

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,360
quite robust so if the user closes to

this case we have to pass these herbs

and my people and if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an error</font>

for a candid we pre issued be a double

there are other letters but also have a

shorter length of the rest of them this

363

all the attention part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking so</font>

401
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,160
do you should be frame working on to

executive them you say diction are

403

people in our clunking in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> attic so</font>

404
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:02,900
we use an existing framework called

405
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,620
better time for an injection question we

406
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,530
so rupture ruptures injection module is

basically a specific deployment of

better so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see my piece to do so</font>

409
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,990
now we have now first we have to develop

our own injection different markets it

411
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:27,740
says something<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source that we use</font>

412
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:30,710
and that's not only a esoteric the

413
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,930
counter you related that to some of the

not it's not install specific today ESS
