1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,190
thank you guys my name is Usama Kemal I

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,940
just do short consulting for the past

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,539
four to five years going around the

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,399
region

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,400
so I'm interacting with lots of

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,330
organization and today I'm just going to

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,220
share with you some of the experience

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:27,270
how we think that things should be done

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,200
to build detection capability for us the

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,820
sock is meant for detection and response

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,280
so they were going to focus on building

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,739
detection capabilities so from the sort

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,920
perspective so these are the key

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,870
elements that we should focus on and I

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,870
will go through some of them during this

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,818
presentation the first thing we need to

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,409
have like a strategy and roadmap and

18
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:51,780
I've seen lots of organizations they

19
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,460
just delegate their responsibilities of

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,409
their security operation to manage

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,899
service provider without understanding

22
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,659
what are the implications how things

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,519
will be running they let the managed

24
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,830
service provider drive their operation

25
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,590
which is usually not a good thing to do

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,240
so you need some kind of strategy and

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,290
roadmap how are you going to manage your

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,509
security operation centre definitely you

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,880
need some skilled resources even if you

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,680
are delegating your security operation

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,259
or getting a managed service provider

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,060
you need to have some resources and the

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,040
organization that understand what's

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,280
happening there your managed service

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,260
provider will not understand exactly how

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,270
things are going on your network so you

37
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,340
need someone on the on the ground who

38
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,530
understand the network we have the good

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,160
skills to run the operation or drive the

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,080
operation I cannot imagine a shock

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,509
running these days without automation

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,310
orchestration that saves lots of time

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,910
and we'll go through some of the

44
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,650
examples there detection framework we'll

45
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,619
go through what metrics and visibility

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,030
so I've seen also lots of sock

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,440
operations they don't have visibility

48
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,330
into what's going on

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,550
they have some nice reports and

50
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,380
dashboards on a video wall that doesn't

51
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,679
mean anything just for showing off for

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,179
the management or something like that

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,220
you need to build a good architecture

54
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:16,569
and to not just collect logs but just so

55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,260
I collect the right amount of logs

56
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,119
the right depth of box so let's go

57
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,129
through some of them very quickly we

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,249
don't have much time so for the

59
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,739
architecture people tend to mix between

60
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:32,138
coverage and visibility so for coverage

61
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,750
if you go to any organization they will

62
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,909
tell you yes I'm sending like 80% of my

63
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,609
systems I'm collecting logs out of them

64
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,828
that's easy what's usually ignored is

65
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,599
the visibility the depth of logging that

66
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:45,999
you are collecting so let's say you're

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,668
collecting logs from Windows Server what

68
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,260
kind of audit policy are there so can

69
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,750
give you lots of examples for that but

70
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,510
the huge usually people tend to ignore

71
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,639
the depth of logging that you are

72
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,969
collecting from your network so this is

73
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,879
very important to notice in terms of

74
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:05,319
fuse keys framework let's say you are

75
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,480
building a sock you need to build

76
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,909
enhance your detection capability so

77
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,429
enhancing your detection capability it's

78
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:16,179
not just technical thing it's a process

79
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,780
so you need to plan for it build your

80
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,150
use cases or rules run it find units in

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,090
hand set up dates and it's a full cycle

82
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,849
this full cycle there are some inputs to

83
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,650
it and these inputs will cover the gaps

84
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,530
that you usually have on your operation

85
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,629
and no matter doesn't matter if for how

86
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,009
many use cases or rules or how many

87
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,108
vendors you are getting into your

88
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,149
operation you will still have some gaps

89
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,859
in your or in your network and your

90
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,530
detection capability so that's why we

91
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,780
need some inputs from time to time you

92
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,109
need to have some redeeming exercise

93
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,400
adversary' simulation exercise

94
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,639
historical incidents all of these inputs

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,109
are very essential I mean the alien

96
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,269
sanction is building your detection

97
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:01,569
capability the outcome of these reports

98
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,790
will be an input to the sock to build

99
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,888
rules to close the gaps that found on

100
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,409
these capabilities and because of the

101
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,900
attackers are changing their tactics and

102
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:13,840
techniques all the time you will have to

103
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,400
have this gap exercise I mean the gap

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,149
assessment exercise from a technical

105
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,639
point of view to fit up into your sock

106
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,799
detection process thread hunting is very

107
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,900
important you build your hypothesis and

108
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,360
start doing threat hunting the gaps

109
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,840
again its feed

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,669
the detection capabilities there are

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,090
some business requirements some

112
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,620
compliance requirements your internal

113
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,080
policies you need to take it into

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,289
consideration if you go to the managed

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,150
security service provider or a vendor

116
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:47,370
they don't know these things I mean

117
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,138
that's it it has to come from internal

118
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,620
it you need to understand what are the

119
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,449
requirements inside the organization

120
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,949
usually people I mean the the what what

121
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,750
people are doing that they are start

122
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,310
with the threats start from the

123
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,800
technical board there are some tactics

124
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,310
and techniques you try to utilize mitre

125
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,169
attack framework and discovering the

126
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,699
threats but there are other elements you

127
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,008
need to consider to build your threat

128
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,389
detection capability so what we are

129
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,389
saying that we need to have a framework

130
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,789
and the framework is meant to organize

131
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,190
the whole process and document what are

132
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,110
you implementing for your detection

133
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,259
capability so it's the framework should

134
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,330
be a generic should be simple human

135
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,169
readable format that you can do some

136
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,628
researches and add some reporting it

137
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,909
should be very simple for the everyone

138
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,759
to understand how are you building your

139
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,800
detection inside the sock it's a kind of

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,960
documentation and I've seen lots of

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,270
people I mean the lots of sock

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,698
operation they don't exactly know what

143
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,400
kind of detection rules they have the

144
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,960
list keeps growing by time and they

145
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,620
don't know exactly what architecting

146
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,210
what are they looking at so that's

147
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,610
important to have like a kind of

148
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,080
documentation part and we'll talk about

149
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,639
the use case framework of structure

150
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,770
right now mitre attack mapping is now

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,919
everyone likes mitre attack it's good

152
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,690
point and you have to map your detection

153
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,219
capability to mitre attack when possible

154
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,039
some of the mitre attacks are very

155
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,770
generic you cannot map it but it's a

156
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,680
good thing to understand what are you

157
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,529
detecting based on mitre attack and it's

158
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,569
keeps the ongoing can has enhancement as

159
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,610
part of the process and of course we

160
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,409
need to have a unit test for most of the

161
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,180
rules and I've seen lots of again

162
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,639
organizations they have lots of rules

163
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,800
but many of these rules are not firing

164
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,600
either because they are having wrong

165
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,940
fields

166
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,130
are getting wrong look sources that will

167
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:47,030
never fire they just have the rules but

168
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,370
let's use this Hey so using mitre attack

169
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,690
I mean since everyone likes mitre attack

170
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,820
gets comprehensive knowledge of

171
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,950
adversary tactics and techniques it's

172
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,469
real words and keep growing and it's

173
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,780
always updated so it's it's nice to have

174
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,260
it back to your detection doing so this

175
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,270
is what we usually have for the

176
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,520
framework structure so we have on the

177
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,460
left side we have the use cases types so

178
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
you can have like the attack which is

179
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,229
the post exploitation rules and we have

180
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,390
the pre exploitation rules like pre

181
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,130
attack they have some rules for healthy

182
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,919
check if your block source is not

183
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,719
sending one of the like critical log

184
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,140
sources or not sending logs you need to

185
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,570
be alerted some policy violation based

186
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,159
on the organization security policy we

187
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,349
need to have rules to cover some of

188
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,900
these policies ot if you are running

189
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,300
goatee part and others the others are

190
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,219
the use case types that you cannot map

191
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,080
it to any of these things like I'm give

192
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,290
an example like malware infection you

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,960
cannot map it to which mitre attack

194
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:51,350
phases that you cannot map this so let's

195
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,049
put it on the others use Kies times and

196
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,570
then this part of this use case type

197
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,540
under this use case type we have use

198
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,940
cases so let's talk about attack one

199
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,290
example is like that exfiltration so the

200
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,660
use case would be data exfiltration

201
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,910
there is 1 to n relationship between

202
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,060
this under the desta data exfiltration

203
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,280
we have set of rules so you can do the

204
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,370
attacks filtration using DNS you can do

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,489
data exfiltration using ICMP you can do

206
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,700
it using HTTP you need to have several

207
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,250
rules under this use cases and for each

208
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,680
and every set of each and every rule we

209
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,680
need to set up the action so when you

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,570
have an alert for data exfiltration

211
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,969
what kind of action will be done either

212
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,099
sending an email will alert or report or

213
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,479
add to another another reference set

214
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:43,490
that can be used in a different rule

215
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,410
again we need to map the rule to a

216
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,570
response procedure I don't want my

217
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,310
analyst to just reinvent the wheel and

218
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,940
with the get alert they try to rethink

219
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,969
what I'm going to do so they

220
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,680
mapping should be idly one-to-one for

221
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,960
each and every rule we need to have a

222
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,150
playbook how are we going to handle this

223
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,180
playbook and this is very effective if

224
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:07,329
you are running a large operation again

225
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,459
for the unit tests this is again

226
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,320
important we have to for each and every

227
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,180
rule when applicable we need to have

228
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,180
unit tests and since some of the rules

229
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,010
cannot be tested in real life because

230
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,469
you need to install some attacking tools

231
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,960
or to do some actions that not usually

232
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,030
possible on operations operational

233
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,040
network but this is very important to

234
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,430
have unit tests to understand if the

235
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,640
rules are working effectively or not so

236
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,849
this is one example of the or tape one

237
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:42,189
of the techniques that in mitre which is

238
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,580
attack t10 7 6 which is RDP so starting

239
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,670
with RDP Remote Desktop Protocol there

240
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:51,340
are many event IDs and different systems

241
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,930
so it's not just when you start an RDP

242
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,200
session from your source to a

243
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:59,199
destination the event IDs from Windows

244
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,540
platform are exist in the destination

245
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,130
and on the active directory on the

246
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,689
Active Directory domain controllers you

247
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,000
have the authentication levels of

248
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,060
authentication events but also on the

249
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,840
destination you have different event IDs

250
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,520
and you need to understand this before

251
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,410
let's start with the RDP we need to

252
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,170
understand how the protocol is working

253
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,089
how the different fields are available

254
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,189
in each and every system of that so

255
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,950
let's focus on the events on the domain

256
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,860
controllers I'm not sure if this is

257
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,020
clear or not but so we have two event

258
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,900
IDs four four six two four four six two

259
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,720
five we need to understand each and

260
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,829
every field of these things so these are

261
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,560
general authentication event IDs and to

262
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,360
understand if it's RDP or not we'll look

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,250
at at the login type so logon type could

264
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,820
be like 10 or maybe seven if you are

265
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,350
connecting and there are some useful

266
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,810
information that you can build your

267
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,000
rules based on this information and most

268
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,790
of the vendors or same vendors they do

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,890
parsing for these events but not all of

270
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,769
them so you need to do parsing manually

271
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,290
or to add these fields to your

272
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,449
understanding understand see for let's

273
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,368
example for one example this the event

274
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,079
ided felt authentication you when you

275
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:17,249
have the workstation name you have the

276
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:20,959
source IP you have the status code why

277
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:23,790
this this logon failed and this sort

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,849
status codes are very important to

279
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,589
understand so from an analyst

280
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,809
perspective I need to know why this

281
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:32,730
authentication field so either it's the

282
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:36,079
username is wrong or the password is

283
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,360
wrong it's a disabled account or it's

284
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,248
password expired this kind of status

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,439
code understanding them and adding them

286
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:46,049
to your rules will help you in detecting

287
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:48,689
what's going on so for example I mean

288
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:52,139
we're talking just on RDP this is one

289
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:54,179
element one technique and the mitre

290
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,119
attack and we have like you can build

291
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:59,879
like 12 rules and more than that just by

292
00:11:57,119 --> 00:12:01,860
understanding the fields how this event

293
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,290
are working what are the messages we are

294
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,019
receiving so we can detect password

295
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,389
spraying attacks lots of other things

296
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,029
that can help you for detection the

297
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,279
problem is here even if you have these

298
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,249
kind of rules you need to map this to

299
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,019
your environment and most of the people

300
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:20,999
they don't really understand what's

301
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,290
happening all the environments so this

302
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,389
world will be applicable to one

303
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,579
organization and for other organization

304
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:28,529
it's not applicable

305
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,508
they have Pam they have jumped servers

306
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,100
they have other components that you need

307
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,019
to take into consideration when you are

308
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,790
building your roles here so not just

309
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,949
taking the what the vendor is giving you

310
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,079
we need you need to understand how the

311
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:43,349
environment is working and and in many

312
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,689
cases the sock team they don't really

313
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,610
know exactly how the network set up and

314
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,860
and in some cases they are hiding

315
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,910
isolated from the systems teams on the

316
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,160
network team they are not sharing

317
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,199
information but these are the challenges

318
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,319
that you need to overcome to build like

319
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,628
a good detection capability the next

320
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,069
part is reporting as this is what I'm

321
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,319
sharing with you was you need to have

322
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,389
fully automated by applying for

323
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:09,689
reporting and I've seen sock analysts

324
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:12,360
spending days I mean like at least one

325
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,459
day a week just to build reports having

326
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,430
screenshots manual rapport

327
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,330
copy/paste and the PowerPoint and

328
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,609
sending to the management for it's a

329
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,230
waste of time so what we are what we

330
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,090
need to achieve here is to have to need

331
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,010
to have a fully automated pipeline and

332
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,570
this is what we are doing using an

333
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,270
open-source tools called meter base

334
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,800
that's a bi tool open-source very easy

335
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:40,710
to set up and we are collecting the

336
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,569
whatever needed from our SEM whether the

337
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,820
same is whatever the same vendor they

338
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,060
all have api's you can collect data out

339
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,060
of it like number of collect the alerts

340
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,219
collected log sources status lots of

341
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,170
things that you can collect from the Sam

342
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,390
and also we need to collect some data

343
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,939
from the ticketing tool the technical

344
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,590
tool should be part of your sock of

345
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,260
course everything running on the sock

346
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,280
should be in a ticket either on

347
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,260
orchestration platform or a ticketing

348
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,270
tool you need to collect this

349
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,430
information regarding the incidence or

350
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,910
the tickets inside the sock once you

351
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,370
collect the data we're using log stash

352
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,069
it's an open source tool you collect the

353
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,310
Delta input and output the input is the

354
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,040
calling the API of your tools storing

355
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,020
the data into my sequel database and me

356
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,199
the base supports my sequel supports

357
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,790
lots of data stores even sequel ID so

358
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,890
once you have the data and your data

359
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,199
store you can visualize lots of things

360
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,420
so I'm just sharing some of the examples

361
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,350
of the reports that you can do freely I

362
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:47,219
mean it's not very complex like top 10

363
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,590
alerts top 10 log sources contributing

364
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,750
to alerts the purpose of reporting is

365
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,360
not just to show the management

366
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,770
it's the help you to make decisions

367
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,300
inside the sock so let's say we have

368
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,340
lots of lock sources contributing to

369
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,979
alert so we need to understand why we

370
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,480
have one log source having most of our

371
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,950
alerts coming from this log source I

372
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
need to understand what's going on

373
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,310
maybe tell some noise I need to

374
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,220
fine-tune maybe some I need to filter

375
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,500
some of these log sources so this is the

376
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,920
purpose of and one thing is the open

377
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,710
alerts the aging of the alerts and and I

378
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,349
need to understand why I have having

379
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,520
alerts that spanning over three weeks

380
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,530
maybe some of these alert

381
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,420
are waiting for action from the IT for

382
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,490
the network team from the system steams

383
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,160
this is very important I mean I need to

384
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,890
raise this my internal team is not

385
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,530
helping us to take actions on the

386
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:46,780
security alerts so this is the purpose

387
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:48,610
of the reporting other something another

388
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,610
example of the dashboard so that you can

389
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,400
build number of alerts created this week

390
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:58,720
you can have it drawn in a map lock

391
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,670
source coverage it's important dashboard

392
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
what kind of lock sources are not

393
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,229
sending logs I need to take care of

394
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,290
these things and this is if you built of

395
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,720
what you automated like pipeline for the

396
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,579
reporting you are saving lots of time to

397
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,240
generate reports here and this is the

398
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:19,750
purpose of that this is another sample

399
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,900
dashboard as the coverage of techniques

400
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,700
for your rules I mean my rules let's say

401
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,420
I mean if you look at these techniques

402
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,460
covered by rules I can see like the some

403
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,040
of these techniques I having having like

404
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,840
20 rules covering one technique and some

405
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,420
rules and having some techniques I have

406
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm having just one rule or two rules so

407
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,760
this will help you for deciding where I

408
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,990
should put some effort and my detection

409
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,439
capability to enhance it here and again

410
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,330
this can be happen only it it's fully

411
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,750
automated you can have to spend time on

412
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,400
it and it's almost in real time

413
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,050
the next element we need to focus on is

414
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,079
orchestration and orchestration

415
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,690
automation we need to understand why

416
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,640
it's important so the key element here

417
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,850
if you know what you are detecting and

418
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,580
you know how to respond to it in it

419
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:15,659
automated that's very clear there's no

420
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,760
need to spend time and doing the re

421
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,040
redoing everything every time it you're

422
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,990
getting a detection and response you

423
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,389
spend lots of time and having this cycle

424
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,700
again the data science is just exploring

425
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm not sure what I'm detecting I'm not

426
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,650
sure how responding to it the sock

427
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,440
analyst mindset just focusing on

428
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,500
responding to incident for the threat

429
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,810
hunter

430
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,700
focusing on detection and that's why in

431
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:45,040
the sock organization we tend to advise

432
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:49,760
people just have these rules separate so

433
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,430
detection that's hunting responding that

434
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,700
sock analysts different mindsets they

435
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:58,390
have different goals so if you can't

436
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,830
that's our advice to many people just

437
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,540
spread these rules together see the

438
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,639
threat hunting is one element one

439
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,080
function the sort and the sock analyst

440
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,060
is another function the sock analysts

441
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,090
want to close tickets where the threat

442
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,940
hunter is trying to find a sign of

443
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,530
exploitation inside the network so let's

444
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,870
start with like a simple use case for

445
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,220
the automation what what can you do so

446
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,439
let's say you have a SEM and you have a

447
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,750
rule and this rule fired we have a virus

448
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
detected it's not cleaned and it's an IT

449
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,610
admin workstation what can be done here

450
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,170
I can open take it automatically to an

451
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,510
automation orchestration platter and

452
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,520
then automatically collect some forensic

453
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,310
live forensics information from this

454
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,730
machine search the browsing history for

455
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,290
this user for the past few hours open a

456
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,840
ticket to the helpdesk to repair the

457
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,020
machine reset the user password send the

458
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,909
user SMS to inform him send the email

459
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,480
work or the hash to your sandbox

460
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,550
internally or externally and then send

461
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,310
the ticket to tier 2 analyst for this

462
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,550
process there's no tier 1 so we are

463
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:04,370
eliminating lots of time-consuming tasks

464
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,960
for the tier 1 and I would say this all

465
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,780
of these things can be happen in few

466
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,340
minutes usually in normal scenarios this

467
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:16,629
might take a week and then the process

468
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,850
continue has like normal process and

469
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:21,950
this is what another example of how you

470
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,020
can use the automation constellation

471
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,600
platform and this can be on commercial

472
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,590
product you can can even use open source

473
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,899
automation

474
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,639
I like ansible if you're no ansible you

475
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,380
can do some things of automation or

476
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,730
causation using open source tools as

477
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,980
well and this actions can be manually

478
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,350
semi automated or automated it depends

479
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,870
on how are you going to collect or

480
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,240
connect your orchestration platform to

481
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,530
your internal network so for example I

482
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,200
mean you have the amp

483
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,389
it's an escalation coming from your cell

484
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,540
going to your orchestration and platform

485
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,910
opening tickets and this you can open

486
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,860
ticket to for example like a service now

487
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,560
or whatever the ticketing tool or JIRA

488
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:07,399
or whatever for the IT team to take

489
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,050
action you can also manually invoke some

490
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,870
enrichments I need to collect some

491
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,490
information from a my EDR tool I need to

492
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,250
collect some live forensics information

493
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,230
I need to isolate the machine this can

494
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,280
be done in a few seconds actually not

495
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:25,070
not days some of the use cases here that

496
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,840
the very useful use cases like phishing

497
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,210
attack if you receive a phishing alert

498
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,830
or phishing advisory let's say from my

499
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,690
or from queue certs you have

500
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,139
intelligence advisory including fishing

501
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,450
it goes to automatically into your soar

502
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,630
platform the so platform automatically

503
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,660
extract the IOC's do some search on your

504
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:48,130
curator to understand if you have any

505
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:51,740
historical record of this Isis and again

506
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:55,430
talk to your SEM to add this IOC and to

507
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,500
reference set for future hits and then

508
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:59,960
open if you find anything you open a

509
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,510
ticket to the ticketing on the ticketing

510
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,350
tool to the team to take care of it so

511
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,180
you can do lots of minutes you can

512
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,350
imagine whatever scenario you have there

513
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,450
lots of things can be done with

514
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,280
automation and as I said I mean you

515
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,290
cannot I cannot imagine a sock operation

516
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,379
without automation these days you can

517
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,310
save lots of time if you took take about

518
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,050
let's talk about vulnerability

519
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,300
management I've seen one of the cases I

520
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,820
mean we built one of the cases when you

521
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,940
get vulnerability reports for some from

522
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,240
koalas for example some of the internet

523
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,460
exposed systems and it goes to the shore

524
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
platform automatically open a ticket to

525
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,600
the system owner wait for confirmation

526
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,210
from the system owner initiate another

527
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,669
scan close the ticket automatically so

528
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,610
this can be done fully automated without

529
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,140
involving human in this process so these

530
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,080
are sample of the use cases that you can

531
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,210
work on if you're trying to build an

532
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,980
automation orchestration platform you

533
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,020
have to start with the use cases it's

534
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,240
not about technology it's need to

535
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,100
understand what can what what are the

536
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,650
things that are taking most of my time

537
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,370
as

538
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:07,290
operation and then tackle these problems

539
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,270
like intelligence reports and advisories

540
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,700
phishing alerts vulnerability management

541
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,470
look sources errors privileged account

542
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,260
management malware these are very

543
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,140
straightforward playbooks that you can

544
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,270
automate and orchestrate and in an easy

545
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,010
way

546
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:25,920
another part of your operation you

547
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,410
should do some set hunting and threat

548
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,550
hunting this is the Pyramid of Payton

549
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,040
it's very famous

550
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,379
so the talk about threat hunting is not

551
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,600
about IOC it's not about IPS and domain

552
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,700
names and network artifacts is huge

553
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,679
about the tactics and techniques so at

554
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,080
the threat hunter if you have this red

555
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,970
hunting function inside the sock you

556
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,889
should focus on the threats and the

557
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,910
tactics and techniques that they are

558
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:53,220
using based on the reports received and

559
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,500
start start doing their investigation

560
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,570
build the hypothesis and try to figure

561
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,450
out if there is any exploitation sign

562
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:04,320
inside the network from the tools the

563
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:07,520
Japan cert they have nice report on the

564
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,500
attackers tools and how these tools will

565
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,930
generate logs in terms of Windows Event

566
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,700
and Lenox so these are a good starting

567
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,530
point to start the trend egg hunt it's

568
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,110
at hunting and you can do your threat

569
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:21,810
hunting activities and assem most people

570
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,550
they do hunting using EDR but again I

571
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,879
mean you have the same you have all the

572
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:30,930
logs and centralized why not starting

573
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,760
the threat hunting on the same the last

574
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,760
thing we don't have time now we have to

575
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,690
rush it's you need to practice and

576
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,250
practicing you need to if a stock

577
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,440
analyst need to build your lab you need

578
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:44,910
to get your hands dirty so this is my

579
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,890
own lab it's busy until and you see I'm

580
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,770
having like different it's a very small

581
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,870
device you can build lots of vm's you

582
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,910
can access from everywhere using 0 to

583
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,040
year it's an SDN VPN it's nice tool to

584
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,470
to get access to your home without

585
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,100
opening ports on the firewall or doing

586
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,350
any

587
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,409
netting or reverse netting so this is

588
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,409
nice to do and this is where I start in

589
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:10,470
like one year back and now I'm building

590
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:13,090
another lab using open source tools now

591
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,980
we have clouds you can build

592
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,649
your own lab on the clouds very easy

593
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,290
using telephone terraform is used to

594
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,290
provision virtual machines on the cloud

595
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:27,550
and you can have ansible to build your

596
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:30,460
own tools and all whatever setup you

597
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,680
need to build on your on these virtual

598
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,500
machines terraform supports different

599
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,420
cloud providers and it's easy to set up

600
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,440
and this is just an example of what the

601
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:44,320
kind of scripts you can just define the

602
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,000
virtual machine name the location which

603
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,490
zone the resource group IP is the disks

604
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,530
everything you can do it in a script and

605
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,090
just fire up the virtual machine it's in

606
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,820
a couple of minutes you have your lab up

607
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:00,669
and running and then you build your

608
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,830
tools using ansible and on the left side

609
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,500
I mean this is the elasticsearch how to

610
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,360
setup elasticsearch using ansible it's

611
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,870
very easy straightforward couple of

612
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,610
minutes you're done and just comparison

613
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,070
how much you're going to pay if you

614
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:18,070
cannot afford $1,000 to build like a

615
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,800
good lab in your home you can like for

616
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,169
less than five dollars a month you can

617
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,510
build a lab you can provision it you can

618
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,270
tear it down in a few minutes you don't

619
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,610
need a lab to be open 24 hours a day so

620
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,889
this is just using digital ocean pricing

621
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:36,780
just to give you an example of how much

622
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:39,900
it will cost to do this so and that's it

623
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,899
thank you

624
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,060
any question

625
00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:03,080
okay how we can start to for enhance the

626
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:07,469
use cases from where we can start

627
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:10,169
sucking well that's like a high-level

628
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,730
question but there are lots of things

629
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,880
you need to first to understand your

630
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,340
environment make sure that you're

631
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,330
collecting the right loke sources are

632
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:24,179
like login events and then look at mitre

633
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,550
attack and there are lots of good

634
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,740
information out there pick one or two

635
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,320
and they start the working on how to

636
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,180
detect these techniques or tactics and

637
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,480
techniques like I said I give an example

638
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,770
of RDP so start start with something I

639
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,560
mean you need to start I mean there are

640
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:43,350
lots of tactics and techniques out there

641
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,240
big some that some tech techniques that

642
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,550
you are familiar with and then start

643
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,100
building your rules based on these

644
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:54,090
techniques the information is available

645
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:58,709
on mitre attack websites and it gives

646
00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:00,540
you some advice and some even logic or

647
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,210
how to build some detection on it so

648
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:10,649
that's I mean I would say start with

649
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:14,720
mitre attack it's a good start so for

650
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:17,190
the use cases in the shock environment

651
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,200
first of all it's it's very complex you

652
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,370
know even in the presence of a framework

653
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,840
like mitre it's not easy for a client to

654
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,120
map at you know any other organization

655
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,570
it's it's very very complex how do you

656
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,689
see the role of you EPA in the in the in

657
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:36,030
the shock environment you know so many

658
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,210
use cases and these use cases you know

659
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,220
trigger you know and alert or not we are

660
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,840
always fighting for that so don't you

661
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,030
think in the next generation shock we

662
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,919
will be you know you'ii be able to play

663
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,290
playing a very important role in terms

664
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,010
of machine learning and AI you be able

665
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,960
talked about user behavior analytics

666
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,610
okay and that's of course I mean that's

667
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,530
part of all the if you've talked about

668
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:02,159
the vendors all of them they have you be

669
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,720
there so it's it's the UPA is

670
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,400
we're talking about artificial

671
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,190
intelligence and machine learning and

672
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,720
but this is just focusing on the user

673
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:14,190
and user behavior analytics but there

674
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,910
are other elements that are not covered

675
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:20,880
by UPA let's talk about DNS logs I mean

676
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:23,400
that's not there it's not related maybe

677
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,679
I'm not sure about the bottom or the UB

678
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,690
isms ingham that they're there they're

679
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,309
focusing on the user activity the

680
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:34,530
authentication the logins but not not

681
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,590
all the events that you can see on the

682
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:39,090
network but again that it's all of the

683
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,039
vendors they are providing the same

684
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:47,129
functionality as part of their offering

685
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:49,309
so it's it's important definitely thank

686
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,309
you

687
00:28:50,110 --> 00:29:00,629
[Applause]

688
