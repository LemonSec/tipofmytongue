1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:06,508
all right thank you very much guys this

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,850
is the last talk so I know everybody's

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,940
tired so I'll try to be relatively quick

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,210
and not too boring if I'm boring please

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,009
shout this is not necessarily a

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,930
technical talk this is just something

7
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:22,199
I've been looking on for the last couple

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,720
of years basically how much money can

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,760
make by doing malware and by malware I

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,590
mean run somewhere and some of the other

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,939
malicious activities that you can

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,350
purchase on the Internet in some other

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:37,020
places we're gonna discuss the market

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,030
the maturity and offering investment

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,540
opportunities and the transactional

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,510
safety very quickly we'll go into

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,089
everything else so first of all about

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,670
them about the market so the market

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,379
itself actually if you look at the size

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,270
of a run summer market is estimated to

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,930
be about a billion dollars a year right

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,100
now Francisco and Cisco's revenue every

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:05,280
year is about 49 billion suppose thank

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,650
you very much but here we also go to

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,180
crime as a service so basically doing

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,520
services for somebody else breaking into

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,680
organizations and everything else that

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,570
follows those activities so things like

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,140
for example IP theft is estimated to be

30
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,789
about 500 billion revenue a year data

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,770
trading is basically just selling

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,090
people's data on the internet about a

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,619
hundred eighty billion and then there

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,270
are illegal markets so that could be

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,549
anything from selling weapons to selling

36
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,560
tanks and doing all kinds of malicious

37
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,520
activities as well so our potential for

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,750
earning revenue is actually pretty high

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,119
chopping away some of the money from the

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,960
primary illegal market would be very

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,240
good in this case now it is estimated

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,339
this is this guy stats for the 2015 that

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,259
per every dollar invested into

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,390
ransomware you could get for over $1400

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,920
return so simply investing hundred

46
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,630
dollars of your time or time and money

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,520
will actually mean it is pretty high

48
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,060
return now obviously as time progresses

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,250
this return gets lower so new security

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,599
technologies new ways of doing so we've

51
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,129
heard some of the kind of interesting

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,519
conversations today about shock and

53
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,549
monitoring

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,310
picking up unusual treads picking up

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,410
some of the malicious activities that

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,750
will basically reduce that all right so

57
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,920
this is for 2015 I estimate probably

58
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,650
that about now maybe it's about $1,200 a

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,429
pair every dollar that you spend which

60
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,570
is still quite substantial and finally

61
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,150
we have a mature industry

62
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,950
so actually malicious industry so we can

63
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,480
think about is like black markets and

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,160
the services and everything else is

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,709
actually pretty mature so nowadays

66
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,310
there's a selection of services that can

67
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,720
be taken so for example we can rent them

68
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,730
all room so we can rent assistance which

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,540
are infected we can rent the hacker

70
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,910
which is which is actually quite costly

71
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,230
there's the traditional activities such

72
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,810
as for example buying run somewhere

73
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,160
payloads or run somewhere encryption so

74
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,110
you can buy that you can have clicked

75
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,760
for identity theft

76
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,900
it's one of the one of the popular ones

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,850
that's been running around for years

78
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,040
stealing personal data using this to

79
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,900
take loans and things set up so all of

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,320
this you can actually buy you can even

81
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,670
buy a banking Trojans so for example is

82
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,500
used Maurer that was seven hundred

83
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,089
dollars a piece so if you wanted to have

84
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,680
a starter part without any other

85
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,330
additional plugins that's seven hundred

86
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,769
bucks that you pay and from there all

87
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,040
you have to do is to basically just send

88
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,040
it out

89
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,519
you can rent infrastructure so you have

90
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,950
infrastructure as a service so if you

91
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,140
want to host for example c2 or some

92
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,359
other runs so we're all malicious code

93
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,260
or or have basically on infrastructure

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,260
in some countries which are not

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,660
necessary

96
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,209
it won't basically try to put you in

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,650
jail if you host it there you can do

98
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,840
this and there's also the traditional

99
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,220
things such as DDoS extortions where you

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,579
basically threaten customers to run

101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,609
denial of service and then you basically

102
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:06,190
rent that out now each of these have

103
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,959
actually a price tag on it so for

104
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,820
example renting a hacker can set you

105
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,930
back about thirty thousand dollars now

106
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,239
it obviously depends on what the hacker

107
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,650
meant to be doing it will depend on the

108
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,019
activities and the scope and how

109
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,280
difficult is to break into organization

110
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,530
but you can count for more or less

111
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,599
thirty thousand bucks

112
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,340
DDoS extortion goes about between five

113
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,050
hundred and fifteen hundred dollars per

114
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,460
attack so for example you can actually

115
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,600
rent out infrastructure to do this

116
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,250
yourself

117
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,630
or you can simply pay somebody to do

118
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,000
denial-of-service and send an email to

119
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,400
company that you will toast them right

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,750
for simple spam for sending about

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,370
hundred thousand emails you get about

122
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,630
you need to pay about the dollar right

123
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,060
so actually if you think from the

124
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,610
perspective of an attacker they need to

125
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,140
invest maybe about twenty-five to thirty

126
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,290
dollars to send pretty much all the runs

127
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,610
somewhere they can get the handsome you

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,710
can rent a malware obviously so you can

129
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,330
rent out infected systems and basically

130
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,870
do any bidding you want so it could be

131
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,219
as simple as running the service against

132
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,230
any kind of tradition other traditional

133
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,970
ones you can for example just pay 500

134
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,920
bucks for runs the workout right and

135
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,910
then all that matters is then simply

136
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,650
deploying the run somewhere out so it is

137
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,070
actually quite profitable industry

138
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,960
nowadays and it's also regionalised

139
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,659
so you have regions which are being

140
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,229
attacked so it's not necessarily about a

141
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,150
global outreach so to speak not every

142
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,490
country will be attacked and not every

143
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,380
country will be will be targeted by the

144
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,030
campaigns which means that you most

145
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,800
likely will target or the hackers will

146
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,830
most likely target specific countries

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,580
into specific specific places so let's

148
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,349
see if I can

149
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,789
nobody really targets North Africa that

150
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,230
much for example but there's a lot of

151
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,270
activities going around where we are

152
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,130
this is actually based on Kaspersky

153
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,440
research there's a lot of target going

154
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,990
against Europe same with North America

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,270
some parts of South America South South

156
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,860
Africa as well but there are not many

157
00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:01,240
activities going against a middle Africa

158
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,650
or Central America so you will be so

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,270
hackers basically target very specific

160
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,679
regions and they do this for a reason

161
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:11,169
because this is where they can monetize

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,150
most of the income right but nowadays

163
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,130
actually they're getting a lot smarter

164
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,349
so nowadays you can actually deploy

165
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,969
ransomware which costs nothing right so

166
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,560
if previously for example you might have

167
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,360
to pay a specific amount of money for

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,030
ransomware code you know you can use

169
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,800
things like BitLocker which is which is

170
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,539
you know a tool which is used in

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,860
Microsoft Windows it's by popular we

172
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,240
always recommend the customers enable

173
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,160
them on the laptop or the workstations

174
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,110
but actually it can turn this into runs

175
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,000
were right there are public scripts that

176
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,180
do this in PowerShell dating back to

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,580
2016 and it's very difficult to recover

178
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,169
from

179
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:49,068
this is protection method used

180
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:50,299
effectively against the organization in

181
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,759
terms of what you actually need to pay

182
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,199
right so the interesting part here is

183
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,520
how much money to spend on how much

184
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,960
money you're getting back from the

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,609
market perspective you need to spend as

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
little as you can to get to maximize

187
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,490
your return if we look at the numbers

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,479
from 2015 for example you will be

189
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,699
investing in things like bulletproof

190
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,258
hosting so whatever folks in woodby will

191
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,139
be hosting your infrastructure in places

192
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,930
where the law can easily take it down

193
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,120
you would probably pay between $700 and

194
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,740
5000 for a run somewhere again that

195
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,569
depends on this is actually the most

196
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,219
expensive piece but that depends on well

197
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,810
actually deploying nowadays like I said

198
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:26,750
you might as well just deploy PowerShell

199
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,190
with a bit of it locker lockdown you

200
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,080
wipe you would pay some money for

201
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,669
payload publication so as you send

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,169
obviously your emails out you don't be

203
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,198
sending ransomware directly into emails

204
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,789
the payload will need to be obfuscated

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,770
and we need to be obviously bypassing

206
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,688
anti viruses and phishing gateways and

207
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,240
things set up you might want to add some

208
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,919
call services so somebody picks up the

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,090
phone on the customer calls and say look

210
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,789
I've been affected by ransomware

211
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,619
I need some help here and this is this

212
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,360
is exactly this will be your source of

213
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,949
income actually because somebody will

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,860
pick up the phone and say well to pay us

215
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:01,279
however much you need to pay us and then

216
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,110
we will computer you might have to pay a

217
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,300
bit of money for 40 documents so if

218
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,419
you're creating a if you try to create a

219
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,800
a semi-legit company and use use that

220
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,270
company to send out and run somewhere

221
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,949
for example you try to pretend to be a

222
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,180
marketing company then you need to have

223
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,680
some forged documents and those

224
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,219
documents will basically create the

225
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,440
basis of your deployment and you need to

226
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:22,940
pay for some traffic right so somebody

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,190
used to be sending emails out where this

228
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,680
is yourself or a friendly hacker on the

229
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,750
market and they'll you give them your

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,039
payload you give them their the email

231
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,240
description and the content and

232
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,029
everything else and they'll simply send

233
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
this to you if you look at kind of

234
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,110
investment and how much money you have

235
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,579
to actually put in crunching up some of

236
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,339
those numbers you basically get a number

237
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:44,680
between about $3,000 to about plus two

238
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,640
five and a half thousand dollars

239
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,109
investment so this is how much money

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,220
actually we need to pay to run a

241
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,949
successful campaign

242
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,170
deploying ransomware right obviously the

243
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,849
statistics are from 2015 so

244
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,589
today we probably would need to pay a

245
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,460
little bit more than that but I didn't

246
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:04,100
think necessary thing you'll be

247
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,990
significantly more now in terms of what

248
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,760
what happens once you actually run the

249
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,660
campaign well obviously you want to

250
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,750
collect the money

251
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,180
so campaigns the campaigns that the

252
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,520
Atticus run actually recently on our

253
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,959
estate conference 2020 FBI have made a

254
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,410
bit of research about where the money

255
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,270
goes

256
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,800
so when you actually attack companies

257
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,880
and you send a phishing email the

258
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,650
phishing email will contain some sort of

259
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,870
ransomware payload it executes and it

260
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,980
starts encrypting the disks the next

261
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,140
question is how do you actually collect

262
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,450
the money from that right now there very

263
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,210
easy way nowadays is obviously with

264
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,700
Bitcoin right so this is against the US

265
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,080
market so nearest market FBI has debated

266
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,000
that dle is about a hundred forty

267
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,100
million s being paid out which means

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,470
that for example 63 millions from that

269
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,660
literally go to the Bitcoin exchanges

270
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,280
right which is the most common way of

271
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,740
paying for answer where you simply get a

272
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,569
note with the exchange with the address

273
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,610
for a Bitcoin or email address to get

274
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,870
the Bitcoin address you come back with

275
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,570
them and they seem to give you give you

276
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,400
the address to send money to some of the

277
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,930
bitcoins don't get spent so quite a lot

278
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,020
of the money doesn't actually go

279
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,430
anywhere it just sits in bitcoins the

280
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,980
reason for that is because a lot of the

281
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,870
exchanges they actually require proof of

282
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,550
like identification to open the account

283
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,250
so you need to send a copy of your

284
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,750
passport to an exchange so they open

285
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,780
your account so that means that actually

286
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,400
from the identity perspective the

287
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,569
attackers will try to conceal this and I

288
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,770
think this is also the reason why they

289
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,390
don't necessary spend all of the money

290
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,670
because if the exchange will need your

291
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,140
documentation well it's gonna be very

292
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,469
dangerous to take try to take the cash

293
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,520
out quite a lot of this actually go to

294
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,040
some unknown sources

295
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,150
I suspect that part of this is basically

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,860
to do with the money mules

297
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,390
so money meals will try to convert

298
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,880
Bitcoin and take the risk of being

299
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:48,050
arrested for it for 40% cut for them and

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,030
there are some other services such as

301
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,979
merchant services Dartmouth markets but

302
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,250
that's actually a small percentage using

303
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,740
the gambling wallets mining pools and

304
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,620
things side up right so actually if you

305
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,540
look at how much money gets out this is

306
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,670
this is just the American market it's

307
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,630
quite a lot so yearly you get 140

308
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,729
millions dollars being paid

309
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,290
outwards run somewhere and this is this

310
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,430
is basically what's being taken up not

311
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,130
all of this will be touched

312
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:20,540
as you can see 36 million that just

313
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:23,040
stays there and here's a final thought

314
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,589
so security can be about increasing the

315
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,810
cost right so if we make it very

316
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,270
difficult for the attackers to basically

317
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,030
buy into this market that means that

318
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,199
they'll basically stop ordering right if

319
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,140
it gets to the point where somebody

320
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,910
should put 10 to 15 thousand dollars to

321
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,280
actually launch a successful campaign

322
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,689
I reckon probably a lot of people will

323
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,970
just give up because they're not gonna

324
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,960
have the input or enough money to

325
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,060
actually launch that campaign

326
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,950
successfully what this also mean is that

327
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,510
actually a lot of the players that will

328
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,860
eventually stay in the market and doing

329
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,010
some of those attacks that just run

330
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,960
somewhere or some of the other ones they

331
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,220
will basically be the very professional

332
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,720
ones those were the ones that gonna

333
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,580
survive the kind of increased cost right

334
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,320
but obviously security doesn't have to

335
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,690
be expensive if we actually look at some

336
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,420
of the findings that FBI has based on

337
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:16,560
the report from 2020 on the run so where

338
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,390
some of the very basic hardening is the

339
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,420
reason the missing hardening is the

340
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,610
reason why people basically get hit run

341
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,140
somewhere and by some systems are not

342
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,760
being patched there's no segmentation

343
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,470
there's not necessarily lockdown on

344
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,970
services whether this is firewall level

345
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,700
so simply just look now what's available

346
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,950
in systems and most of the organizations

347
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,560
don't really know their assets and those

348
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,300
four factors contribute quite a lot to

349
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,430
why the malicious market can actually

350
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,930
drive a lot of those activities they

351
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,479
kind of tied together so obviously you

352
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,060
might have to send phishing emails with

353
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,840
the payloads with a specific

354
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,229
infrastructure that you will host your

355
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,060
things on but then if it has if its

356
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,590
target system which isn't patched for

357
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,689
the last few years then is very easy for

358
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,400
ransomware to spread right so a lot of

359
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,310
the actual activities in the market that

360
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,380
will basically just tied up together and

361
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,439
we can can reduce this as defenders we

362
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,520
can actually start introducing incident

363
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,020
response plans and some of the other

364
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,170
things that our code is mentioned today

365
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,939
but getting the back basic cyber

366
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,479
health checks effectively you will

367
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:22,939
actually help as well that's it from me

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,939
indecent into man any questions

369
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:39,689
go on yeah so this is actually the

370
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,449
absolutely right so a lot of this is not

371
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,219
necessary recorded this is this is of

372
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,868
the case of what FBI managed to get

373
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,459
their hands off in terms of people

374
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,929
actually admitting that yes we've paid

375
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,660
for example two million towards this

376
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,970
organization I suspect that the actual

377
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,279
real number so the 144 is probably

378
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,169
double in the reality and this is just

379
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,540
for America market this is not necessary

380
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,749
per you know everything else I don't

381
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,219
even

382
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:03,509
we don't necessary even know the stats

383
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,049
for things like for example Middle East

384
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,639
or Europe because nobody publishes them

385
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:10,410
and this is first time that actually FBI

386
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,759
has shared those kind of stats and how

387
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,929
much money they see going to various

388
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:20,480
organizations and payouts and other

389
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,480
questions shout loud

390
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:36,329
how much of the of this is true there is

391
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,839
discussion that there is a trend of

392
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:45,899
ransomware attackers having other ways

393
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:48,839
to monetize such as threatening to talk

394
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:54,990
to you or publish your documents or

395
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:57,389
getting to destroy things that data that

396
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,069
you have mm-hmm so a lot of the

397
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,569
organizations the one necessary admit

398
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,800
that this happens but as an incident

399
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,689
responder I can tell you that I've been

400
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,878
a few situation so organization has been

401
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:07,949
treated to if you're not gonna pay us

402
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,959
$1200 for example we will toss you

403
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,459
alright now some other organizations are

404
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,689
very happy to kind of say well you know

405
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,540
gonna do that we have enough resources

406
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:18,420
to do to withstand this some of them

407
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,800
will simply pay right so we always

408
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,449
advise people not to pay because

409
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,269
basically that means that you just

410
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,378
supporting criminals effectively but

411
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:27,779
there's many different ways they can

412
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,790
monetize I've seen cases where for

413
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,439
example ransomware data so before the

414
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,809
ransomware was deployed somebody stole

415
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:35,309
the data and sold it as well so not only

416
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,170
they would get payout from the actual

417
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,670
ransomware itself they'll actually get

418
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,729
the payout from selling the data and

419
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,990
selling the AP itself right and you know

420
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,420
there's a whole bunch of other things so

421
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,649
for example um couple of years back

422
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,229
there's been a big trend of selling

423
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,790
access to companies so there was a C to

424
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,800
running within the organization and

425
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,120
somebody who for say a hundred hundred

426
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
dollars would simply just give you

427
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,899
access to that C to right now whatever

428
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,519
you do with a situ is up to you right

429
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,319
but you at the same time as you give

430
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,790
somebody that C to UMass will deploy for

431
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,709
some consumer or you might deploy some

432
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,689
other malicious code or you might have

433
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:08,758
some some other means of trying to

434
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:10,740
extort the data or get the data out in

435
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,629
which case you sell that data and we

436
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,540
know that for example if you look at

437
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:20,639
this slide you know identity theft right

438
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,868
very record you get between five to ten

439
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,549
dollars now depending what that record

440
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:25,949
actually is so you might get for example

441
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,009
full passport as well as a credit card

442
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:31,498
number as well as the C V to C V V sorry

443
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:32,730
and as well as some other data is now if

444
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:34,319
you can connect all of that you probably

445
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,850
get about ten dollars for each of the

446
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,800
records so before you even deployed

447
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,420
around somewhere you might

448
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,579
sell that day town if you build it of

449
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,339
course and you know some of the biggest

450
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,810
hack that we've seen around like I think

451
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,550
Mario Tour star with whatever they're

452
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,199
called I wouldn't be surprised if that

453
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,290
all of that data was sold before even

454
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,519
people realized that their hack is going

455
00:16:50,290 --> 00:17:01,579
right because it's just additional

456
00:16:52,519 --> 00:17:03,769
source of income anything else so does

457
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:06,709
the FBI has their own way to the very

458
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,670
specific Bitcoin wallet so to detect who

459
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,550
owns the wallet

460
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,600
so actually the principle of Bitcoin and

461
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,678
of how it works

462
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,409
which means that all of the

463
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,120
transactional records are known right so

464
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,790
everybody can look up every transaction

465
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,800
that's how Bitcoin operates so all you

466
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,659
have to do is to literally sign sing the

467
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,030
entire ledger and then search for a

468
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,740
specific address so for example for FBI

469
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,540
is actually very easy to track this

470
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,730
because let's say there is a ransomware

471
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,309
note that says please send us 5 bitcoins

472
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,870
towards this address right well if that

473
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:37,820
happens then that this address can be

474
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,100
easily tracked in the entire ledger and

475
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,909
you then work out well actually this is

476
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,379
where the money went

477
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,690
so we can actually also look up how much

478
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,040
money goes to specific address so if we

479
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,630
know the specific address and we know

480
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,668
how much money goes there then we can

481
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,030
work out how many people actually pay

482
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,770
that

483
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,870
so for FBI for example they would look

484
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,270
across all of the organizations who've

485
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,899
reported the ransomware they would check

486
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,129
the addresses so which address actually

487
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,570
corresponds to the specific organization

488
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,160
and they can work out basically based on

489
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,928
tracking the address how many of them

490
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,169
paid off right so you see that this

491
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:13,480
specific Bitcoin address we would say 5

492
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,480
bitcoins over the course of 30 days for

493
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,629
something else

494
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,988
