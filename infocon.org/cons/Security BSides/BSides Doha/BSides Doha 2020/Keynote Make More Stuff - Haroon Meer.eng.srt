1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,160
my name is Harun and the thing I wanna

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,280
talk about today pretty much is why we

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:15,469
should make more stuff that's pretty

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:19,729
vague sounding so again on a start by

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:21,970
saying thanks and sorry thanks for the

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,500
invite thanks for having me out here

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,369
it's actually the first besides that I'm

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,820
speaking it and to all of you thanks for

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,009
coming

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,980
it's a Saturday and I'm sure you had

11
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,820
better things to do and in truth most

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,910
keynotes

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,980
generally are terrible like like I've

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:43,190
watched lots and lots of talks in my

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:46,099
life but very few keynotes because

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:50,030
generally they pretty bad normally they

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,760
some old guy trying to sell you stuff or

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,659
it's an old guy trying to give you

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,409
advice and this one is pretty much an

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:02,059
old guy trying to give you advice for

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,869
those of you who remember in the 90s

22
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,490
there was a song called wear sunscreen

23
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:09,770
and and part of the reason why I think

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,770
you should say thanks so I should say

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,048
thanks is because giving advice almost

26
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,090
requires a favor from you like you've

27
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,290
got a grill in bed like I actually know

28
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:23,000
what I'm talking about

29
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,950
and then I'd like to say sorry for one

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,380
part because my voice is a little

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,430
nasally for the other because I keep

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,829
saying um a lot I've been told that I

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,469
should do better two years ago my sister

34
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,508
sent me a message telling me she's going

35
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:41,089
for training I should really go training

36
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,850
in in the sort of way that only a big

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,259
sister can do and and the other reason I

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,649
wanna say sorry is because I actually

39
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,259
saw Shareef slides and they beautiful

40
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,450
and they smart and mine are none of

41
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,219
those things and which is probably a

42
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,219
pointer for who you should get to

43
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:58,969
keynote next year the other reason I

44
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,309
want to say sorry

45
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:03,890
two more reasons is because if you've

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,630
ever spent any time with me the stuff

47
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,770
that I'm gonna say now you've probably

48
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:12,049
heard before not because I'm lazy but

49
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,150
because I really believe in some of the

50
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,500
stuff that I'm gonna say and chances are

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,100
you've heard me rant about

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,500
before and the other reason that's worth

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,549
mentioning is some of the stuff will

54
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,830
probably sting a little like in part I

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,620
think that that's what the keynote

56
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,150
should be like if a keynote came up and

57
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,670
just said what you were expecting it

58
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,640
would be a pretty terrible keynote but

59
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,739
but I think that that sometimes it's

60
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,579
necessary and and the main piece of

61
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:46,250
advice that I want to give is like try

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,989
to resist the urge to just kick it out

63
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,160
because of something that I say that

64
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,470
stupid or because I say um too much

65
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,530
there's there's probably some stuff

66
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,209
that's worth listening to in there

67
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,090
so so right at the top the question

68
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:05,390
should be um why should you listen to me

69
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,140
in truth I can't think of too many good

70
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:12,708
reasons in in terms of my bio um I've

71
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,109
been doing technical security stuff I've

72
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,840
been computing for a pretty long time

73
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,970
and and one of the good things is like

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,459
I've been really lucky to work in lots

75
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,400
of different roles and with some of the

76
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,380
best people in the industry so so even

77
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,660
if the stuff didn't rub off on to me

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,750
like I've had a chance to look at some

79
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,810
really great people up close and and

80
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,519
would that come some insights into what

81
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,549
makes the difference between people who

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,720
are absolutely leaders in the field and

83
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:48,500
people who are not so what the talk is

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280
about um really simply I'm gonna do

85
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,310
three things

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,910
um one I'm gonna get on my favorite

87
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,650
soapbox on for a little bit too is a

88
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,140
little bit of a hack I'm gonna give you

89
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,900
interesting links so even if everything

90
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,850
that I say is stupid if you follow the

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,910
links that I give you it should be worth

92
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,880
the talk and then Sharif insisted that I

93
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,530
leave time for questions mostly so you

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,120
guys can disagree with me and tell me

95
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,470
why I'm stupid

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:22,700
so my soapbox for the most part is just

97
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:25,460
two points it's why I want us to make

98
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,719
more things and then I want to look a

99
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,960
little bit

100
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,020
why we haven't been making things okay

101
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,599
um witches which is pretty simple um so

102
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,760
in terms of making more things I'm gonna

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,390
start off how many of you here were the

104
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,719
quick show of hands can code so some

105
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,630
level of scripting how many of you think

106
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,640
you don't need to okay it's a discussion

107
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,100
that comes up periodically where people

108
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,620
ask in the industry like do I need to

109
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,960
code to do security and if you go online

110
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,420
you'll see people disagreeing even some

111
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,020
smart people saying that you don't need

112
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:07,070
to and I want to say I think they cut my

113
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,140
mic okay I want to say absolutely I

114
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,440
think you need to code let's try this

115
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:16,400
okay so so I'm gonna say you absolutely

116
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,140
need to code okay and and again this is

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,450
one of those things that might sting if

118
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,210
you can't um but it's something you

119
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,159
should absolutely work on and and I say

120
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,900
this to all my young cousins to all my

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,730
family like no matter what could hear

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,299
you in right now like even if you're in

123
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,640
pharmacy coding is a superpower it'll

124
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,740
help you do whatever you do better and

125
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,380
if you're planning on doing info say

126
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,880
then it's absolutely a must have now

127
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,800
this doesn't mean you need to code at

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,930
the level where you can pass a google

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
coding interview but you should be able

130
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,940
to script in Perl Python c-sharp

131
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,240
something you should be able to bash

132
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,190
script together and automate stuff for

133
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,840
security I've actually got a few

134
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,229
arguments for it but but I'm gonna

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,479
choose to today um the one is a little

136
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,740
while back um I gave a talk at a

137
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,050
conference in Finland where I spoke

138
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,720
about learning the wrong lessons from

139
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,880
offense so for years we've been telling

140
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,440
people that they need to learn from

141
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,800
attackers you need to learn how

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,930
attackers work and mostly that advice

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,510
has been terrible okay you can't just

144
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,430
learn to think like an attacker in the

145
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,890
same way that you can't just learn to

146
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,290
think like a chef if you tell someone go

147
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,520
into kitchen think like a chef chances

148
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,960
are they're not going to do anything

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,570
great

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,340
but one of the big things and you can

151
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,860
look at several advantages that

152
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,679
attackers have over defenders but one of

153
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,590
the big ones is that attackers write

154
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,130
code okay it's really hard to find

155
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,500
people who do good offensive work who

156
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,780
don't also code okay

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,759
they patching their tools all the time

158
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,580
they're writing new tools all the time

159
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:06,160
it's almost essential if you want to be

160
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:10,698
an apex played attacker try swapping

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,610
quotes oh um so a few years back Alex

162
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,960
Thomas gave a talk where he divided the

163
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,680
world he said if you looked at the

164
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,130
fortune 500 you'd have the secure 100

165
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,889
who knew how to play the game and after

166
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:28,280
that he had what he called the toasted

167
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,190
400 okay and when asked the biggest

168
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,258
difference between those two you'd see

169
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,169
he said secure software engineering

170
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:40,070
engineering focused IR and the ability

171
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,840
to create not by solutions was the big

172
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,750
differentiator between whether you were

173
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,020
in the can play the game or the toasted

174
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,330
400 okay this is a huge huge thing to

175
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,210
ponder you're talking about the 500

176
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,460
richest companies in the world and 400

177
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,810
of them are considered toasted you've

178
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,830
gotta figure where your organization

179
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:04,159
fits into this and of course famously in

180
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,120
2011 Marc Andreessen said software is

181
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,099
eating the world

182
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,710
okay essentially he was saying that all

183
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,919
companies will be software companies um

184
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,250
in the future and we see this happening

185
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,169
now with good defensive teams for a long

186
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,360
time it didn't matter what you were

187
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:23,240
doing in security you almost couldn't

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,150
defend your organization and then we

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,580
started to see really solid security

190
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,789
teams coming out of startups in Silicon

191
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,890
Valley this is one of those slides where

192
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,679
later on if you go and pick the links it

193
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,968
makes the whole talk worth it just

194
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,179
because you should totally go and watch

195
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,900
these talks um so so from the top I'm

196
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,699
going to talk about those two guys

197
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,630
to the talk when they were working for

198
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,360
square a they did a talk on crypto

199
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:55,180
anchors um hands up anyone who's ever

200
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,480
heard of crypto anchors or anyone who's

201
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,199
watched this talk okay I see one and a

202
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,150
half hand

203
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,050
I'll find out how the half works later

204
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:07,240
um so essentially they're talk wintered

205
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,550
on the logic that said attackers can

206
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,860
break into your network but make sure

207
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,530
that they can't steal stuff on your

208
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,630
network to use your data they've got to

209
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,390
use it on your network so they

210
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,030
introduced an intermediary on their

211
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,100
network so that if you break in you've

212
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,740
got to talk to the intermediary to get

213
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,560
your data out um it's not terribly

214
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,000
sophisticated but two things are super

215
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,589
interesting about it and one of them is

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,240
traditionally security people just stood

217
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,060
in the corner and told everyone what

218
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,340
they can and can't do but it's square

219
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,099
their security people are writing code

220
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,310
that's in line with every transaction

221
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,320
that Square transacts with okay so you

222
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,660
don't have security people just telling

223
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,600
people no you have your security teams

224
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,670
actually building the code that everyone

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
is running the other thing that was

226
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,300
super interesting about their talk is

227
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,390
they point out that once you build

228
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,819
infrastructure you start to find other

229
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,250
uses for it that you didn't know you had

230
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,590
when you started okay so you start to

231
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,660
see this accumulation of value in the

232
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,030
organization you build it for one reason

233
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,780
and then you find other reasons that

234
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:22,270
make it worthwhile um next to him is

235
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,880
John Flynn um so John Flynn who's now

236
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:28,210
deceased so it over gave a talk when he

237
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,670
was working at Facebook and he gave a

238
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,920
talk on how they built their two-factor

239
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,839
authentication system or the show of

240
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,140
hands how many people here are still

241
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,740
struggling to get to FA MFA into their

242
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,230
orcs everybody got it everyone sorted

243
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,560
okay there's a few people's hands up if

244
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,750
you watch this talk you'll see the part

245
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,849
that John and them went down at Facebook

246
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,580
where they introduced the system so they

247
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,520
went with geo and you big E's and then

248
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,280
for the whole talk he goes through

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,770
series of we did this and it wasn't good

250
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,470
enough we did this we needed to make it

251
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,660
faster we did this and then we optimized

252
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,810
it way down to the point where they

253
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,530
customized do they customized SSH and

254
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,810
now it's faster to authenticate using

255
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,060
two-factor authentication at Facebook

256
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,489
than it is to not use two-factor

257
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,949
authentication at Facebook so now you

258
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,620
have all the developers authenticating

259
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,680
not because it's more secure but because

260
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,990
it's faster it also happens to be more

261
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,020
secure okay so you starting to see the

262
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,750
value that developers actually bring at

263
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,840
the bottom um you see Netflix and slack

264
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,600
again great security teams both putting

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,550
out tons of tools out into the public

266
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,630
how many of you here have started

267
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:51,209
playing with ebps anyone so if you've

268
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,790
got Linux boxes at this point it's tough

269
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:57,270
you should be looking at the guys at

270
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:00,599
Netflix recently pointed out that them

271
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,939
they have something like 40 ebps scripts

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,760
running on their servers Facebook have

273
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,040
something like 15 what's interesting is

274
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,150
none of these people are saying yes we

275
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
running CrowdStrike

276
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,439
they weren't saying yes we running

277
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,800
carbon black what they saying is yes

278
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,530
every server that we have runs custom eb

279
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,510
PF scripts that we wrote and that's how

280
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,030
we're doing the real-time detection on

281
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,569
our servers okay it's a complete mind

282
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:29,850
shift from let's just buy stuff - lets

283
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,430
both stuff in our ops that we know works

284
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,250
and and one of the things that you seen

285
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:38,040
from all of this is like it's my

286
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,740
contention that it's the best time ever

287
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,110
to be working as a defender of a network

288
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,240
okay for a long time if you were

289
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,420
defender on a network it kind of sucked

290
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,530
the cool activity was the guys doing the

291
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,990
red team what i absolutely start my

292
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:57,270
career right now defense at an

293
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,640
organization is absolutely where you

294
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,319
want to be like all of us got into

295
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,660
pentesting because we thought that's

296
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,010
where the hard problems were it turns

297
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,880
out it's not that hard

298
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,660
most people are just broken the question

299
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
is whether you

300
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,650
actually defend stuff and stop defending

301
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,350
stuff at scale

302
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:20,610
they're super interesting problems to be

303
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,920
solved working in defense so I said I'd

304
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,960
take two things um the other thing I

305
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,540
want to talk about is something personal

306
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,750
which is something that we bought gold

307
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,870
canary tokens I'm not sure how many of

308
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,780
you have ever seen this it's free so

309
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,710
we're not trying to sell you anything

310
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,720
something that's interesting about

311
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,360
canary tokens and the reason why why I

312
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,880
want to discuss it here is canary tokens

313
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,950
is one of the dumbest pieces of software

314
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,920
you're likely to find on the Internet

315
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,990
it's really not clever at all I bought

316
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,110
the first version of it in a weekend

317
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,110
here in Doha okay and if we look at the

318
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:02,220
simple wave that canary tokens works you

319
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:06,060
go to it we take the web bug I put in an

320
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,580
email address I put in a reminder like

321
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,150
in the site in this case besides demo

322
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,520
and I say create your token and it comes

323
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,640
back and it gives me some sort of URL

324
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,310
and the logic here is I put that URL

325
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,910
somewhere when some attacker visits it

326
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:26,719
he gets nothing and I get an alert that

327
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,699
tells me somebody just visited this URL

328
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,000
all of you here should be able to see

329
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:36,240
how that works right it's super dumb you

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,850
create a random URL you save it with the

331
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,820
reminder when someone visits that URL

332
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:45,420
you tell the person what the reminder is

333
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,550
right it's completely remedial and the

334
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,719
second remedial thing is you can do the

335
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:55,140
same for DNS right so someone visits you

336
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,170
we take the email address we take the

337
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,500
memo and we give them back a DNS

338
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,620
hostname and if someone looks up the DNS

339
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,020
hostname we'll give them an alert saying

340
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,100
somebody just looked up this DNS name

341
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:14,130
again it's ridiculously stupid okay

342
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,350
nothing intelligent about it but what's

343
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,449
interesting is we built this thing and

344
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,129
we put it out in the world

345
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,959
and the first thing that started

346
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,790
happening is people in our team said

347
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,429
hold on if someone's going to visit your

348
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,248
link we can run stuff in their browser

349
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:32,160
so instead of just telling you the IP

350
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:34,619
that visited you you can now do locate

351
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,540
the IP you can tell what plugins are

352
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:39,509
running in their browser you can tell if

353
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,429
their browser leaks information and then

354
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,980
someone figured out well if you can do

355
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,970
that for you RL you can embed it in a

356
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,949
word doc or PDF doc so same logic give

357
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,819
someone the doc the moment they open

358
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:55,979
that doc and alert goes through and then

359
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:58,769
you start to think well hold on if I can

360
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,739
do that for a doc why don't you put

361
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:04,739
macros in the doc and when the macro is

362
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:06,540
run you can alert and give someone a

363
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:09,179
warning that bad stuff is happening and

364
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,730
then cleverer people started adding on

365
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,799
to it so now you can sign a Windows

366
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,859
binary and the moment the binary is

367
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,249
executed you can get an alert or you can

368
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:24,089
get an AWS alert so effectively you

369
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:27,089
visit us we give you a working AWS API

370
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:29,459
key and the moment that API key is used

371
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:33,209
you get a warning telling you that your

372
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:35,459
API key has been used now again the main

373
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:38,039
thing I would point out is this was

374
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:41,219
inherently a really stupid thing a

375
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,859
really simple code thing but once we

376
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,569
built it and shared it smarter people

377
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:49,410
started adding to it

378
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:51,118
in fact some really smart people so for

379
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,850
those of you who don't know Colin Molina

380
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:57,600
he's a really great security researcher

381
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,179
who currently works at square Colin

382
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,879
Mulliner did a thought me work said yeah

383
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:05,339
he did some research where you can embed

384
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,620
these canary tokens inside of binaries

385
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,198
to detect when binaries are being

386
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,869
reverse-engineered the guys had truths

387
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,409
did it and started putting canary tokens

388
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:19,319
inside all of their cars the guys that

389
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:22,289
use UNIX invited me to give a talk about

390
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,839
it and again fundamentally I'm saying I

391
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:27,879
wanted to speak at USENIX my whole life

392
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,429
and the way I got to go there

393
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,550
this is really stupid weekend project

394
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,650
that just took a life on its own and if

395
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,860
actually the reason you're doing this is

396
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,860
to catch real attackers you'll notice

397
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,050
pen testers saying actually if I know

398
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,209
this community tokens on a network it

399
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,750
makes me scared to use anything that I

400
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,180
find and then you'll see cases with

401
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,230
actual attackers or actual companies

402
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,570
finding out that they've been

403
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,060
compromised in this case by Russian

404
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,389
attackers because they're dropped canary

405
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,909
tokens on their network um so at this

406
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,010
point canary tokens on the Internet

407
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,150
have been used something like a quarter

408
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,930
million times

409
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,300
like people get alerts every day and

410
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:17,080
fundamentally it's really simple code

411
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:20,560
the only difference is we did it and we

412
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,840
shared it now when you see this one of

413
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,450
your first thoughts are gonna be yeah

414
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,399
it's different because you did that or

415
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,830
maybe it's different because you built

416
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,740
this thing and got lucky and the truth

417
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,379
is we did get lucky like over the years

418
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,770
we've built and shared lots and lots and

419
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,780
lots of things like I did a search for

420
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,500
this talk in like the first public tool

421
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,590
a released was in 2001 and that was

422
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,920
really ugly Perl script and if you go

423
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:54,490
through you'll see it in 2001 2002 2004

424
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,560
2007 and and what you'll notice is my

425
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,440
early stuff may have been tragically

426
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,590
horrible but over time it got slightly

427
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,080
less done okay and and for that I want

428
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,570
to play you a quick snippet by someone

429
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:11,470
called Ira Glass and hopefully this

430
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,139
actually plays nobody tells people who

431
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,870
are beginners and I really were somebody

432
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,430
had told this to me is that um all of us

433
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,780
who do creative work like you know we

434
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,490
get into it and we get into it because

435
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,200
we have good taste but it's like there's

436
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,660
a gap that for the first couple years

437
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,550
that you're making stuff what you're

438
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,650
making isn't so good okay it's not that

439
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,760
great it's it's trying to be good it has

440
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,250
ambition too good but it's not quite

441
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,480
that good but your taste the thing that

442
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,520
got you into the game your look your

443
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,020
taste is still killer and your taste is

444
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,310
good enough that you can tell that what

445
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,720
you're making is kind of a

446
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,190
disappointment to you you know what I

447
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,509
mean

448
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,309
people never get past that phase a lot

449
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,259
of people at that point they quit and

450
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,350
the thing I would just like say to you

451
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:52,840
with all my heart is that most everybody

452
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,449
I know who does interesting creative

453
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,490
work they went through a phase of years

454
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,809
where they had really good taste they

455
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,980
could tell what they were making wasn't

456
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,200
as good as they wanted it to be they

457
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,850
knew it felt short it didn't have this

458
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,220
special thing that we wanted it to have

459
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,139
and the thing I would tell you is

460
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,279
everybody goes through that and for you

461
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,629
to go through it if you're going through

462
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,820
right now if you're just getting out of

463
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:15,039
that phase you got to know it's totally

464
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,840
normal and the most important possible

465
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,149
thing you could do is do a lot of work

466
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,830
do a huge volume of work put yourself on

467
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,149
a deadline so that every week or every

468
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,699
month you know you're going to finish

469
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,500
one story because it's only by actually

470
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,120
going through a volume of work that

471
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,580
you're actually going to catch up and

472
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,289
close that gap and you're the work

473
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,620
you're making will be as good as your

474
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:39,009
ambitions in my case like I I took

475
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,559
longer to figure out how to do this than

476
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:43,419
anybody I've ever met

477
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,340
it takes a while it's going to take you

478
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,379
a while it's normal to take a while and

479
00:20:45,340 --> 00:21:15,519
you just have to fight your way through

480
00:20:47,379 --> 00:21:17,168
that okay and if you take like I'm from

481
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,139
South Africa I can't think of a single

482
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:24,370
South African software company that that

483
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:28,709
is worth mention I can't think of too

484
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:33,219
many from the region why don't we um and

485
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:35,279
I'll take a break we'll go and try to

486
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,370
answer this in a long roundabout way

487
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:41,769
Mike to talk a little bit about the book

488
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,158
that I read last year that I absolutely

489
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:47,799
loved if you haven't read this book you

490
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,879
should totally check it out um so so

491
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:54,570
this book is by the guy who led the team

492
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:57,269
that landed the Mars rover

493
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,220
the second Mars rover it's a great book

494
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:02,399
that talks about technical challenges

495
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,830
and how to lead technical teams and and

496
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,360
one of the great things when you go

497
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,740
through this book so we're not going to

498
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,039
get a chance to watch this whole video

499
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,980
but but one of the great things when you

500
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,139
watch this is you see that these guys

501
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,019
had to deal with the really impossible

502
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:21,840
physics right they landing a parachute

503
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,450
in Mars atmosphere where there's no

504
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,459
atmosphere and then they've got to land

505
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,919
on terrain that they don't understand

506
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,720
and then like everything is different

507
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,840
the speed that you're entering what

508
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,539
means that no parachute holds up the

509
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,389
heat shields get destroyed they don't

510
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:42,240
know what land is gonna look like and

511
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:45,029
they come up with this ridiculous Train

512
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,429
idea that says they'll have this thing

513
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:50,460
hover and then a train will actually

514
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:54,350
lower the car and that's how Mars rover

515
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,899
eventually lands on Mars and at the time

516
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:00,570
Adam steltzner worked for JPL the Jet

517
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:03,719
Propulsion laboratories and the book is

518
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,970
great but the interesting thing is that

519
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,230
if you read the book it ends up making

520
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:13,169
you really sad and the reason it makes

521
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,559
you really sad is you hit a point where

522
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:19,409
you realize that that's reserved just

523
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,980
for few countries in the world like if

524
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:25,500
you study physics or engineering you're

525
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,649
not gonna do the sort of physics or

526
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,320
engineering that has problems that have

527
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:34,139
never been solved before like they get

528
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,230
to do because they're working at JPL

529
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:39,149
I'm born South African that's just never

530
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,840
gonna be mine I can't work on rockets

531
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:46,049
for the US unless I unless I change and

532
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,939
and when you see that JPL was formed in

533
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,340
the thirties and are working on all

534
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,610
these incredible problems that we'll

535
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,959
never get to work on so so our students

536
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,389
studied physics and they study

537
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,580
engineering and they graduate but they

538
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:00,429
just never gonna get a chance to jump on

539
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,520
those sorts

540
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:06,970
problems and the good thing about that

541
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,980
is that software is so different right

542
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,400
because if if you're doing software

543
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,740
today um you have a MacBook just like

544
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,080
anyone else in Silicon Valley you're

545
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,120
reading the same books as anyone in

546
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,699
Silicon Valley you've got the same

547
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,340
internet you can even study the same

548
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,320
course where if in fact if you start

549
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,480
your company today you're probably

550
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,899
building it on exactly the same

551
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,100
infrastructure as other US startups are

552
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,850
being built so why don't we build great

553
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,620
software or great software companies if

554
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:47,139
we as smart and have the same

555
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:52,469
infrastructure why don't we um anyone

556
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,470
have want to take the chance anyone

557
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,320
that's a good answer nobody wants to put

558
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:03,960
their neck on the line it's so I'll get

559
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,370
to just about the same conclusion like

560
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,530
putting your neck on the line is is big

561
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,449
and one of the reasons that we should

562
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,190
knock off really quickly because this

563
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,700
comes up anytime anyone talks about

564
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:20,040
Silicon Valley is we don't have access

565
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,960
to their venture capital because

566
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,450
everyone knows Silicon Valley is full of

567
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,990
venture capitalists ready to fund or

568
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,000
whatever ridiculous juseyo idea you have

569
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:33,180
and I just don't think that that's true

570
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,630
um in fact if you look at really really

571
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,640
great companies created over the years

572
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,280
you'll find that funding isn't always a

573
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,060
requirement like Microsoft with their

574
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,750
current 1.2 trillion market cap only

575
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:51,810
raised about a million dollars um Apple

576
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,780
raised about three a company like

577
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:59,370
MailChimp is currently valued at like

578
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:01,770
4.2 billion and they raised nothing like

579
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,320
it's all belongs to the two founders who

580
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,030
started and just not everyone here who

581
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,580
raised their hand and said that they can

582
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,530
program can see how you build a

583
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,120
MailChimp right there's some web

584
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,820
interface stuff there's some sendmail

585
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:19,500
stuff like it's not technically

586
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:24,470
impossible the question is just well why

587
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:29,880
don't we and a simple answer is we don't

588
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:32,550
because we don't largely we've been

589
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,580
trained to become nothing more than

590
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:38,639
consumers we consume the world's

591
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,790
software and and we produce none of it

592
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:47,660
and in part this goes back to a type of

593
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:51,720
colonization where we don't think we can

594
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:55,410
so so really recently Ben Horowitz put

595
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:59,160
out a book called what you do is who you

596
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:01,440
are an essential part of the book that

597
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,280
he keeps talking about is Toussaint

598
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,400
L'Ouverture

599
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:09,060
who led the first Hey

600
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,520
slave revolution and one of the things

601
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:15,389
that he keeps talking about in the book

602
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,670
is how most slave revolutions fail in

603
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,190
fact he claims that all slave

604
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,770
revolutions failed over the years and

605
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,900
the reason he gives for this or the

606
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,170
reason that's given for this is because

607
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,510
slaves have had their thinking changed

608
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,210
so that they they don't think

609
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:36,810
overthrowing their masters is possible

610
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,630
but be when they do they behave badly

611
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:42,060
because slaves have been trained not to

612
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,340
plan for tomorrow a slave gets what he

613
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,020
can he takes it now there's no tomorrow

614
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,320
he's not allowed possessions

615
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,060
so so given the choice between ratting

616
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,490
out someone today and getting a meal

617
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,510
first maybe that guy and I can pull the

618
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,060
country tomorrow

619
00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:01,080
you rat him out and take your meal and

620
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:04,230
this type of this type of thinking is

621
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,439
well studied as coming through when

622
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:10,170
you've been colonized too for anyone

623
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,770
here who's done any sort of pen testing

624
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:16,170
this this is the latest cyber scape that

625
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,360
came out there's something like 3,000

626
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,970
security products in the world today or

627
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,550
companies in the world today how many of

628
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,460
you here do pen testing um quick show of

629
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:31,350
hands how many of you get stopped by any

630
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:34,500
corporate product ever right you'll see

631
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:37,740
nobody like like I stopped pen testing

632
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,410
years ago but no product ever slowed us

633
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,570
down like not even a speed bump so

634
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:46,230
you've got all these products that we

635
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:49,250
all know suck okay and we okay with them

636
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,990
sucking like somehow we tolerate that

637
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,900
but when it comes to software we wanna

638
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:58,590
build and we just don't think it can be

639
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,740
done and what's worse is we see this in

640
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:04,830
two ways we don't think we can do it and

641
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,290
we also don't think people who are like

642
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,720
us can do it so we'll happily buy

643
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,629
software if it's made in San Francisco

644
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,730
we just won't buy a software if it's

645
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,039
made down the street because it's

646
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:21,460
unlikely to be very good

647
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,679
in 2018 um there was this thread that

648
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,830
went on total I'm not sure how many of

649
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,249
you saw it but someone started tweeting

650
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,519
about the insights of Tesla so

651
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:35,049
apparently some guy who worked at Tesla

652
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,249
started writing about the state of the

653
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:41,799
Tesla network and it's a dog show right

654
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:46,600
like it's terrible like OpenVPN

655
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:49,809
unpatched won two boxes guys SS aging

656
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,480
into cars to reboot them because matches

657
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:56,649
haven't been applied and this guy went

658
00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:00,249
on for pages and pages of just how

659
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:03,748
terrible the state of a boon to software

660
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:06,909
or the state of Tesla's software is and

661
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:09,669
what's interesting is a whole bunch of

662
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:13,049
really experienced security people and

663
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,279
deaf people came back these are all just

664
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:18,039
complaints about the state of Tesla's

665
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,259
software and then probably one of the

666
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:24,340
most famous hackers in the world much

667
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:26,850
came back and said dear world that's

668
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,009
right like software sucks

669
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:34,178
and what's interesting is I'm not saying

670
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:36,879
it in this case to say hey this is scary

671
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:41,039
I'm taking it to say yes

672
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:44,469
software is bad like all software is bad

673
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:48,970
the question is why do we think our

674
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:51,249
software is worse last month Chris

675
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,919
Anderson um he used to be the chief

676
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:56,710
editor of Wired was complaining about

677
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,590
the thing that journalists get wrong and

678
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,980
what he said was when journalists cover

679
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,840
tech companies they often report on how

680
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,629
terrible things are but what they don't

681
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,320
realize is everyone's company is

682
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:10,689
terrible

683
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,840
like you don't you don't think Google is

684
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,119
especially bad they all bear and and

685
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,019
again what's interesting is if you

686
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:23,860
compare them if you compare Doha and San

687
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:27,940
Francisco my technical friends in both

688
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,490
places know that software is bad but in

689
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,790
San Fran

690
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,280
sisqó people go yes it's bad let's build

691
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:37,490
our thing because hey we should be able

692
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,800
to do better and down here we go it's

693
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:43,460
bad let's throw it out and buy another

694
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,740
one okay and and fundamentally the guys

695
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,710
who are in the game trying are gonna

696
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:51,080
iterate and get better over time and we

697
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,040
just buy new stuff and we're gonna be

698
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,919
standing in the same spot but there's

699
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:02,420
good news and the good news is that

700
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:06,320
while JPL needs 15 billion over three

701
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:09,559
years to run building software costs you

702
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,280
almost nothing certainly compared to

703
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:17,660
fifteen billion US dollars and the

704
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:21,230
question then is how and answer is we

705
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,990
just have to start we just have to start

706
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,540
believing more in ourselves and

707
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:30,530
believing that actually building stuff

708
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:34,428
has value and and one of the good things

709
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:37,610
is the other way so clearly hasn't

710
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:40,280
worked like buying McAfee or buying

711
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,889
Symantec stuff has done nothing to help

712
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,440
keep our network secure like at this

713
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,990
point you might as well try building it

714
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,090
because the other stuff was rubbish okay

715
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,760
you can't do too much worse than the

716
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,760
rubbish position we've ended up in if

717
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,240
that's not tight enough I'll say as my

718
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,820
conclusion um you gotta start with being

719
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,760
honest with ourselves okay and and by

720
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:07,159
this I mean you have to actually look at

721
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,800
ourselves and say yes we've become just

722
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,890
the consumers of the world and and for

723
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,720
that we completely a transom so so we

724
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,090
can't put forward alternatives to

725
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,720
anything um just because it's almost

726
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,070
impossible to give a talk without this

727
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,260
there's a paper called you and your

728
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:27,260
research by Richard Hamming you

729
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,450
absolutely have to read if you do any

730
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,030
sort of security or any type of research

731
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,309
um you should read this paper and and

732
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,889
one of the interesting things here is

733
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:38,840
Richard Hamming starts right at the

734
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,510
beginning saying well how did I do this

735
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,799
study he says I worked with tape people

736
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,139
I

737
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:46,869
with Beth I worked with with Fineman and

738
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:49,719
I saw that I was a stooge but what's

739
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:52,178
interesting is you notice hemming

740
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,929
actually stopping and taking honest

741
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:58,080
account of himself okay going actually

742
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:01,720
where do I fit into this picture

743
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,739
secondly um we need to be kinder to each

744
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,349
other I've seen tons and tons of times

745
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:11,879
in Doha in South Africa it happens a lot

746
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:15,549
when you become consumers of Technology

747
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:18,328
where people absolutely snipe at each

748
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:22,270
other to show why software is rubbish

749
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:24,359
again yes it's rubbish you work around

750
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,969
it to make it fit for your organization

751
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:31,779
for that I want a reference but won't

752
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:35,439
keep on screen you should read enter on

753
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:38,230
ego speech from ratatouille and the main

754
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,129
thing that that entered ego puts a trust

755
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,250
here is that the new needs friends it's

756
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:48,308
really easy to criticize criticism is

757
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,379
worth very little most times your

758
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:53,139
criticism is worth less than the piece

759
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:56,049
of junk you criticizing what actually

760
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,140
needs friends is new things um give it a

761
00:34:56,049 --> 00:35:02,079
try

762
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,290
we should look over the wall this is an

763
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,440
odd one um so Sharif was right we have a

764
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,900
really nice ecosystem here but one of

765
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,010
the things we should all be careful of

766
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:17,349
is measuring ourselves or or setting our

767
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,119
limits just with the people near us

768
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:21,510
one of the benefits that the internet

769
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,089
gives us is that we can completely

770
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:27,970
measure ourselves or grow according to

771
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:30,819
the people on the internet right so if

772
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,970
everyone next to you thinks that the

773
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,180
highest aspiration should be whether you

774
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:39,279
install CrowdStrike or carbon black

775
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,990
don't compare yourselves to them compare

776
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,660
yourselves to the people working at

777
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:46,899
Netflix who are deciding how to use a

778
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,720
BPF to secure all of their servers okay

779
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,580
the Internet allows us to choose who our

780
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:57,000
peers are make your choice

781
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:00,210
and then lastly just make more stuff

782
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,440
it'll suck at the beginning but it'll

783
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:07,320
get better at this point I'll stop for

784
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,510
questions like I promised I would I'm

785
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,570
how to meet on Twitter so you get tweet

786
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:48,080
and tell me why I'm ridiculous or we can

787
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:56,940
take questions now anyone anyone and

788
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:58,830
building building yeah so it's a good

789
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,020
question so the question is building

790
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,779
takes time how do you find the right

791
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,920
balance between building and and buying

792
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:11,490
and and the answer is you don't always

793
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,160
just build it because you want to build

794
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,890
it if a good solution exists for sure

795
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,649
use the good solution when you look at a

796
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:23,069
forest talk John Flynn's talk for - FAQ

797
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,970
he started off immediately with Geo and

798
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,590
you begin

799
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,930
he said because this solution needs to

800
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,940
go into model and so the first thing he

801
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,160
did was he put in the paid solution and

802
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,530
then he whittled it down and went now we

803
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,710
can shave time of this now we can make

804
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:40,620
it quicker now we can get SSH patches so

805
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,990
I'm totally a huge fan of making sure

806
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,690
that the stuff you build makes your

807
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:48,450
users happy and if you take too long you

808
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,220
won't make your users happy um so so the

809
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,609
answer is I'm not saying you have to

810
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,649
pull rewrite your own operating systems

811
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,210
I'm saying we need to keep it as an

812
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:03,260
alternative because it's not something

813
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:03,260
we do enough of anyone else

814
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:11,429
