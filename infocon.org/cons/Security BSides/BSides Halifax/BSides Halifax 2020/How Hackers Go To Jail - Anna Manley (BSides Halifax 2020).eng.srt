the community by bringing this all

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,550
together again I'm gonna stop rambling

31
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,429
and quickly introduce Anna Manley she's

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,830
our keynote speaker for the day she is

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,080
the principal lawyer at Manly law Inc

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:38,460
she's a internet and privacy lawyer

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:43,050
based in Sydney Nova Scotia Anna I'm

36
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,399
gonna pass it over to you right now all

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,990
right thank you very much I didn't

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,160
I didn't commit the sin of being muted

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,809
and trying to speak I've done that

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,880
multiple times throughout this this

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,620
whole thing so thank you very much for

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,890
having me everybody this is uh I know

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,820
it's kind of an odd thing but I actually

44
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,520
think this is gonna work out okay

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,839
because you can see my owl which is

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,890
which is cool so you're actually seeing

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,500
the inside of my office

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,639
so what-what I want to talk about today

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,899
is the ways in which hackers go to jail

50
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,600
and I'm gonna talk about what that means

51
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,220
in a second but I kind of feel like I've

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,510
pulled off some kind of military coup on

53
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,320
a zoom call and now you have to all

54
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,420
listen to me Baha so but before before I

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,519
do that and go into launch into this

56
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,799
talk I want to issue a disclaimer it's

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,110
my classic disclaimer I'm a lawyer but

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,110
nothing nothing in these slides

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,570
constitutes legal advice even if it was

60
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,770
it would very heavily rely on the words

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,829
it depends and we all know that that's

62
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,450
kind of the usual lawyer thing most as

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,520
with most areas of law this is a

64
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,780
complicated issue we're going to talk

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,690
and get into a lot of complicated

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,100
concepts a very high level and I would

67
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,900
need to know the specifics of any

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,920
situation before I can actually provide

69
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,989
a legal opinion all right so I've talked

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,488
to this community a lot about the

71
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,400
various hacking offenses under the

72
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,590
Criminal Code and also how hacking

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,570
crimes are handled in the u.s. we've

74
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,690
explored a lot of different concepts in

75
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,730
terms of how like how people are charged

76
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,550
what what provisions are charged under

77
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,488
and my summary is always that hacking is

78
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,489
really illegal it just is it's kind of

79
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,800
this this mixture of just a regular

80
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,930
crime in that you can even steal data

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,430
and you can access like kind of like a

82
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,500
breaking and entering at unauthorized

83
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,410
use of the computer but it's also a

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,330
mixed regular crime and political crime

85
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,400
as well as we'll talk about a little bit

86
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,380
as we get into to some of these issues

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,200
but I've never actually talked about

88
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,810
what happens when these offenses bill

89
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,670
beyond the arrest phase and so how do

90
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,799
prosecutors prove a person have to

91
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,910
computer what type of evidence is used

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,530
and how is electronic evidence different

93
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,700
how do you handle prosecuting

94
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,430
individuals when the world looks like

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,220
this and someone from here commits a

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,870
crime against someone Oh

97
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,070
here I don't know why I picked Vancouver

98
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,380
Island actually I think I pick you in

99
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,140
Coover um apparently there's there's

100
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,150
some kind of hotbed in my mind so but

101
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,649
also how do you explain to a 70 year old

102
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,500
judge who walked the earth when

103
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,150
computers look like this how all of this

104
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,130
works how do you explain these concepts

105
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,600
to them now as an interesting side note

106
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:22,010
this is the pilot AC II circa 1950 it

107
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,650
was constructed the National Physical

108
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,110
Laboratory in Britain and it could

109
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,870
impact eight eight hundred vacuum tubes

110
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:33,530
into twelve square feet so it was it was

111
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,720
not exactly a laptop so what I should

112
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,950
have called this talk is I should have

113
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,690
called it story time

114
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,849
with Anna okay so we're going to look at

115
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,160
how hackers go to jail and what these

116
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,710
prosecutions look like in the real world

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,810
by looking at the case law okay that's

118
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,549
that's how lawyers and judges operate we

119
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,010
look at how previous cases have been

120
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,410
handled and apply that logic to the

121
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,730
current case but even before I do that

122
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,800
and I feel like there's a lot of

123
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,240
preamble here but first I want to give

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,090
you some insight into my creative

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,780
process so I start with an idea and I

126
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,599
come up with a working title I slap some

127
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,580
legal legal concepts on that ad cat

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,840
photos of proof I have a talk okay so

129
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,650
that's that's basically what I've done

130
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,270
here so one of the cases I want to start

131
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,659
with is Gary McKinnon

132
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,299
also known as solo so it may seem like

133
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,970
this was was ages ago but there have

134
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,650
been kind of recent ish developments in

135
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,400
terms of this area of law

136
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,440
so MacKinnon was accused in 2002 of

137
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,560
perpetrating the biggest military half

138
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,990
of all time at the time in 2002

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,990
involving 2000 US military computers he

140
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,990
deleted files and interrupted service he

141
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,240
also quite cheaply posted your security

142
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,979
is crap on a military site he tore down

143
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,850
the site and it was just your security

144
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:58,280
is crap and I think I kind of it's kind

145
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,190
of amusing after the UK enacted the

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,260
extradition act in 2003 which change

147
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,750
which changed the standards for how

148
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:10,250
extradition is handled between the u.s.

149
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,930
and the UK the u.s. sought McKinnon's

150
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,910
extradition to the US

151
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,660
and in the US he would have faced up to

152
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,030
70 years in prison and the u.s. the u.s.

153
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,530
his request was initially granted okay

154
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,440
at the initial stage of the extradition

155
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,400
hearing it was it was granted and

156
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,070
MacKinnon appealed to the House of Lords

157
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,799
he argued that the US was using the UK

158
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,110
criminal justice process which does not

159
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,750
include plea bargains to bully him into

160
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,419
pleading guilty in the u.s. he of course

161
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,910
lost that he appealed to the European

162
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,740
Court of Human Rights he lost he applied

163
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,750
to the High Court for a judicial review

164
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,639
the extradition judicial review is

165
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,710
basically a fancy way of saying having a

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,139
second look having another judge look at

167
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,320
the process that the previous judge used

168
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,750
he lost that appeal he applied for

169
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,729
judicial review of the evidence relating

170
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,860
to his Asperger's syndrome and other

171
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,508
conditions and whether or not they would

172
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,759
be in or out of his extradition hearing

173
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,970
included or not when I say in RF that's

174
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,190
what I mean and at that point that that

175
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,930
he applied and then the application

176
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,219
didn't actually go to a hearing because

177
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,169
at that point the British government

178
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,830
stepped in and blocked the extradition

179
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:20,448
they cited his medical conditions and

180
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,820
also a desire to preserve his human

181
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,979
rights they of course reserve the right

182
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,490
to prosecute him in the UK did they do

183
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,740
that no they did not the Director of

184
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,770
Public Prosecutions for the UK announced

185
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,330
that MacKinnon would not be prosecuted

186
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,609
due to the difficulty in bringing

187
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,400
evidence against him this was a hack on

188
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,139
US military computers and the US wasn't

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
exactly going to be forthcoming with the

190
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,460
nature of the information impacted by

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,159
the hack or the the methods that

192
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,169
MacKinnon had used to breach into their

193
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:54,620
system so that's the end of that story

194
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:57,680
or was it more recently and this is the

195
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,199
more recent development this UK US

196
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,110
extradition drama unfolded for a second

197
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,330
time in the Laurie love case Laurie love

198
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,039
was charged with hacking US agencies and

199
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,460
stealing huge amounts of data between

200
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,770
2012 and 2013 after going through the

201
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,690
various trial and appeals stages the

202
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,698
extradition application was denied by

203
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,889
the High Court in 2018 the court found

204
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,260
that love's extradition to the US would

205
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,419
be oppressive because and that's the

206
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,760
word they used oppressive because he has

207
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,979
Asperger's syndrome and other conditions

208
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,230
to have a higher risk than normal of

209
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,750
suicided extradited to the US in fact he

210
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,150
stated it put in evidence through his

211
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,630
testimony that he would likely commit

212
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:43,159
suicide if extradited to the US so he

213
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:45,950
was not prosecuted in the US so the love

214
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,800
and MacKinnon cases highlight a major

215
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,560
hurdle in prosecuting cybercrime and

216
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,750
that hurdle is jurisdiction and this is

217
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,229
a fancy way of saying whose problem is

218
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:00,140
this alright jurisdiction is an

219
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,480
incredibly complex legal concept both in

220
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,130
theory and practice and we're just going

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,590
to talk kind of brush the surface of it

222
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,180
because I do not want to bore you so

223
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,710
when we want to make a person in one

224
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,810
jurisdiction subject to the laws of

225
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,000
another jurisdiction we either have to

226
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,390
import the laws from that other

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,040
jurisdiction which is kind of a topic

228
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,550
for another time and by another time I

229
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,110
mean never

230
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,870
I would I would never do that to you

231
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,060
that would be incredibly boring or the

232
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,610
other option is to move the person to

233
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,180
that country where the laws were trying

234
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,800
to apply are okay but when we think

235
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,329
about extradition what I don't I mean

236
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,859
people talk about it often like oh you

237
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,660
know we have an extradition treaty oh

238
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,910
I'm gonna go to Russia because we don't

239
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,069
have an extradition treaty with them but

240
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,839
no one ever really thinks about the

241
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,000
fundamental essence of jurisdiction of

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,320
what it actually means and what

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,380
extradition rather and what it actually

244
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,810
means because extradition is at it's

245
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:58,070
very core a request from one country to

246
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,689
another country for a for a person in

247
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,850
that country to become subject to the

248
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,280
laws of another country regardless of

249
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,110
the fact that that person never may have

250
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,110
never voted for those laws and may never

251
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,340
even have stepped foot in that country

252
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,930
so it sounds kind of gross when you say

253
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,870
it that way and that's why we have

254
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,550
actually quite robust systems in

255
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,830
relation to jurists in relation to

256
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,620
extradition and whether or not we allow

257
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,270
that transport of human being from one

258
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,470
country to another to stand trial in

259
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:29,480
another country to be allowed and we do

260
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,880
have extradition treaties we have one

261
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,950
with the US of course and this process

262
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,420
is outlined in those extradition

263
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,190
treaties but also in our laws and

264
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,709
candidates called the extradition act

265
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,230
and this is an overview

266
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,570
of that extradition process don't read

267
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,740
it it's really just a helpful graphic

268
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,630
this is actually a graphic that was

269
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,940
prepared by the Department of Justice so

270
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,950
there are three phases at phase one the

271
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,690
Department of Justice receives a request

272
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,030
from a foreign government with whom

273
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,650
Canada has an extradition treaty let's

274
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,560
use the US as an example they're an easy

275
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:03,590
one and also a very politically

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,439
prescient one if the person is arrested

277
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:09,890
already the request is for removal to

278
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,690
the US - okay just they're already in

279
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,340
custody the request is okay you have

280
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,320
this arrested person we want you to move

281
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,180
the accused to the US if the person is

282
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,580
not yet arrested then the request

283
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,930
includes a request for the Canadian

284
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,940
authorities to go and pick that person

285
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,189
up so that they can be subject to an

286
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,100
extradition hearing to be removed to the

287
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,050
US and an arrest can happen at any stage

288
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,580
but it can happen very early on in this

289
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,890
process it can actually be the initial

290
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,580
stage of the extradition process in

291
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,370
Canada

292
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,990
so the requirements for under the

293
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,790
extradition act include reviewing the

294
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,160
offense involved and determining whether

295
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,689
or not it would have resulted in a jail

296
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,910
sentence of two years or more had it

297
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,420
taken place in Canada extradition is

298
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,100
only is reserved for serious offenses so

299
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,069
offenses that would be more two years or

300
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,140
more because we don't want to be going

301
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:00,170
through this incredibly expensive and

302
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,460
onerous process for set for sentences

303
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,069
that aren't actually that serious for

304
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,330
offenses that aren't that serious the

305
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,640
second question is whether or not the

306
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,010
contact the the conduct which is the

307
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,900
subject of the extradition is considered

308
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,200
criminal in both Canada in the US so

309
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,650
this is known as dual criminality so

310
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,880
then when we move on to the second phase

311
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,430
this is where the judge actually gets

312
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,990
involved so the initial phase is and

313
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,699
it's called the authority to proceed

314
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,100
because it really is just are we getting

315
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,300
this started is can we even get past can

316
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,000
we even get out of the gate on the

317
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,740
extradition process phase two is where

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,660
these matters actually come before a

319
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,000
judge and a judge makes a decision on

320
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,040
some on two questions okay the first

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,220
question is is is there sufficient

322
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,410
evidence for trial in Canada so if this

323
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,990
crime happened in Canada if we were

324
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,850
prosecuting it here all the evidence

325
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,010
that the foreign government is putting

326
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,860
forward if that were the evidence in

327
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,780
Canada would that

328
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,820
would that be enough evidence for trial

329
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,089
so not would they be convicted in Canada

330
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,760
but would it be that bare minimum enough

331
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:08,650
for a trial okay the second question is

332
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,410
is that activity a crime in Canada so

333
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,060
for example we don't extradite people to

334
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,300
countries where they will be punished

335
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,189
for homosexuality nor do we extradite

336
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,410
people for the purpose of interrogation

337
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,310
those are some some hard limits that we

338
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,530
have here in Canada phase three is the

339
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,989
political phase alright this is the

340
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,610
phase where the Minister of Justice

341
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,290
decides whether or not extradition will

342
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,350
go through whether or not to surrender

343
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,390
that's the word they use the person to

344
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,010
the requesting country and the

345
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,990
extradition Act sets out a series of

346
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,150
mandatory and discretionary grounds for

347
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,880
refusal of surrender so mandatory

348
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,550
grounds for refusing surrender a person

349
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,790
include whether or not surrender would

350
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,349
be unjust or oppressive remember

351
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,910
MacKinnon and love where they both had

352
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,780
medical conditions they both actually

353
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,069
had Asperger's syndrome notably and the

354
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,900
extradition was found that it would be

355
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,200
oppressive to them because the US system

356
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,910
would not be would not accommodate those

357
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,880
conditions appropriately it's not set up

358
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,980
for that more on that in a second um or

359
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,150
if it was made on the basis of a ground

360
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,920
of discrimination so for example the US

361
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,380
has a prison population that is largely

362
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,729
African American so that's an issue so

363
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,710
are you coming after this person just

364
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,150
because they're black this is a question

365
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,290
that related comes up in extradition

366
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:32,949
hearings Muslim is also a more recent

367
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:35,349
ground for denying extradition so the

368
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,880
minister must be must also refuse

369
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,230
surrender and where the consequences of

370
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
surrender would be contrary to the

371
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,910
principles of fundamental justice under

372
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,460
Section 7 of the Charter or in the case

373
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,010
of a Canadian citizen would be their

374
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,420
rights will be unjustly infringed and it

375
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,490
would undress infringe their right to

376
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,240
remain in Canada which is also

377
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,850
guaranteed by the Charter so in terms of

378
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,350
the the process that we go through you

379
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,910
can actually see that it's it's quite

380
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,080
robust because you would need to make

381
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,110
sure that the people that are in your

382
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,740
country whether citizens or not who have

383
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,070
the benefit

384
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,780
it of the protection of the democratic

385
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,210
and justice systems that you've put in

386
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,069
place continue to have that benefit and

387
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,680
have that benefit even if someone is

388
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:21,670
requesting to remove them so the process

389
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,530
is robust but it has some issues and as

390
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,339
an interesting side note this is article

391
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,990
6 of the canada-us extradition treaty it

392
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,840
covers extradition for offenses

393
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,060
punishable by death in the u.s. in

394
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,410
summary and I'm sure you've already read

395
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,479
through it already but in summary a

396
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,819
Canadian citizen can be extradited to

397
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,620
the u.s. to face a death penalty as long

398
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,890
as the u.s. pinky swears the death

399
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,360
penalty won't be carried out so I mean

400
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,280
what when I wrote this actually

401
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,230
discovered this article in the process

402
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,680
of preparing this presentation and of

403
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,720
course this was my reaction so I I

404
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,670
haven't actually I did try to find the

405
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,440
case law regarding this article I was

406
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,209
unable to I don't think that this is

407
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,860
something that Candida does in practice

408
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:07,210
but the fact this article it's it's just

409
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,360
somewhat concerning so the US justice

410
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,550
and prison system has been the subject

411
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,400
of scrutiny regarding their handling of

412
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,810
violence and sexual assaults in

413
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,060
violation of prisoners Eighth Amendment

414
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,780
rights okay that's the right to right

415
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,989
against cruel and unusual punishment so

416
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,240
extradition from a friendlier country to

417
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,550
the US is sometimes difficult because

418
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,310
the evidence supporting this scrutiny is

419
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,589
is well documented and is used pretty

420
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,869
much every extradition hearing in Canada

421
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:41,610
where it's a Canada to US extradition

422
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:44,110
hearing okay sorry so for example

423
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,810
applications for extradition involving

424
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,470
vulnerable minority groups are generally

425
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,150
not approved that's that's running

426
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,880
throughout the case law and has become a

427
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,920
more significant recently and in many

428
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,840
cases country like Canada are extremely

429
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,300
reluctant to extradite citizens to the

430
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,490
u.s. to stand trial due to the concerns

431
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,379
both with the conduct in the criminal

432
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,069
justice system but also with the

433
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,970
conditions inside of prisons and as an

434
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:16,450
interesting sidenote X traditions have

435
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,950
ceased completely in code during Cova

436
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,069
nineteen for obvious reasons we don't

437
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,690
want anyone traveling across

438
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,419
borders to conditions where we don't

439
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:26,480
know how they'll be treated so just

440
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,220
switching gears a little bit this is a

441
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,370
Venus flytrap I'm sure all of you know

442
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,230
how a Venus try flytrap works they wait

443
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,489
for their prey to come to them it's I

444
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,150
think you see where I'm going with this

445
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,420
if the US anticipates extradition of a

446
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,520
particular individual will be difficult

447
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,340
they use the Venus flytrap method they

448
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,200
wait for their prey to come to them say

449
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,030
what you will about the US it's still a

450
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,590
very fun place to go there's a lot of

451
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,030
very interesting things going on there

452
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,159
it is a superpower it's one of the

453
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,129
largest economies in the world a lot of

454
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,760
people want to travel to the US

455
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,880
especially people in the technical

456
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,310
industries so the US has the luxury of

457
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,590
waiting for people to come to them and

458
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,440
they often do and that's what they did

459
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,689
in the case of Marcus Hutchins

460
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,210
he stopped so this is a guy who stopped

461
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,910
want to cry in 2017 he was arrested when

462
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,100
he travelled to the u.s. from the UK for

463
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,870
DEFCON and he was charged with crimes

464
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,179
relating to the creation and sale of

465
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,939
malware programs you pass KITT and

466
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,130
Kronos these are programs that help

467
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,770
steal people's banking information it's

468
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,350
obviously a big no-no there were a total

469
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,720
of ten charges against him his plea deal

470
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:38,179
knock this down to two with the

471
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,920
potential for 10 years in prison now he

472
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,690
didn't actually end up serving any time

473
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,070
for the information that I was able to

474
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,930
find on this honest young man but he did

475
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,210
hacked and he entered in one of those

476
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:55,420
guilty pleas in order to reduce his

477
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:59,300
sentence similarly other other financial

478
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:01,670
hacking sins Bogdan Nicholas Q was part

479
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,050
of a hacker consortium called Bay Rob he

480
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,430
was convicted of stealing over forty

481
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,139
five million dollars from victims all

482
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,570
around the world using a huge network of

483
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,970
malware infected computers he was

484
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,610
arrested in Bucharest and extradited to

485
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,070
the US where he was convicted of 21

486
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,100
charges and was sentenced to 20 years in

487
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,189
prison he attempted a plea deal but was

488
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,300
denied by the prosecution because what

489
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,680
to be honest with you they just wanted

490
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,870
to throw the book at him and make an

491
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,920
example of him alright so he was found

492
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,629
guilty at trial another example of a

493
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,040
guilty plea is what

494
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,840
Jonathan James also known as comrade he

495
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,240
was the first juvenile incarcerated for

496
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,480
a cyber crime in the US ok this was this

497
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,310
was a very long time ago at the age of

498
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,890
15 he hacked into computers at the

499
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,780
defense Threat Reduction agency so this

500
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,000
is a division of the US Department of

501
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:58,730
Defense the ax back door he installed he

502
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,440
10 official US military computers were

503
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,300
involved he copied the international

504
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,880
space station source code from life

505
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,430
support I don't know why he thought this

506
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,040
was a good idea so his house was raided

507
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,170
he pled guilty in exchange for a lenient

508
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,200
sentence of 7 months house arrest and

509
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,930
and probation ending at the age of 18

510
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,950
and he was banned from using computer

511
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,370
computers for recreational purposes for

512
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,740
forever essentially now as a sad ending

513
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,469
to this to Jonathan's story he didn't

514
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,300
kill himself in 2008 at the age of 24

515
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,980
after he was investigated by the US

516
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,260
Secret Service for a cyber attack on

517
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,670
multiple retail companies Jonathan

518
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,070
expressed fear being wrongfully

519
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:44,060
convicted for a crime he didn't commit

520
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,320
he adamantly denied any involvement but

521
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,520
he was investigated because he was

522
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,860
friends with some of the hackers

523
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,260
involved despite the fact that there was

524
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,110
no evidence linking him to the crime so

525
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,580
his is really a cautionary tale it's an

526
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,959
example of the guilty plea but it's a

527
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,360
cautionary tale showing us that some

528
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,310
convictions don't end when your sentence

529
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,709
has been carried out on a lighter note

530
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:08,480
we have an example that's in Canada so

531
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,060
this is a fairly high-profile example

532
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,190
I'm sure many of you recognize this

533
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,780
individual if not the picture then at

534
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,490
least his his hand all mafia boy

535
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,560
so I'm actually I don't think many of

536
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,570
you knew this person was Canadian not

537
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,510
many people know that ice from Montreal

538
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,450
so so Michael Kelsey I believe that's

539
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:32,360
how you say his name was 15 when he shut

540
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,400
down Yahoo for an hour in a in a denial

541
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,820
of service attack he claimed that he did

542
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,030
this to gain notoriety for his for him

543
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,040
in his his cyber group TNT the attack

544
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,620
was a first volley in a competitive

545
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,129
exchange that basically escalated very

546
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,250
quickly

547
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:53,270
and snowballed into catchy shutting down

548
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:55,130
eBay CNN and Amazon so naturally a

549
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,900
manhunt was launched and eventually

550
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,390
kouchi had an unmarked van parked at the

551
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,240
end of his street at 4:00 a.m. he was

552
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,240
arrested at his high school in a display

553
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,940
of force and prosecuted in Canada on 50

554
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,800
counts of unauthorized use of a computer

555
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,660
and various other offenses he was

556
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,409
sentenced to eight months in a youth

557
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,720
group home because he also pled guilty

558
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,390
and as you're all aware he's a white hat

559
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,130
now and I for one firmly believe in the

560
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,250
power of the criminal justice system to

561
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:28,460
reform people so those are my examples

562
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,800
of people who who either attempted to or

563
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,820
did empty ante enter guilty pleas sorry

564
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,830
I'm now these cases highlight a problem

565
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,169
with plea deals in the context of

566
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,929
hacking cases and I'm going to explain

567
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,310
this using lamborghinis because that's a

568
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,560
fun word to say I like to say it's like

569
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,399
the word bubble so when you steal a

570
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,310
Lamborghini

571
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,350
you can only steal one Lamborghini yeah

572
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,810
you can pick up all kinds of other

573
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,790
charges along the way like you know if

574
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,649
you if you use a gun the permission of

575
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,810
the offense if you get a high-speed

576
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,430
chase with police in lumbini that you've

577
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,040
stolen which would basically be

578
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,630
irresistible I think if you have your

579
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,159
drugs on you while you steal the

580
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,360
Lamborghini if you have a large amount

581
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,900
of drugs on you while you steal the

582
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,240
Lamborghini but in terms of the offense

583
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,910
of theft there's only one physical

584
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,070
object you can take it you're charged

585
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,810
with the offense of theft okay in terms

586
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,840
of logistics you can only be in one

587
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,820
place at a time and if you wanted to

588
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,189
steal multiple Lamborghinis you'd have

589
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,189
to go from one swanky house to another

590
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,500
finding Glen Burgin used to take so the

591
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,060
counts of theft would be limited by the

592
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,300
physicality of the deed itself right

593
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,830
your geography the laws of physics

594
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,290
various things so data is different

595
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:48,350
right I mean it's lots of individual

596
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,659
items of potentially high value that can

597
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,510
be stored in one place once you're in

598
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,740
there is no physical limit on how much

599
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,590
you can take

600
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,690
there's also dual offences at once so

601
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,740
unauthorized use of a computer

602
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:06,770
the theft of the data itself all in the

603
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,720
same singular action so in terms of

604
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,610
hacking offenses that counts really RAC

605
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,370
out and they rack up fast so you've

606
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,719
noticed this we we have 5050 charges we

607
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,699
can have hundreds of charges associated

608
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,530
with a single a single attack

609
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,890
so most hacking offenses result in an

610
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:24,230
incredibly high count of charges each of

611
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,620
them carrying their own sentence

612
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,220
potentially okay usually in Canada we we

613
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:33,500
use a very logical reasonable way of

614
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,390
sentencing people where we say look you

615
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,650
know you're in it we're not going to

616
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,390
sentence you to five hundred years

617
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,010
that's ridiculous nobody lives for five

618
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,990
hundred years in the US they do that

619
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,629
because it's a show of force okay it's a

620
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,010
different proof it's a defective so

621
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,320
these counts racking up in these

622
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,210
sentences kind of jumping on to each

623
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,409
other and connecting together means that

624
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,020
the majority of people charged with

625
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,170
hacking offenses are highly motivated to

626
00:24:54,020 --> 00:25:01,420
plead guilty even if there is spotty

627
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:04,340
proof for the actual offense itself and

628
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,980
this leads me to the other problem with

629
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,620
guilty pleas is that lawyers don't who

630
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,500
don't understand the technology involved

631
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,540
in an incredibly complicated criminal

632
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,310
case regarding unauthorized use of a

633
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,530
computer they don't have the ability

634
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,360
defense counsel doesn't have the ability

635
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,860
to poke holes in the mountain of

636
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,300
evidence they get from the prosecution

637
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,040
they don't have the skills to identify

638
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,870
potential areas of weakness in the

639
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,290
Crown's case they don't even know what

640
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,520
questions to ask potentially therefore

641
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,620
they're more likely to encourage a

642
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,300
client to enter a guilty plea based on

643
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,889
the evidence available and also that

644
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,450
lawyers perception of the evidence you

645
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,250
have to remember that defense counsel

646
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,300
are people right I mean they're they're

647
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,250
limited by their knowledge and

648
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,020
experience and although they have a duty

649
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,910
to gain knowledge in an area that

650
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,010
they're attempting to defend somebody

651
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,590
and if they don't have a base of

652
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,060
knowledge or they like I said don't know

653
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,709
what questions to ask it can be very

654
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,750
difficult for them to have that

655
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,060
knowledge to in order to poke those

656
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,550
holes in the prosecution's case which is

657
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,500
absolutely central to deciding whether

658
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,990
or not a guilty plea ought to be entered

659
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,340
okay and it's not because they're bad

660
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,170
lawyers it's because they don't know how

661
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,629
to scrutinize the evidence the

662
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,520
prosecution on the other hand has

663
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,500
special prosecutors handling

664
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,389
our crime in fact one of the special

665
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,679
prosecutors friend of the scotia was

666
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,380
kind enough to assist me with the

667
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,840
material for this chop so even in Nova

668
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,610
Scotia we have these people so we've

669
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,260
talked about extradition and guilty

670
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,659
pleas but what happens when these crimes

671
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,879
actually go to trial we can't talk about

672
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,330
all they have saw the interest interest

673
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,830
of trial I mean it's just it's it would

674
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,300
be incredibly boring you'd all fall

675
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,580
asleep I just want to focus on the

676
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,440
evidence which in and of itself can be

677
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,000
exciting the rules of evidence are

678
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,370
boring so I'm going to try and make them

679
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,620
exciting so how do you go about proving

680
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,320
a cyber attack and I say cyber attack

681
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,909
because I'm not talking about crimes

682
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,100
using computer like possession and

683
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,830
distribution of child pornography which

684
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,809
are lumped into cyber crime that's not

685
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,530
my focus here we're focusing just on

686
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:05,660
hackers at cyber attacks so the problem

687
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,870
with the law of evidence is that its

688
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,660
principles were created at a time when

689
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:14,629
this was the primary source of evidence

690
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,630
the human memory notoriously unreliable

691
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,880
but still the base of all the rules of

692
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,710
evidence most lawyers are trained to

693
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,230
extract relevant pieces of information

694
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,600
from a person's brain or physical

695
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,990
documents the rules have been adapted

696
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:33,230
over time in the cases to grapple with

697
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,850
new technology and we also have enacted

698
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,880
new rules of evidence new statutory

699
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,850
rules of evidence to deal with with

700
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,220
these items so the bulk of evidence

701
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,709
brought against hackers is electronic

702
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,390
documents for obvious reasons the

703
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,070
definition of electronic documents is

704
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,050
broad enough to cover copies of all

705
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,409
documents stored in a computer business

706
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:56,690
records bulletin boards and other social

707
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,220
media and emails tweets are also

708
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,510
included in this definition of

709
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,650
electronic document so you can see that

710
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:06,050
it's a very very broad definition almost

711
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,470
painfully broad because you can see how

712
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:11,659
these these rules of evidence apply to

713
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:15,250
for example a divorce case where people

714
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,990
were exchanging you know nasty insults

715
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,750
over facebook Messenger these the same

716
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:24,470
rules apply to a complicated cyberattack

717
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,440
case which seems very odd but certainly

718
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:30,100
which we try to shoehorn them to make

719
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,679
fit so an electronic document means any

720
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,080
data that is recorded or stored on any

721
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,210
medium in or by a computer system or

722
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,980
other similar device that can be read or

723
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,450
perceived by a person or a computer

724
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,090
system or other similar device and

725
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:46,720
includes a display a printout or other

726
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,678
output of that data and any person

727
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,090
seeking to and this is the more

728
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,190
important part any person seeking to

729
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,620
admit electronic document as an

730
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,289
electronic document as evidence has the

731
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,209
burden of proving the authenticity by

732
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:59,679
evidence capable of supporting a finding

733
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,419
so basically if you're putting something

734
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,029
in if you're putting an electronic

735
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,669
document in as evidence it's on you to

736
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:11,950
prove that it's authentic and there are

737
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:13,950
ways that we do that so this is a good

738
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,600
time for a quick discussion on

739
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,659
admissible atif versus wait and this is

740
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,629
a key difference when we're talking

741
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:25,539
about about evidence coming in or not

742
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:27,129
being in trial so this ability is

743
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:29,350
whether or not a piece of evidence will

744
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:32,199
even be allowed to come into trial even

745
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,519
to be considered and wait isn't it's not

746
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,399
about the bread we've all been eating

747
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,080
during the quarantine it's about whether

748
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,018
it's about whether or not something

749
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,360
should be I should have influenced so if

750
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:47,529
something is it is admissible

751
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:52,449
but lacks credibility it will be said to

752
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:55,419
have less weight all right now expert

753
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,009
evidence is evidence offered by person

754
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,960
with special knowledge in an area

755
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,059
experts are the only people who are

756
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,309
allowed to offer opinions at trial

757
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,470
rather than just stating facts and this

758
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,908
means that because because they have

759
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,070
they're allowed to offer opinions and

760
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:12,309
they're introduced as having a

761
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:15,689
specialized knowledge their evidence has

762
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:18,428
a great deal of weight this means that

763
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:21,549
then being able to offer expert evidence

764
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:24,639
is subject to extreme judicial scrutiny

765
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,590
ok and much argument between lawyers and

766
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:29,350
the judge gets to decide whether or not

767
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,939
a person can offer expert testimony and

768
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,189
whether or not it's even required in

769
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:35,799
that case so an expert will only be able

770
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,440
to allow to be allowed to testify if

771
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,520
they have special skills or exclusive

772
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,890
knowledge

773
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,870
I was decided by the judge and in

774
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,120
hacking prosecution's expert testimony

775
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,219
is used for example to tie an

776
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,409
individual's IP address to the

777
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,870
particular activities they allegedly

778
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,780
engaged in an expert testimony may also

779
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,760
be used by the defense to determine that

780
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,350
the IP address was not at the time of

781
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,060
the activities associated with the

782
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,449
computer belonging to the accused

783
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:07,600
so it can be used by both sides and each

784
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,960
side would have their own expert right

785
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,959
now there's another type of evidence

786
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,930
called judicial notice okay and judicial

787
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,420
notice occurs where courts rely on the

788
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:21,460
fat on a fact that hasn't been proven by

789
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,370
evidence okay so for example the sky is

790
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,010
blue we can they can make observation as

791
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,260
to human behaviors the laws of physics

792
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,480
the observable and broadly understood

793
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,990
laws of physics and the functioning of

794
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,060
the human organism these are items of

795
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,370
knowledge that are beyond reasonable

796
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:42,010
controversy that's the test beyond

797
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,620
reasonable controversy and across Canada

798
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,210
the case law suggests that courts can't

799
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,360
make take judicial notice of the

800
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,500
functioning of a machine this would now

801
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,030
this would be kind of a tall order

802
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,340
because that means that you'd have to

803
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,610
have an expert come in to testify as to

804
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,750
how Facebook functions which is just

805
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,240
patently ridiculous

806
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,590
it's very excessive so the courts have

807
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,360
although they developed an official

808
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,770
stance of saying no we can't take

809
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,110
judicial notice of the functioning of

810
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,840
machines they have discovered that that

811
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,340
presented significant issues and that

812
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,020
having an expert testified that that is

813
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,919
ridiculous and courts are coming around

814
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,480
to accepting for example that

815
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,040
geographical geographical location of

816
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,600
cell phone towers relating to the

817
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,300
location of cell phones themselves that

818
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,679
you can locate somebody based on where

819
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,590
their cell phone was in relation to a

820
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:34,060
cell phone tower and that the IP and and

821
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:36,220
also IP address evidence pointed to will

822
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,929
point to one location at a computer and

823
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,730
that you can correlate that with cell

824
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,760
phone data so judicial notice of this

825
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,950
now you can rebut judicial notice so for

826
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,230
example if you're a defense counsel you

827
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,000
can say well I know that IP address was

828
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,720
not associated with that computer at the

829
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,170
time or that the cell phone tower

830
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,530
evidence

831
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,690
was somehow doctored or incorrect all

832
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,000
right so it's always rebuttable but it

833
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,320
does pose significant issues when we're

834
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,510
talking about the difficulty of

835
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,159
rebutting that because judges do like to

836
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,670
make trial run as smoothly as possible

837
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,670
and they use judicial notice to do that

838
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:16,030
so beyond obvious facts and testimony

839
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,770
there is everything else okay so all of

840
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,270
the forms of evidence are subject to

841
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,610
something called the best Evidence Rule

842
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,830
and this rule requires that whatever

843
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,409
evidence is being used must be the best

844
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,990
form of evidence so this usually means

845
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,980
an original form okay or as close to the

846
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,260
original as possible

847
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,020
but I mean this isn't this is a Best in

848
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,540
Show this isn't absolute best or it's

849
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,730
not in this is doing your best okay so

850
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,070
it really is just the best possible

851
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,080
without saying without excluding

852
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:47,020
something some piece of evidence that

853
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,270
may be useful so for example IP records

854
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,070
from an ISP who is an independent third

855
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,560
party would be better evidence than

856
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,870
those collected by the victim because

857
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,429
those collected by the victim the victim

858
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,500
has an interest in the outcome of the

859
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,120
trial okay so for example if the

860
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,800
business is the victim of cyber attack

861
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,959
and they have they keep IP logs of

862
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,020
everything accessing their network they

863
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,820
have an interest in doctoring that

864
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,290
evidence so it's the independent third

865
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,060
party that would be the best evidence it

866
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,790
would have more weight both would be

867
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,529
admissible but one would have more

868
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:22,239
weight than the other under the best

869
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:25,450
Evidence Rule so improving electronic

870
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,659
documents okay and in in satisfying the

871
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:31,418
best Evidence Rule we use certain

872
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:35,230
methods to get evidence into trial okay

873
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:37,739
so to have either a witness testify to

874
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,389
the accuracy of the electronic document

875
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:43,959
that they that they either received or

876
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:46,239
sent it evidence of the document being

877
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,520
recorded or stored by the opposing party

878
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,759
or in the regular course of business of

879
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,800
the party so a third party for example

880
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,230
let's say that you have well my previous

881
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,380
example of the ISP okay

882
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,540
recording IP traffic and they are at an

883
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,220
interested third party and they may log

884
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,110
that information in the course of their

885
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,879
ordinary business they have no special

886
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,029
motivation for doing so so we

887
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,099
and trust it more okay improving the

888
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:13,720
integrity of the document system that

889
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,099
recorded or store the document by

890
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,078
evidence so you have to be sure that yes

891
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,299
this the system the computer system was

892
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,160
functioning properly when it saved this

893
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:24,250
evidence or when it reproduced this

894
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,569
electronic document or that the relevant

895
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,099
electronic document was signed by a

896
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:31,089
secured signature and we'll we'll get to

897
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:33,069
that in the next slide um or proving

898
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,170
that the document has been acted upon

899
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:37,058
this and this is a very old this is

900
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,450
actually a very old test it came from

901
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:42,789
where old contracts this wasn't the

902
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,009
original contract but both of you had

903
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:47,470
the same copy of the contract and you

904
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:49,660
both acted on clauses in the contract

905
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,720
therefore we can trust it it's good

906
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,210
evidence okay and the continuity and

907
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,618
condition of electronic documents must

908
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,140
be demonstrated before it's admissible

909
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,640
okay courts are very wary because they

910
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:04,240
know that documents can be easily edited

911
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,220
and because electronic documents are

912
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,689
technically artificial reproductions of

913
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,220
actual images sounds their authenticity

914
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,809
depends on the accurate representation

915
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,069
of what they purport to depict so it's

916
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:17,250
incredibly important that we're able to

917
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:19,690
prove that to prove their authenticity

918
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,759
now with physical evidence like DNA

919
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,160
collected from the suspect we refer to

920
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:25,930
this as the chain of custody okay with

921
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,180
physical evidence we track the chain of

922
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,558
custody with these little sheets they're

923
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,379
attached to each little piece of

924
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:34,869
evidence now with the electronic data we

925
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,390
we use the completely unalterable and

926
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:37,930
completely beyond reproach and beyond

927
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,538
question

928
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,368
metadata okay so you can you can imagine

929
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,170
the difficulties with that and courts

930
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:47,319
are still grappling with the fact that

931
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:50,529
metadata can be altered and perhaps

932
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:53,200
should not be used to prove that

933
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:55,890
electronic an electron it is is genuine

934
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,328
so in the case of electronic evidence

935
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,859
factual controversy about whether a

936
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:02,410
document is genuine or whether a

937
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:04,058
document has been altered a sort of for

938
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,009
example a doctored email is a question

939
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:08,170
of fact and what that is is that's a

940
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:11,259
question to be resolved during the case

941
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:13,359
by the judge or the jury it's not an

942
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:15,069
amiss ability issue so this is normally

943
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,348
a matter of weight not admissibility

944
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:20,100
like we talked about before this means

945
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:22,050
that even if one part one part

946
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,210
is arguing that a piece of electronic

947
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,280
evidence is altered it could be allowed

948
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,020
to enter into trial only to be

949
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,180
discredited by the other side if they

950
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:33,420
show evidence that it has been altered

951
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,310
so the the general rule is we would like

952
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,090
to see all the evidence that we possibly

953
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:41,549
can even if it may have been altered so

954
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,350
that it can be scrutinized by whoever is

955
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,540
deciding on a matter whether it's a

956
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,610
judge or a jury so returning to my

957
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,680
favorites one of my favorite examples a

958
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:52,080
copy of prosecution's in Canada rely on

959
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,169
scraping torrid networks for active ip's

960
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,569
searching material without sharing

961
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,160
material without authorization so these

962
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,960
are systems employed by the copyright

963
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,879
holders and ought to be subject to

964
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,890
pretty significant scrutiny as to how

965
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
they work and how accurate they keep

966
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,950
logs and whether or not these logs

967
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,040
should be relied on

968
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,859
so whenever whenever a copyright owner

969
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,410
comes in and says you know this person

970
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:18,180
had been had copied this movie it's

971
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,680
always well show me how your system

972
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,720
works show me that it was functioning

973
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,339
properly and there are multiple ways of

974
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,259
discrediting these systems and the time

975
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,760
stamps that they use on these systems so

976
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,760
there's a lot of ways that we can look

977
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:35,010
at at these items and say no it's not

978
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,780
quite as sound as you think so if you

979
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,850
were listening to my incredibly boring

980
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,550
lesson on the laws of evidence you

981
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,740
probably tuned into the fact that it all

982
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,140
ends up with the judge okay the judge

983
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,209
decides whether or not to accept

984
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,980
extradition okay I know that's a

985
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,470
separate issue from evidence but we're

986
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,440
summing it all up here the judge decides

987
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,180
whether or not to accept a plea deal the

988
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,370
judge decides whether or not an expert

989
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,259
will be allowed to offer their opinion

990
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:03,509
at trial and the judge decides whether

991
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,400
or not they will take judicial notice of

992
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,920
the workings of a computer system or

993
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,650
other issues the judge also decides

994
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,510
whether or not evidence is in okay even

995
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,850
in a jury trial it's the judge who

996
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:17,370
decides what evidence the jury will see

997
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,170
and what they won't see and that is

998
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,150
that's actually decided in a separate

999
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,600
hearing where the jury is not permitted

1000
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,670
to see what's happening so in our legal

1001
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,370
system the judge has a great deal of

1002
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,860
discretionary power which makes their

1003
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:34,200
role incredibly important and makes

1004
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,770
their understanding of Technology equal

1005
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,660
important so the other issue with

1006
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:43,020
hacking prosecutions and I've alluded to

1007
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:47,098
this is that judges and lawyers are well

1008
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:51,810
I mean old okay in the case of the

1009
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,589
notorious RBG wonderful but old and as a

1010
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,020
side note

1011
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:57,779
did you know Canada has an RBG

1012
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,520
equivalent this is Beverly McLaughlin

1013
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,829
she is the former Chief Justice of the

1014
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,270
Supreme Court of Canada I saw her in an

1015
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,310
airport once and I almost fainted she's

1016
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,009
absolutely my idol anyway I digress so

1017
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:11,190
let's say I want to become a judge like

1018
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:14,010
my idol that Mac so I would graduate

1019
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,380
high school I can hear you chuckling I

1020
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,190
sense it I can't hear it but I can sense

1021
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,140
it

1022
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:24,210
so I complete my undergrad year for and

1023
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,190
assuming I had any direction whatsoever

1024
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,349
at the age of 21 I would spend a few

1025
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,000
months studying the LSAT I'd write the

1026
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:31,920
LSAT and assuming I got good a good

1027
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,329
enough mark to get into law school the

1028
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,940
first time around I would attend law

1029
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:37,230
school from year five to seven I would

1030
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,349
then article for a year

1031
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,480
write the bar exam and that takes me to

1032
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:45,089
year eight okay now I'm a lawyer at the

1033
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,280
age of 25 I was not a lawyer at the age

1034
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:50,430
of 25 I did not have that direction

1035
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,579
I did other things so the youngest judge

1036
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,529
in Canada is Rosalia Bela who currently

1037
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:57,300
sits on the Supreme Court of Canada she

1038
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,569
was appointed at the age of 29 which

1039
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,640
makes me feel kind of like a slub but

1040
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:05,880
most judges are appointed between 45 and

1041
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,980
52 having worked for about 15 to 20

1042
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,930
years as a lawyer doing lawyer stuff

1043
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,569
okay which doesn't necessarily include

1044
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,419
keeping current on the most recent

1045
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:18,329
technology okay and most judges sit

1046
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,609
until there's 75 or older okay there's

1047
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:23,700
the mandatory retirement age for for

1048
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:26,700
judges is much in dispute and they're

1049
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,640
certainly very skilled Juris but whether

1050
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:32,970
or not they keep up on technology is a

1051
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,470
separate issue and ultimately it's it's

1052
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,990
up to the lawyers to explain new

1053
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,730
technologies to the court okay most of

1054
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,069
what lawyers do in terms of offering

1055
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,670
expert evidence is for the aid of the

1056
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:43,349
court okay

1057
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,299
our goal is to assist the judge in

1058
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:48,400
understanding the issues in

1059
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:50,219
understanding what what holes were

1060
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,839
poking in the prosecution has evidence

1061
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:57,189
but the issue remains is that there's a

1062
00:41:52,839 --> 00:42:00,160
very large gap in understanding that may

1063
00:41:57,189 --> 00:42:02,049
not have been filled by the be filled in

1064
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,729
by the prosecution or defense okay so

1065
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:05,079
judges maybe through no fault of their

1066
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,178
own they're incredibly intelligent

1067
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:10,630
people but through no fault of their own

1068
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:13,329
they may lack the perspective required

1069
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,719
to understand the implications of the

1070
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:18,819
technology the functioning they simply

1071
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,910
don't have everything it takes to

1072
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,630
understand all the nuances so I guess

1073
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,348
what I'm saying

1074
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:30,069
except the courtroom is not an ideal

1075
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:32,229
place for settling all disputes so

1076
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:33,880
something else you would have noticed is

1077
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:36,038
that the may the majority of these

1078
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,959
prosecutions were for hackers hacks

1079
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:41,289
perpetrated against the government the

1080
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:44,229
other two were large organizations with

1081
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:46,539
natural national interest and capital P

1082
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:48,848
power okay so you're messing with some

1083
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:51,009
pretty big players here which brings me

1084
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:56,130
to the final observation of how hackers

1085
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:59,559
go to jail the ones who who go to jail

1086
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,019
attack large entities they be they

1087
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,179
states or organizations mixing hacking

1088
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:06,999
in politics is for another talk but make

1089
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:09,910
no mistakes humbling a powerful

1090
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:12,660
institution results in that power being

1091
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:15,308
motivated to invest in coming after you

1092
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,979
remember even in Nova Scotia we have a

1093
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:20,859
special prosecutor for cyber crimes Nova

1094
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:23,259
Scotia we have that all right and if we

1095
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:25,839
have those resources think about the

1096
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:28,569
u.s. federal government so there's some

1097
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,660
long-standing hacking culture advice on

1098
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:33,699
this topic okay stay away from

1099
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,098
government computers you will find out

1100
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:37,630
very fast that attempting to hack mil

1101
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,900
tech installation is next to impossible

1102
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:43,150
and will get you arrested before you can

1103
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,160
say oh big brother has infinite

1104
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,660
resources to draw on and has all the

1105
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,808
time it needs to hunt you down

1106
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,449
they will spend literally years tracking

1107
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:54,759
you down as tempting as it may be don't

1108
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:57,099
rush into it you'll regret it in the end

1109
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:59,319
okay and I think that's that is

1110
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,160
incredibly wise advice and it's from

1111
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:02,770
1993

1112
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,710
and it continues to ring true to this

1113
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:07,710
day all right thank you very much

1114
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:27,520
there we go helps if I unmute my mic so

1115
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,850
we do have a few questions starting to

1116
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:35,770
come in here the first one let me just

1117
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:39,220
see here is cyber evidence use to clear

1118
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:41,340
people uh in crimes for example I didn't

1119
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,100
kill the guy I was at home watching

1120
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:48,310
videos online for five hours

1121
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,690
uh yes absolutely it has been I can't I

1122
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,020
can't actually think of casings right

1123
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:55,420
now but there have been situations where

1124
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,190
for example people try not to

1125
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,620
incriminate themselves but there have

1126
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:01,180
been times where it's like no I was you

1127
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,690
know I was actually downloading porn

1128
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,279
here's the logs that it's the only

1129
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,260
example like that can come to mind I'm

1130
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,480
sorry I know it's like before noon and

1131
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,370
I'm talking about pornography look it's

1132
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,910
just the way it is but yes it has been

1133
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,920
okay so and in terms of the cell phone

1134
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,129
triangulation people have argued that it

1135
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,050
can be inaccurate enough to establish

1136
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:26,130
location in relation to a computer so if

1137
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:28,270
they in prosecutions for cybercrime

1138
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,980
where they've said like look we know you

1139
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:32,560
were in the house because cellphone data

1140
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,910
put you in the house we had your we know

1141
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,580
your computer was active at that time

1142
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:39,129
you were downloading things they can say

1143
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,990
well look I you might have put me within

1144
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,730
50 feet of my house but I was in the

1145
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,729
yard I don't know who is at my computer

1146
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,240
another

1147
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:54,419
coming in here is is kanda or sorry in

1148
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,720
Kanda is there any disparity in

1149
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:02,310
likelihood of extradition based on the

1150
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:05,790
party that's in power so essentially

1151
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:06,960
asking if it's the u.s. is it more

1152
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,840
likely they're going to be extradited

1153
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,520
there is that the question

1154
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,410
it's said based on pardon power so I

1155
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:19,110
guess maybe we can answer both ways

1156
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:20,310
based on yeah so extradition and I think

1157
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,970
I mean I alluded to it right the

1158
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:26,640
extradition is a mixed political legal

1159
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,680
issue okay that's why the final stopgap

1160
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,509
is the minister so the minister decides

1161
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,509
whether or not it goes through in terms

1162
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:35,940
of reaching the through the phases a

1163
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,660
judge can stop it before it even gets to

1164
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,570
the minister

1165
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,250
so the your legal rights are considered

1166
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,360
before it gets to the minister level so

1167
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,340
if your charter rights are going to be

1168
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,230
violated by extradite into the you to

1169
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,120
the US the judge will decide that and it

1170
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,400
won't even get to the minister so the

1171
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,990
minister only decides if the judge says

1172
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,700
yes it's a go

1173
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,240
the minister decides yes or no and

1174
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:58,649
they'll act and deny those on

1175
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,089
compassionate grounds that's another one

1176
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:03,390
of the grounds it's a it's one of the

1177
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:06,110
optional grounds so for example if

1178
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:09,089
somebody had a young family in Canada

1179
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,350
they may extradition may be denied so

1180
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,960
that they could remain

1181
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:14,580
although incarcerated in Canada close to

1182
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,800
their families there are lots of reasons

1183
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,660
that extradition is denied but

1184
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,000
ultimately it only becomes a political

1185
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:24,509
question after the legal part of it is

1186
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,210
sorted out perfect and then we do have

1187
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:30,210
one more question here wondering if you

1188
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,560
can expand upon the rights reduced areas

1189
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,300
at border crossings

1190
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,250
at some of some of the unusual

1191
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,190
protections of citizens and the

1192
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:43,470
standards for search and/or searches do

1193
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:47,160
not apply in particular then they posted

1194
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:48,600
a CBC article Oh time to read that

1195
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,509
people know we're having to go to the

1196
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,160
article ah but it was used to search a

1197
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:56,430
computer that would not normally match

1198
00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:00,430
standards but could you protest though

1199
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:02,049
being crucified by the media Oh

1200
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:05,049
God so that's that's a very complicated

1201
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,910
question okay so let's let's break that

1202
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,580
down so the first part of it is and

1203
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,960
correct me if I'm wrong Brad but so the

1204
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,450
first part of that is there's these

1205
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,030
these awkward zones and in travel

1206
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,799
locations airports namely where you have

1207
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,840
these reduced rights so you're basically

1208
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,100
you're exiting the zone where you have

1209
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,110
all your rights as a Canadian citizen

1210
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,200
then you have these altered rights as a

1211
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:29,140
traveler to the US and then you cross

1212
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,890
over the board of the US and you have

1213
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:34,210
the rights of a visitor in the u.s. so

1214
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:36,670
that gray zone in between there's I

1215
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:39,130
think what what this person is asking

1216
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,780
about and in that zone you have a

1217
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,860
reduced expectation of privacy and

1218
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,650
that's it's not that you don't have

1219
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:47,440
rights it's that the expectation of

1220
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,480
privacy is significantly reduced and it

1221
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,090
continues to be reduced by cultural

1222
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,460
norms and I'm very interested to see how

1223
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,110
Koba 19 impacts this because well we

1224
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,480
have health testing in that area now as

1225
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:01,390
well which is interesting that's for

1226
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,770
another time but in searching computers

1227
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,920
because you have that reduced

1228
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:08,410
expectation of privacy as long as the

1229
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,140
computer is is unlocked and they can

1230
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,819
access it it can it can be viewed okay

1231
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,259
and they generally only do a cursory

1232
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,580
search I know I talked about this and

1233
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,320
not much has changed since the last time

1234
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,910
I talked about it except that the

1235
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,580
expectation of privacy has kind of been

1236
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:24,190
whittling away a little bit over the

1237
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:26,319
course of time but generally they can do

1238
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,700
a cursory look at a computer what's the

1239
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:35,080
other part of the question there was a

1240
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:38,049
second part second part basically can

1241
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,299
you protest it without being crucified

1242
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:44,050
by the media is like do you have a

1243
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,610
choice at all I guess well without being

1244
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,260
persecuted by the media I mean the media

1245
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,520
decides what the media is gonna do if

1246
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,250
it's a slow news day they're coming

1247
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,050
after you but I mean to be honest with

1248
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,640
you the border stories have been have

1249
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,800
actually been a subject of very positive

1250
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,480
reporting of people who resist as long

1251
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,370
as you are polite

1252
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,080
it's very Canadian for you to be polite

1253
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,720
at the border even if you're extremely

1254
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,600
angry and as long as you do that and

1255
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,600
protest respectfully and don't make

1256
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,430
scene then generally the media is

1257
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,100
recorded them very positively and it's

1258
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,569
and it

1259
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,339
because the thing is is that not many

1260
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:19,550
people the average person does not

1261
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:21,410
travel very often okay people people who

1262
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,730
work in fields like I work in and it

1263
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,500
feels like most of the people here work

1264
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,320
in we travelled more than your average

1265
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,780
person so getting on a plane once a year

1266
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,370
is I mean I think that that's actually

1267
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,920
more than the average person travels so

1268
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:35,299
when the average person thinks about or

1269
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,250
thinks about their expectations at the

1270
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,760
airport and then they read these

1271
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,230
articles on people being searched

1272
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,050
they're you know they're flabbergasted

1273
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:47,120
by the violation of their rights even

1274
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,920
though their rights usually aren't being

1275
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,109
violated it's just to reduce like I said

1276
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,760
that reduced expectation of privacy so

1277
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,920
the media actually has done very

1278
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,840
positive reporting as a general rule on

1279
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,400
people who have resisted having their

1280
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,130
their items searched there was a report

1281
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,820
of a lawyer very recently who went over

1282
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,020
went over the border I'm actually where

1283
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,610
we're actually dealing with this I'm a

1284
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,320
member of a technology subgroup with the

1285
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,060
Nova Scotian barrister Society coming up

1286
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,280
with policies for lawyers dealing with

1287
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,960
technology and one of the things that we

1288
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,700
will likely be grappling with in the

1289
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,340
next little bit is how do lawyers go

1290
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,259
across the border this lawyer went

1291
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,780
across the border they had all their

1292
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,950
items and of course we have privileged

1293
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,450
privileged client communication if you

1294
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,930
have client communication on your device

1295
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:31,730
what are the limits on that search but

1296
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,440
that but my point is is that that person

1297
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:36,830
was very positively reported on because

1298
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,350
they they family they refused the search

1299
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:41,299
they canceled their trip they backed out

1300
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:45,350
of the sky back out of the screening

1301
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,490
area and and left essentially they

1302
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,750
extracted themselves from the situation

1303
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:50,589
because they couldn't ensure the

1304
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,490
confidentiality of their clients data

1305
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:55,010
excellent and we got one last question

1306
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:57,229
that just came in here in some countries

1307
00:51:55,010 --> 00:52:01,820
violating copyright for digital content

1308
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:04,640
is not very well defined what will

1309
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,680
happen to people with no knowledge of

1310
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,799
the crime when they moved to either at

1311
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,560
the US or a country like Canada that can

1312
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,690
extradite them to the US so is that

1313
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,190
something could speak on at all or I can

1314
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:21,920
so my my law professor who taught me

1315
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:25,520
criminal law she she started her first

1316
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,520
day with us way back when when I was a

1317
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,820
directionless

1318
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,810
twenty-five-year-old saying that

1319
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,680
ignorance of the law is not an excuse so

1320
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:37,380
she went through a list of very

1321
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,600
ridiculous criminal laws around around

1322
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,060
the world well I get for like eating a

1323
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,529
grapefruit you know with that with a

1324
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,759
spoon in Florida or something absurd

1325
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:49,020
like that I don't think that's actually

1326
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,760
it's not actually example but some some

1327
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:52,230
ridiculous laws and you will be subject

1328
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,660
to those laws if you go to those

1329
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:57,270
jurisdictions regardless of whether or

1330
00:52:54,660 --> 00:53:00,810
not you were aware that they were crimes

1331
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:02,190
so I know that the last talk that I did

1332
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:06,029
I talked a lot about the intent element

1333
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:07,800
of an offense when we talk about intent

1334
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:10,320
we're talking about the intent to commit

1335
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,060
the action we're not talking about the

1336
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:15,510
intent to break the law

1337
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:18,299
so whether or not that action is illegal

1338
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,840
you should you are expected to know that

1339
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,640
just by being inside my jurisdiction

1340
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,740
perfect thank you so that's all the

1341
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,270
