background and her obsession as she put

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,560
it insecurity stems and starts from

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,649
running her own company and running a OS

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,800

which hae is a partner of us and in

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,390
again in her words has been a

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,809
professional computer geek for over 20

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,309
years

19
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,160
hi everyone I am Tanya Tinka thank you

20
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,910
so much for coming to my talk today at

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,280
besides Halifax I'm really really

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,770
excited that we're having these high

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,860
telefax because when an access icon was

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,509
canceled it I was really sad I'm really

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,840
really happy that we're still able to do

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,259
something as a community so I'm going to

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,090
talk to you today about so the title of

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,830
the talk is purple is the new black

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,630
we're going to talk about purple teaming

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,330
we're also going to talk about how to

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,740
modernize application security and what

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,990
more modern ways are oppressed

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,539
approaches problem because all of the

34
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,548
tech is changing dev ops everyone is

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:41,670
changing and that means we have to

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,780
change too okay so first of all let's go

37
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,340
over just some of the things we're going

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,229
to talk about today so you can make sure

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,820
that you are in the correct talk so

40
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,670
we're going to talk about red team and

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,439
by red team I mean offensive security

42
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,210
I'm gonna go into this in a bit more

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,839
depth we're going to talk about blue

44
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,880
team which is defensive security we're

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,619
going to talk about purple team which I

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,049
consider collaborative security we're

47
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,819
also going to talk about how lots of

48
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,849
people see hackers like this

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,790
they see security people dangerous and

50
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,280
criminals and badass like they see lots

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,890
and lots of I just see lots of negative

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,950
connotations but we are also going to

53
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:29,369
talk about how I see them protecting

54
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,738
others helping people a noble profession

55
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,609
this is what I see when I think of our

56
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,799
industry including hackers not malicious

57
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:39,900
actors for people who tinker with things

58
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,250
and play with things and takes them a

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,810
pair and put them back together again so

60
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,090
we can figure out what all the security

61
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,220
problems are and so you're gonna see a

62
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,010
lot of this positive bias essentially

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,400
throughout this talk so with that let's

64
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,138
do the mandatory about me slides so

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,180
speakers through the side so that you

66
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,980
will feel that we are qualified to give

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,430
our own talk so let me tell you a little

68
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,090
bit about me I am Tony I'm Gingka I like

69
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:10,590
punk rock I'm also known as she hacks

70
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,780
purple and I am a proud purple team I'm

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,659
totally obsessed with ojas the open web

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,299
application security project I'm one of

73
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,179
the many people who founded woolsack

74
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,819
women of security I'm a huge fan of bad

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,440
you have a chapter in Halifax I believe

76
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,970
they're meeting virtually like the rest

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,599
of the chapters you can still come and

78
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,510
hang out um and I'm a trainer and coach

79
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,918
at XI X purple dot dev so hopefully

80
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,078
you're like she's alright

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,159
also I'm originally from Ottawa but I

82
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,190
live in Victoria now mm-hmm okay

83
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,198
so this is the outline for the talk um

84
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,150
if you have questions you can put them

85
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,919
in the chat and at the end I'll just go

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,440
through all of them and answer them I'm

87
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,540
going to cover a lot of material I feel

88
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,949
like I should apologize in advance for

89
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,198
melting your brains because all day you

90
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:04,019
just saw awesome content starting with

91
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,359
Anna manly I saw her speak at it when

92
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,030
take 2nd last year she's incredible like

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,639
all the talks all day really awesome and

94
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,939
so now you're gonna end with like way

95
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,099
more way more information so get ready

96
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,048
okay so approaches from modern

97
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,680
application Security's so four parts to

98
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,090
this talk the first one is collaboration

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,830
empathy and advocacy

100
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,349
and so you might be thinking Oh Torah is

101
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,210
getting soft on us and I am a little bit

102
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,910
but there's good reason there's like

103
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,888
business reasons and you'll see we're

104
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,000
gonna talk about all the types of like

105
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,530
modern apps and then how we secure those

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,780
because we have to take so some things

107
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,638
are the same as always and then some

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,320
things have really really changed and I

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,690
want to talk about all the new things so

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,389
I'm not going to talk about like all the

111
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,290
standard old stuff I'm gonna talk about

112
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,669
a new modern cool new stuff I'm going to

113
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,860
talk about automating boring things

114
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:00,810
because that is why we work in IT we

115
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,300
don't like doing something twice and

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,000
then I'm going to talk about how you can

117
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,220
continue to learn because besides in

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Atlantic ii only happened once a year

119
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,600
and you need to learn oh you're if you

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,120
want to keep pace with all the things

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,220
that your dev and ops and the rest of IT

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,450
people are doing that you're trying to

123
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:26,220
run after them scaring okay let's get

124
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:28,080
purple okay so I'm gonna start with a

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,210
couple quick definitions because I want

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,330
to make sure that we are all on the same

127
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:36,090
page so this besides is covering many

128
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,380
many topics not just software security

129
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,719
so some of you are like oh I already

130
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,340
know that Tanya but it's okay because

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,780
there's a lot of people that don't know

132
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,020
these things and I want to make sure we

133
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,700
are all on board together before we

134
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,760
continue on to the brand new stuff so

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,919
definitions first what is application

136
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,260
security and why does shkolu app sect

137
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,229
it's because it is a mouthful that's why

138
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,889
I hate I'm so application security is

139
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:04,860
any and every activity that you do to

140
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,919
ensure your software is secure so that

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,690
could mean Oh

142
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,729
that can mean hiring a penetration

143
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,800
tester or someone to come and do a

144
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,740
security assessment of your applications

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,139
it could be performing a secure code

146
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,580
review exercise and reviewing all of

147
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,720
your different security functions to

148
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,659
make sure they're secure

149
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,639
it could be hearing on a podcast that

150
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,430
this certain version of this free mark

151
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,740
is insecure and then upgrading it so

152
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,570
that you don't accidentally like end up

153
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,830
being attacked and being vulnerable to

154
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:39,230
that vulnerability anything that you do

155
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,700
even like if you find out that this

156
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,740
function that you used to use that

157
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,150
totally used to be fine but is not fine

158
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,340
now

159
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,380
is insecure and so then you just rep

160
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,599
through all your source code like doing

161
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,190
the search and then you find it and you

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,440
replace it with the more modern and

163
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,650
secure option for that function

164
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,160
anything you do it counts it all counts

165
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,590
to you fighting the good fight with us

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,710
so people are always asking me well what

167
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,140
is steps tech ops and it is application

168
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,580
security adjusted for a DevOps

169
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,750
environment and my friend

170
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,150
Imran said that and basically it's about

171
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,860
us as application security professionals

172
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,080
adjusting ourselves and our activities

173
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,990
so we have the same goals that we've

174
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,609
always had but maybe we need to figure

175
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,960
out how to use a pay Klein or figure out

176
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,060
how do like how do we work with

177
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,919
infrastructures code so it's us

178
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,410
adjusting ourselves so that we can still

179
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,660
secure the modern stuff using the

180
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,780
methodology that the software people and

181
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:44,450
operations people are using okay

182
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:47,270
so that's a lot what is red team so it

183
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,690
is offensive or attacker style security

184
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,820
its adversarial the idea is it's

185
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,530
security testing that is against

186
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,310
production system so that you know what

187
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:02,960
real risk is you'll find actual values

188
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:06,470
it's not a paper exercise so penetration

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,299
testing writing exploits or attacking

190
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,880
production systems with permission

191
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,750
Allah is considered part of reg team so

192
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:18,560
it's offensive style security Blue team

193
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:21,130
is defensive security so they are our

194
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,510
protectors they're the people who

195
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,100
implement our defenses like they're the

196
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,140
people that put the firewall up in the

197
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,570
first place and make sure that it's

198
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,030
effective and it's working properly they

199
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,330
are monitoring logging patching bug

200
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:39,400
fixing creating you know adding shields

201
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,470
so that they can defend us against abuse

202
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,840
so what is purple team they're going to

203
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,730
be a few slides on this because there is

204
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,770
not a hundred percent agreement yet in

205
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:54,350
our industry so I call it collaborate

206
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:59,569
empathy and advocacy but there's

207
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:02,750
technical stuff too so it is a bit of

208
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,430
doing red and blue I do agree because I

209
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,380
still have to do security testing but I

210
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,489
still also have to help the developers

211
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,040
defend our code as a knapsack

212
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,840
professional I still do I have to

213
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,050
collaborate between the two teams lots

214
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,680
of teams I have to cooperate all the

215
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,630
time

216
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,800
active you'll love the communicating

217
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,570
because sometimes the rest of the

218
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,579
security team isn't listening to the

219
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,490
developers and as that aspect person I'm

220
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,330
read a little I'm teaching and providing

221
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,790
tools

222
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:35,300
I am enabling the developers to do their

223
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,530
jobs securely and I'm a helper basically

224
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,599
they're like I don't know how to do this

225
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:42,589
migrate I'll come home make sure you do

226
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,510
it securely um often known as the bridge

227
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,460
between security and the developers I

228
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,400
believe that purple team is application

229
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,190
security as a whole well red and blue

230
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,180
team both overlap as part of app SEC um

231
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,490
so when I talk about purple team I mean

232
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,949
the duties of a fully functional

233
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,770
application security team so they do

234
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,420
blue and they do red you're not going to

235
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,460
have a good app SEC team if all they do

236
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,860
is contest and you're not going to have

237
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,750
a good app SEC team if all they do is

238
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,670
secure coding exercises and they never

239
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,200
actually test anything you have to do

240
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,819
boats so what do purple teams do what is

241
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,670
their work they have hold consultations

242
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,460
with developers they provide guidance

243
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,699
assistance enablement sometimes they

244
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:35,990
write policies they'll give developers

245
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,700
tools or even make tools they will write

246
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,710
documentation that actually makes sense

247
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,610
that's written in software developer

248
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:45,170
words instead of security words you can

249
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,430
use security where it's to talk to the

250
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,650
security team but you need to use

251
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,410
software developer words to talk to the

252
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,390
programmers so you can't say session IDs

253
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,069
must be ephemeral because that is vague

254
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,780
and they don't know it's a design after

255
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,510
but a security person is like oh yeah

256
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,209
short lived got it great so you have to

257
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,480
communicate clearly and the other thing

258
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,940
that they do is they

259
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,040
the Kate for security and developers

260
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,810
we're gonna talk about what advocating

261
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,630
means in a bit but essentially purple

262
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,300
team must advocate for both sides so

263
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,889
they need to support what the security

264
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,019
team wants what their priorities and

265
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,209
goals are and they need to also support

266
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,790
what the developers need to get done and

267
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,888
what their policies and goals are and so

268
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,410
you'll have to support both at the same

269
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,190
time which means you have to be really

270
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,899
good at listening

271
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:39,630
um so purple team is a modern approach

272
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,370
to application security we used to have

273
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,019
the security team over here and used to

274
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,500
have the developers a way over here and

275
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,500
mostly they just talked like that and

276
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,389
now we have an area of the security team

277
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,310
just dedicated to helping developers

278
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,740
make more secure software and this is a

279
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,089
more modern approach we did not always

280
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:03,870
do it this way okay so I said I was

281
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:07,250
gonna explain what advocacy means and so

282
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,660
advocacy is showing public support for

283
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:14,730
recommendation of a particular cause or

284
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:19,500
policy and that's Wikipedia speaking but

285
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:21,569
basically it means that you are like

286
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,519
working towards and making sure that

287
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:26,099
this goal happens and so when you're

288
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,720
doing advocacy for security within the

289
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,790
developers you know you might be giving

290
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,560
a lunch and learn about the new secure

291
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,139
coding guideline and teaching them

292
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,989
everything they need to know and if you

293
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,790
are advocating for the developers with

294
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,980
the security team you may say to them

295
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,050
like listen this new policy is coming

296
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,790
out but you know these three teams need

297
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,949
to be grandfathered in for the first two

298
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,149
months and then we can do this and this

299
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,910
and this because these things are

300
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:52,920
happening so like yes we can comply with

301
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:58,889
your standard but first we have like we

302
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:01,410
need some accommodations if you want to

303
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:04,380
be able to advocate for security there's

304
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,389
some principles for success that I want

305
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,920
to go over so like ways that you can

306
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,160
make sure you're getting your message

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,540
across so that they're picking down what

308
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
are they're picking up what you're

309
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,660
putting down we want to make sure you

310
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
actually get what you

311
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,819
in the end which is more secure software

312
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,269
so let's look at the principles that you

313
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:29,139
can use to make sure that you advocate

314
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:31,600
successfully for security whenever

315
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:35,410
possible you want to allow independence

316
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,990
and by that I mean self-service so if

317
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,759
you this is the best ever if you're a

318
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,300
software developer I don't know about

319
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,370
you but I do not want to have to wait on

320
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,878
anyone I always want to be able to do it

321
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,829
myself

322
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,500
so for instance if you want them to

323
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,449
always use updated like you want them to

324
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,759
run scans on their images before they

325
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:55,899
release them great give them a tool show

326
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,750
them how to use it let them use it

327
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,519
themselves or if they want to be able to

328
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,129
run you know it could vast scan a

329
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,860
dynamic application security like web

330
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,850
app scan in their dev environment set it

331
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,040
up so that they can do it themselves

332
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,949
like train them and then just give them

333
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,769
a safe place and let them go do it

334
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,180
micromanaging does not work well it's

335
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,250
important that we have confidentiality

336
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,459
with them they need to know that if they

337
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,959
tell us they've made a mistake

338
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,459
that they can trust us now that does not

339
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,339
mean if they break the law we're not

340
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,349
gonna tell obviously not but for

341
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,660
instance if someone's like I did this

342
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,180
and it said I'm proud and I need to fix

343
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,620
it I need your help they need to know

344
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,969
that you're not going to you know run

345
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,550
until the rest of their team and make

346
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:43,689
fun of them and shame them that's really

347
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,699
really really important we want to make

348
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:49,180
sure we're doing a human centric

349
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:52,149
approach I've worked at up so I used to

350
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,540
be a pen tester for web apps and so many

351
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:58,569
times so many times I get called in the

352
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,269
very last minute and I you know I'm like

353
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:04,089
pew pew pew pew I find so much stuff on

354
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,220
and then I'm giving them a report like

355
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,689
two days before they go like and then

356
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,790
the software developers are totally

357
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,059
sweating it out left escape only it

358
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,399
can't fix all the things super stressful

359
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,920
like what if we did it earlier what if

360
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,540
we did some of the tests earlier what if

361
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,120
we didn't put them through hell every

362
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,129
single time so that would be a human

363
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,259
centric approach like remembering that

364
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:27,850
people need to rest it sounds like

365
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,350
really obvious but you would be

366
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,160
surprised how many people don't consider

367
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,629
that

368
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I worked somewhere once and this woman

369
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,050
made a plan for everyone to work over

370
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,639
Christmas Day and a New Year's Day

371
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,219
because that was more convenient for her

372
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:44,740
and I take okay so that's not happening

373
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:47,310
let's make a real plan empowerment and

374
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,810
so software developers are really smart

375
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,099
otherwise they would be X software

376
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,250
developers because they would have been

377
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,529
fired um so if you give them tools if

378
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,360
you create processes that work you give

379
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,490
them the knowledge to do their job

380
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,699
he will go create secure suffer for you

381
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,560
so if you can empower them it is so much

382
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,410
more likely that you will end up with

383
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,209
more secure software at the end I

384
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,910
believe it's important that everyone has

385
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:15,489
access to the security team I have

386
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,319
worked before at places where they only

387
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,199
wanted to teach the senior developers

388
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:22,300
about security because according to

389
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:24,069
those senior developers the junior and

390
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,099
intermediate developers are to don't

391
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:30,069
want to learn my gosh I don't work for

392
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,040
you I think that you need to teach

393
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:36,040
everyone or at least make it available

394
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,099
as an option to them maybe not everyone

395
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,449
is capable of learning or ready but

396
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,130
giving them the opportunity so if

397
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,959
there's a junior developer that's really

398
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:47,170
really really excited about security

399
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:50,380
like maybe give them borrow them blend

400
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:55,269
them a book or take them to a meeting

401
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,899
etc I believe in accountability if you

402
00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:01,060
have a service level agreement and SLA

403
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:03,399
with the developers let's say you know

404
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,698
critical bugs must be fixed within 48

405
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,839
hours of being reported I think maybe

406
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,819
you should have a service level

407
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,549
agreement like we will get back to

408
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:15,129
emails within three business days

409
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:17,589
because like they can't just wait on you

410
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,589
all the time if you're like expecting

411
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:22,208
them to not make you wait it's really

412
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,188
important that you hold yourself

413
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,890
accountable too because that will create

414
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,679
better results with them especially if

415
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,169
you admit fault on the last one is

416
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,679
making security accessible for everyone

417
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,809
and so there are lots of people that you

418
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,490
work with that might be dyslexic or have

419
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:45,010
ADHD or be neuro atypical etc if you're

420
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,350
going to give a whole lot of cream

421
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,990
maybe someone would be better being able

422
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,169
to do it from home or maybe someone

423
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,480
would work better with an audio book etc

424
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,370
if you put it out there that you know

425
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,890
you'll try to accommodate people if they

426
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,559
have special needs you will not believe

427
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,170
how much that matters to people who need

428
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,490
a little something slightly different so

429
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,710
that they can learn or so that they are

430
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,010
able to accomplish their job at like 100

431
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:14,770
percent skill level so if you can make

432
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,379
security more accessible in any way so

433
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,240
for instance like we're in Canada so

434
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,490
offering some of your stuff in French

435
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,809
even if most your office is English but

436
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,520
if you know you have some francophones

437
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,110
ask them like do you need this in French

438
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,309
because I could get it for you that

439
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:34,240
would make a big difference okay

440
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:36,970
empathy 8min so the soft skills are life

441
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,580
skills but not everyone seems to have

442
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:44,800
them and you are going to be an awful

443
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,320
application security engineer if you

444
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,300
can't understand where the other side is

445
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,250
coming from empathy is about

446
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,678
understanding where other people come

447
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,120
from and if you sit there and look at

448
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,190
the developers and you're like listen

449
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,199
and made the secure coding standard and

450
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,960
it's going into effect next week and you

451
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,929
all just have to comply that has no

452
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,610
empathy and that means no one's gonna be

453
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,280
a compliant you haven't given them any

454
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,870
time you didn't teach it to them when

455
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
you do things like that like you just

456
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,590
facepalm down like you're not gonna

457
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,610
succeed you're not going to do a good

458
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,980
job and I mean not having people like

459
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,979
you at work it's probably not important

460
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,540
to every person however if people can

461
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,160
get along with you and they get that

462
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,020
you're trying they will go the extra

463
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,590
mile for you and you are trying to

464
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,110
convince at least 100 developers for

465
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,959
each security person to do a thing that

466
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,290
you want like they're already winning

467
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,240
there's way more of them than you if you

468
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,490
are giving them no sympathy and no

469
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,170
empathy and not seeing anything from

470
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,929
their side like you're just gonna feel

471
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,400
really miserably and so if you have no

472
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:55,310
empathy you probably want a different

473
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,750
job because you will find this job

474
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:01,169
okay so I want to talk about idols and

475
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,480
our ridiculous obsession with hackers so

476
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,730
some people tell me that we're not

477
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,670
obsessed with hackers and that's in my

478
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,100
imagination and it's just on my mind

479
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:14,250
because it's the place that I work or my

480
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,340
job but that's not what I see I actually

481
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:22,410
see like it appears that lots of people

482
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:26,340
are really really really idolizing red

483
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:29,730
team and hackers and I if you're

484
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,230
thinking this isn't true I ask you why

485
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,920
are there not this many movies about

486
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,930
accountants right where they're not this

487
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,680
many movies about all the other jobs in

488
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:43,020
tech there's so few people that actually

489
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,610
do penetration testing there's actually

490
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,900
very case however criminals like

491
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,570
compared to how many software developers

492
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,850
or project managers that we have but we

493
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,760
are totally obsessed and in my opinion

494
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:55,590
is really damaging our industry I feel

495
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,480
like a lot of people they see all these

496
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:02,340
stereotypes or like people in the black

497
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,500
hoodie extreme arrogance breaking a law

498
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,290
and people think oh I don't belong there

499
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,270
I remember when I was asked to first

500
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:12,420
train security I was like oh I don't

501
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,090
think I'd fit in I just was like I'm a

502
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:20,280
nerdy little dweeb that codes in my

503
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:21,780
cubicle and the person who became my

504
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,250
first mentor just like telling me how

505
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,220
he'd be really good and you know I

506
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,020
clearly it worked out but I feel like

507
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,420
we're repelling so many awesome people

508
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,580
away with the stereotype I'm also seeing

509
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,170
security models we can't afford because

510
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,139
people think that pen testing is the

511
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,370
only thing that's important and so then

512
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,110
they're spending all their money on that

513
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,389
when they're not doing any of the bare

514
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,429
bone basics before that like calling

515
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,950
someone in at the end that is the most

516
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,080
expensive way I mean it's the second

517
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,330
second most expensive way the most

518
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,250
expensive way is to have an actual

519
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,310
security incident that would be way

520
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,990
worse but it's much better if we start

521
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,330
security earlier we do security the

522
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,490
whole way through and we support the

523
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,399
developers for the cost of a pen test

524
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,780
you can do a lot of app sack

525
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,050
I don't mean we shouldn't ever do them

526
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:17,790
that's not what I mean so there's this

527
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:20,370
guy people are always asking me like if

528
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,639
that's who I work with I don't know

529
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:26,939
about you but I don't work with this guy

530
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,620
and I run this thing every Monday he's

531
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,480
to be called mentoring Monday and now

532
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,090
it's cyber mentoring Monday because the

533
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,800
hashtag got so big everyone started

534
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,260
using it and then it got we got drowned

535
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,659
out so now we have our own hashtag cyber

536
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,490
mentoring Monday and when I first

537
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,410
started this people just only asked

538
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,510
about becoming a pen tester but all

539
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,090
anyone asked for the first six six

540
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,710
months and so I wrote an article about

541
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,990
all the different types of jobs in

542
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,970
application security and it turns out oh

543
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,460
I want to be an instant responder oh I

544
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,080
want to do forensics I want to do so

545
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,570
they just didn't know those jobs exist

546
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,120
so part of our problem with like

547
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,830
constantly glorifying only one job is

548
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,989
that people think that's the only job

549
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,600
they can have like I became a pen tester

550
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,510
having no idea that I had the option of

551
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,780
doing at SAC lab SEC it turns out that's

552
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,100
where I'm meant to be and if we don't

553
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,810
tell people about all these different

554
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,879
types of jobs like we could miss out on

555
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,520
people who would be amazing instant

556
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,350
responders right and all the other types

557
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,660
of jobs and we need people doing all of

558
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:32,310
them okay so now I'm not going to talk

559
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,070
to you about Lois I just love this

560
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:38,159
graphic this really amazing artist

561
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:40,889
Ashley Willis made this for me with

562
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,290
permission from a wasp and it is so

563
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,220
gorgeous and when I don't know what to

564
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,200
do or I'm lost I I tweet it that I'm I'm

565
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,000
asking help from Oh ass and just all

566
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,710
these people from the community come and

567
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,360
like help me solve my tech problem it's

568
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,960
super amazing and I was joking with her

569
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,729
that I just turn on the bat-signal and

570
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,110
then she made this beautiful image and

571
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,990
it's open source so you can like print

572
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,129
it and stick it somewhere if you want to

573
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,640
but what I'm actually going to talk to

574
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:12,900
you about is modern application security

575
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,910
so modern apps need modern approaches

576
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,520
and this is basically what the purple

577
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:21,660
team does all day so I'm going to talk

578
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,540
about a whole bunch of different new

579
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,160
Tech and then what we have to do to

580
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,230
secure it so I'm gonna explain what each

581
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,670
one of the tech things are so even if

582
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,630
you're like I don't work with software

583
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,220
it's okay

584
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,470
you could still learn about like what

585
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:39,120
server lissa is and all of that so don't

586
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:41,550
run away just yet okay so zero trust so

587
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,370
back in the day when security started

588
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,800
what we would do is we would just put a

589
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:49,649
giant firewall around everything a big

590
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,510
wall and not let people through and you

591
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:55,500
know our apps would stick edge people

592
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:57,629
could see the apps and that's it and we

593
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,820
would just trust everyone inside if

594
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,830
you're inside the firewall we just

595
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,320
assumed you were good and what this led

596
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,490
to is first of all insider threats could

597
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,379
do whatever they wanted but also if

598
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,930
someone managed to get in past your

599
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,720
firewall they would have access to every

600
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:17,460
single thing in your entire org and so

601
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,830
someone came up with the idea of zero

602
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,540
trust which was popularized by Google

603
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,199
and the idea is is you don't trust

604
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,879
anyone ever always verify so you know

605
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,780
they say like trust but verify no trust

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,360
no trust just verify forget that and so

607
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,370
this could be in your network design but

608
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,800
this could also be for instance between

609
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,600
applications like if you have a server

610
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,120
with sap that calls another server lasat

611
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,709
it still needs to authenticate right

612
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,179
because I could be a jerk that's broken

613
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,950
into your network and then I think I

614
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,620
call it all right

615
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,810
so between your applications within your

616
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,060
application the way that you set up your

617
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,040
configuration so for instance like we

618
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,870
used to just leave all of our ports open

619
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,480
like well I might want to tone that in

620
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,100
some day know close everything unless

621
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,420
you know you need to use it and then

622
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,179
just open it when you're using it and

623
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,550
close it after okay and the way you

624
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,060
design your network is where zero trust

625
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:15,680
is is seen the most but basically only

626
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:19,530
trust after you have authenticated and

627
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,630
authorized so hand-in-hand with zero

628
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,180
trust is a sane breach so this means

629
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:28,140
designing things in a way where you

630
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:30,180
assume that you have been breached so an

631
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,610
example of this

632
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,980
it means design and react in a way as

633
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,809
though you have been breached so

634
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,760
if for instance you have a critical bug

635
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,519
reported to you and you're running a bug

636
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,940
bounty program an assumed breach tactic

637
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,639
would be that you run your entire

638
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,679
incident response protocol as though it

639
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,779
was an event and you're not sure if

640
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,690
you've been breached and go verify that

641
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,309
you haven't because that security

642
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,730
researcher might have been the seventh

643
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:00,928
person to find that problem right the

644
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,580
person that reports it to you it could

645
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,110
have been in like people could have been

646
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,840
exploiting that for a year you have no

647
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,309
idea and so that's the assume breach

648
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,908
mentality and if you do those two

649
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:10,500
together

650
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:14,450
things are just locked down nice and

651
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,730
tight another new so a new type of tech

652
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:20,610
is serverless and logic acts so logic

653
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,620
app is a trigger and the only thing it

654
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,689
does is call serverless apps so logic

655
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,518
apps are generally in the cloud so if

656
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,880
something an activity happens in the

657
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:35,250
cloud and it senses it then it logs it

658
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,470
triggers the logic app which calls the

659
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,230
service app so let's say someone has

660
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,299
tried to log in 10 times in under one

661
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,279
second so that's probably not person

662
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,049
that's probably a bot and so it could

663
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:48,389
trigger the logic app and the logic app

664
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:51,658
it's like I know what to do we call this

665
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:54,449
service act a server this app is an app

666
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,210
that does not sit on a server all the

667
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,210
time that's why it's called surplice it

668
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,559
is dormant and then when it is called it

669
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,440
explodes a container

670
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,678
runs itself to completion and it could

671
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,139
mean installing software running updates

672
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,539
doing a test spitting out the results

673
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:14,010
into a report and then once it's done

674
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,289
wherever it's supposed to do it

675
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,750
self-destructs destroys the container

676
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:21,629
and gives back all of the resources that

677
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,330
it was using and this saves tons of

678
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,149
money so if you have a server less app

679
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,158
and it only runs nine minutes a month

680
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:31,110
like if you were running a virtual

681
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,269
machine that might be 50 bucks and the

682
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,889
cloud for the whole month but if you are

683
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:37,169
just running this container for nine

684
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:41,969
minutes it could be like I don't know

685
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:44,010
any less and pretty exciting and so

686
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,510
there are some things that we need to

687
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,600
know about server lists and logic apps

688
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:51,620
so first of all do

689
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,649
forget AB SEC so all of the same things

690
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,178
apply so if you have a circle as app it

691
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,760
still needs to authenticate two things

692
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,400
you can't automatically trust it right

693
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,010
and it needs to be authenticated too as

694
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,140
well so if it is supposed to connect to

695
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,770
an API it needs to know like if

696
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:13,309
something calls it sometimes when we do

697
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:15,530
new tech which is totally for everything

698
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:16,250
at the window input validation why would

699
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,770
I do that

700
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,770
you still need to always validate input

701
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,280
no matter where it's coming from and so

702
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:27,590
please don't forget yourself but on top

703
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,870
of that okay so some of the things that

704
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,939
you should do that are not brand new

705
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,010
like you should log and monitor your

706
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,539
functions people forget that a lot so if

707
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,330
you have a server let's have a logic

708
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:39,830
happen if I'm an incident responder or

709
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,720
you've had a big incident and you don't

710
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,129
have any logging omona during setup then

711
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,440
that means I have nothing to investigate

712
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,470
and as an instant responder I am pretty

713
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,720
upset if you use secure coding

714
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:55,400
conventions for your application code I

715
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,700
know you should use them you don't stop

716
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,799
um and also you want to encrypt all your

717
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,390
data in transit and at rest sometimes

718
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,240
people just forget those those three

719
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:08,240
things specifically but improvements

720
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,940
modern improvements would include use an

721
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,650
API Gateway as a security buffer so

722
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,820
don't let people call your server less

723
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,570
apps unless they're going through a

724
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:20,780
gateway monitor and log your stuff but

725
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,549
then like a newer thing which has been

726
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,340
possible for a long time but people are

727
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:27,530
starting to do it is send those logs to

728
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,689
the sim if you have a security

729
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:33,080
information and event management system

730
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,000
a sim sending the stuff from your apps

731
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,480
to it it's not just for networks it's

732
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,780
for everyone all of the tech toys can be

733
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,830
like if they can log the sim can absorb

734
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,629
it um if you work if your logic app or

735
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,668
so that was a poor gonna use secrets

736
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,650
they should not be stored inside your

737
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:54,190
server list they should store it in a

738
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:58,700
secret store and access programmatically

739
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:00,530
um you should deploy functions with

740
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,910
minimal granularity

741
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,770
so basically a serverless app should

742
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,630
just do one thing it shouldn't do 500

743
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,280
things it shouldn't be like a full giant

744
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,990
application and you shouldn't be calling

745
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,110
like five hundred times a day in which

746
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:15,560
case you need a regular uh-huh

747
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:19,129
and lastly maintain isolated parameters

748
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:22,460
or parameters and isolated function

749
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:26,420
parameters means basically zero trusts

750
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,790
so what happens a lot is that a service

751
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,140
app will call another service app and

752
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,510
we'll have no identification or

753
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,510
authorization and if I am a bad person

754
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:37,550
now I am on your network I'm gonna try

755
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,690
to call your service apps and if they

756
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,659
don't have a tenth occasion or

757
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,950
authorization that means I can and I

758
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,170
could do all sorts of things to them

759
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,150
even if I just call them on a script

760
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:52,160
over and over so that you can't use them

761
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:54,200
it could be damaging okay next

762
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,960
third-party component in library

763
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,660
management software supply chain

764
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,680
security some are tweets somewhere

765
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:06,530
between 60 and 80 or 90% of all the code

766
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,110
in your app is not code that your team

767
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,990
wrote it's actually libraries or

768
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:15,260
frameworks dependencies components

769
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:18,260
anything anything else that is code that

770
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,110
you didn't write it's still risking you

771
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,410
are accepting and that can be quite

772
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:26,030
problematic and so we call that your

773
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,980
supply chain so it's all the things that

774
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,120
you use to make up your software like

775
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,250
the things you use to build your

776
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,800
software so all those things need to be

777
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,870
secure as well and so some people call

778
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,200
this open source security

779
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:42,560
however the dotnet framework is not open

780
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,710
source its proprietary I still care if

781
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,720
it's secure the old versions of the

782
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,400
framework have lots of vulnerabilities

783
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,020
and so you still want to make sure

784
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,100
you're on the right version that's most

785
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,110
secure I suggest using multiple tools to

786
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:01,250
verify if your components are known to

787
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,800
be secure because each team like each

788
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:08,060
security company gets the information

789
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,669
from a different place so I suggest you

790
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,429
scan your repository regularly like

791
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:15,010
maybe once a week

792
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,410
to look to see if a component has become

793
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,600
vulnerable and you didn't know so people

794
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,360
know if you're using framework bla bla

795
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,919
bla point three people may have been

796
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,419
looking at that for three years and

797
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,210
maybe after two years they found a

798
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,340
vulnerability and then it is exploitable

799
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,370
and you're still using it and that's

800
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:36,909
disconcerting another thing you can do

801
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,439
is there are IV e plugins so the IDE is

802
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,270
the place where programmers program all

803
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,309
day and there are plugins that will

804
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,400
proxy between their package management

805
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:47,470
and their IDE and only show them the

806
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,660
packages that are known to be secure

807
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,220
like pre-approved one so this means they

808
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,000
can never using insecure one in the

809
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,550
first place that is awesome sauce

810
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,770
another thing you can and/or should do

811
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:03,639
is if you are releasing code in an

812
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:06,100
automated pipeline see ICD pipeline scan

813
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,050
there it is a super quick scan because

814
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,270
it's not actually evaluating the code

815
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,480
it's just looking oh they have version

816
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,940
3.1 point two of this oh yeah that's not

817
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,610
known to be vulnerable good to go it's

818
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:21,510
very quick check very high accuracy and

819
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:23,070
it's yeah it's really really hopeful

820
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:28,389
okay

821
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:36,300
whom Crown Jewels online storage must be

822
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:38,610
tickets at the water you're on

823
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,380
storage holds your data and your data is

824
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:45,510
extremely valuable it is so we

825
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,700
definitely want to so if you're using

826
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:50,730
the cloud and you're using online

827
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:53,520
storage you can create in all of the

828
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:56,610
major public cloud providers you can

829
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,040
create templates and policies so that

830
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,510
every new container or online storage

831
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,480
bucket or whatever you want to call them

832
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,840
is locked down by default all of them

833
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,880
now like so Amazon was the first public

834
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,740
cloud there are lots of you know jokes

835
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,680
about oh they have an open s3 bucket

836
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,120
etcetera so Amazon learned from that all

837
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,299
the cloud providers learned from that

838
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,540
and all of the defaults containers now

839
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,280
are secure at the start so you have to

840
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,980
peel off the security so if you have a

841
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,600
template that everyone follows you can

842
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,830
have it be even more lockdown than that

843
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,250
if you want to and then it's just

844
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:34,529
effortless right another thing I feel we

845
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,360
should do is classify our data so say

846
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,910
like this is public or this is private

847
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,540
or this is confidential or this is you

848
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:45,779
know top secret if you do that then

849
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,090
incident responders again can either you

850
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,130
know freak out and meltdown or breathe a

851
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,680
sigh of relief oh that information is

852
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,180
not actually sensitive at all so I mean

853
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,740
I still have to take this seriously it's

854
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,790
an incident but I don't need to follow

855
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:02,250
all of my hair another thing is you

856
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,860
should monitor access to these so online

857
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,620
storage generally only be accessed by

858
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,390
computers and software and other systems

859
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:12,480
human beings shouldn't be fiddling

860
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,940
around in there generally so you want to

861
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,010
make sure that you are monitoring it you

862
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,860
turn on file integrity monitoring as

863
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,550
well if there's ports nothing happening

864
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,500
you need to have automated alerts at the

865
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,540
very least and those alerts should be

866
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,720
going to the sense cuz someone sees it

867
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,520
immediately and if you can you could add

868
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,049
an automated response so the cloud

869
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:40,640
allows a lot of automation responses I'm

870
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:43,740
oh yes and these containers are storage

871
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,790
buckets and should only be accessed by

872
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,359
service accounts so service account Oh

873
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,509
as

874
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,098
service account is basically an account

875
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:56,220
used by computers to talk to other

876
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:59,880
computers so it's not Tanya's account so

877
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,769
that means like if I quit it'll still

878
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,759
keep working because you know like app

879
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:08,488
ABCs service account is talking to you

880
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:11,369
know the storage account for app ABC but

881
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:14,279
if it's Tanya's accounts and then Tonya

882
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:16,829
leaves that's a problem right also if

883
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,880
you see Tanya's account trying to access

884
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:19,019
it in the middle of the night you know

885
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,279
there's probably something wrong with

886
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:25,788
Tanya's account yes so containers and

887
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:29,640
orchestration is next

888
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:33,269
so containers are really really really

889
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,970
small operating systems we used to have

890
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:38,819
giant physical servers we call it bare

891
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:42,720
metal and you would have one operating

892
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:46,980
system run on one server then someone or

893
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,879
a whole bunch of people invented hyper

894
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:53,160
vision and the idea of virtualizing

895
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,749
servers then we had virtual machines all

896
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,839
sorts of virtual machines so you could

897
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:59,488
have let's say four or six operating

898
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,640
systems running separately and

899
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:07,410
independently all on the same server

900
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:09,480
totally awesome then came containers so

901
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,730
an operating system is huge like Windows

902
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,079
is huge it's like two gigs of hard drive

903
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,710
space and two gigs of memory

904
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,269
Gigantor but container only contains the

905
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,430
absolute mandatory parts of the

906
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:22,709
operating system that you need in order

907
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,960
to run your app so if you're running a

908
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,239
little tiny script you really don't need

909
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,390
that much to run it so instead of being

910
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,890
to Gay's it could be four Meg's it could

911
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,529
be much much smaller and that means we

912
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,058
could run hundreds on a server and when

913
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:38,160
you have cloud and you have all sorts of

914
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,599
servers all working together like you

915
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,058
could just take out this really small

916
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,380
space and run hundreds of things however

917
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,089
if you have hundreds of containers

918
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,950
someone needs to manage all that and

919
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:49,859
that's where orchestration comes in so

920
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,689
orchestration systems what they do and

921
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,519
the most famous one is cuber Nettie's I

922
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,349
usually try really hard not to like name

923
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,779
lots of products but kubernetes has just

924
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:59,640
totally taken over the market um but the

925
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:01,560
idea is it manages all of that for you

926
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,020
so it launches new ones it managed

927
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,090
memory it it shuts things down and it

928
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,860
just like if you imagine an orchestra

929
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,080
it's like the director running

930
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,450
everything and so that's what containers

931
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,490
are little tiny operating systems and

932
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,120
our constriction the thing managing all

933
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:20,310
the containers guess what you need to do

934
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:24,150
keep doing security that you would

935
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,860
always do for some reason people are

936
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,450
like oh I made a container I don't need

937
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,690
to close the ports or do anything like

938
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,689
that

939
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,580
yet you know all the same security

940
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:35,880
things that you would do for a VM you

941
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,890
need to do them for those but on top of

942
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,810
that there are a few extra things that

943
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:43,620
are different and so because you know

944
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,270
containers and orchestration are

945
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,100
different there's new configuration

946
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,930
rules that you need to learn and then

947
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,910
tools that you need to learn but they do

948
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,799
that they check the same types of things

949
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,509
right they're still looking over your

950
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,920
configurations they're still testing to

951
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,230
see that things are closed that should

952
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,150
be closed there's new types of

953
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,590
vulnerabilities to watch out for so for

954
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,270
instance if there's a container of

955
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,160
course someone's gonna try to escape it

956
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,280
if there's a virtual machine of course

957
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,750
someone's gonna try to escape it right

958
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,260
but it will be a different vulnerability

959
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:15,510
let's get to pay attention specifically

960
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,830
with containers and orchestration the

961
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,380
biggest thing that you want to watch out

962
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:21,870
for is protecting who can create or edit

963
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,970
containers you really want to make sure

964
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,670
that you lock that down that is theme

965
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:29,009
it's the crown it's um it's the keys to

966
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,660
the kingdom really the only the only

967
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,300
mark important keys are the keys to your

968
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,450
cloud instance I'm still be very careful

969
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,400
with who can do that with basically it's

970
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,640
a very similar approach we would take

971
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,890
two virtual machines so scan check your

972
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,480
config patch regularly or just

973
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,990
completely replace it with a new version

974
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,670
that is secure and apply zero trust to

975
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,279
your configuration and your design I

976
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,140
know that's easier said than done not

977
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,700
saying that it's not hard work but I'm

978
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,339
saying you kind of have to do all the

979
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:04,069
same things but with new rules and you

980
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:09,540
can do it so API is and micro services

981
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:12,750
so an API is basically a web app with no

982
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:15,089
front end there's just no GUI so it has

983
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,640
all the back stuff that runs on a server

984
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:20,519
and then it gets cold sometimes it gets

985
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,038
called from a mobile app sometimes it

986
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,439
gets called you know by a web app front

987
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,710
end sometimes it gets called by other

988
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,509
api's and basically an API can do

989
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:33,420
everything that the back end of a web

990
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:36,900
app can do and a micro-service is an API

991
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:40,049
but it just does one single thing so

992
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,029
let's say I'm writing an app and it

993
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:44,130
looks up addresses based on postal code

994
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:46,410
so I'd probably use a micro service to

995
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,299
look up the postal code because all the

996
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,069
other people where I work they probably

997
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:52,049
also have to look up addresses and

998
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:54,479
postal codes so then everyone can use

999
00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:56,130
that API not just me and all I need to

1000
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,979
do is go the database and say okay so

1001
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,920
this postal code just send back their

1002
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:03,839
address right so then all of us can use

1003
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,309
it instead of just us rewriting that

1004
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,538
same functionality over and over again

1005
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:12,630
in each app ok so api's web apps with no

1006
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:15,119
front end no GUI micro services tiny

1007
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,990
tiny tiny api's they just do one single

1008
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,630
thing okay so yes

1009
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,819
gonna say you still have to follow all

1010
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,890
the same best practices in regards to

1011
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,230
application security you still need to

1012
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,940
sanitize your input you don't need to

1013
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,010
encode your output because you don't

1014
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,720
output to the screen you still have to

1015
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,220
do basically everything else that's like

1016
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,100
the only way that's the only one that

1017
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,379
you don't have to do stuff about so

1018
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,540
don't forget all your best practices I'm

1019
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,970
mentioning it because many many people

1020
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:49,050
do I do you still do pen test then oh

1021
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:52,560
gosh but there's more there's more stuff

1022
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,080
that's very specific for api's um so

1023
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,490
there is a thing called service mesh um

1024
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,980
I have for the win

1025
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,959
beside it it's a service mash remember I

1026
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,440
talked about orchestration you know it

1027
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,510
manages and does everything for all your

1028
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,210
containers well serviced mash does this

1029
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,810
for api's so it manages things it

1030
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:15,720
manages it also encrypts everything so

1031
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,509
it's a layer of infrastructure and your

1032
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,279
apps go through it and it just protects

1033
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,850
everything and manages them and it's

1034
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:26,010
pretty great standardization and

1035
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,500
templating I have seen so many places

1036
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:32,070
where each API is slightly different no

1037
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,290
you should all follow the same format

1038
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,790
for calling your API so that's easier to

1039
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,670
test and it's easier to make sure that

1040
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:42,140
things are going correctly if they're

1041
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:46,859
all different that is that sounds awful

1042
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,310
strict linting of how your API is are

1043
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:50,460
called

1044
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:54,570
so linting is like grammar police for

1045
00:43:50,460 --> 00:44:00,780
your code so it does not allow what is

1046
00:43:54,570 --> 00:44:03,570
the word it does not allow for like

1047
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,060
poetic license so for instance if you're

1048
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:09,060
supposed to define you know this is a

1049
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,750
string some programming languages it can

1050
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,490
just tell

1051
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,619
but lynching won't allow that because

1052
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:16,229
uncertainty is where we end up having

1053
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,910
security problems and so ensure strict

1054
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,619
lensing so if someone is going to delete

1055
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,589
something they should call the delete

1056
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:25,700
function right and they should use that

1057
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:27,750
call in HTTP they shouldn't use a put

1058
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,669
because then you don't have the

1059
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:34,720
protection of the delete HTTP request

1060
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:36,040
and so if you initiate linting it will

1061
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,240
just check for all those things and make

1062
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,980
sure you're following the rules and

1063
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,399
there's no one being creative with the

1064
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,290
way things are being used modeling in

1065
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,390
bruisers Kota which is something that I

1066
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,000
believe service match or API gateways

1067
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:52,450
can help with basically throttling means

1068
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,310
slowing stuff down so if you know

1069
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,720
someone's trying to log in and they keep

1070
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,540
failing and they keep failing on the

1071
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:01,000
keep failing well maybe you should slow

1072
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,860
them down and then resource quotas means

1073
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,740
when you hit a certain number just cut

1074
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,270
them off you don't want people abusing

1075
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,060
your API so you don't want them calling

1076
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,920
them over and over and over again

1077
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,420
because that is a disaster and that's

1078
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,250
not going to go well and it's gonna be

1079
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,130
expensive

1080
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:21,160
um I crossed on you to authenticate and

1081
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,230
then to authorize so make sure first you

1082
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,580
know who you're talking to and then go

1083
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,140
check what they are allowed to do

1084
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,770
because if you can't figure out who

1085
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,020
you're talking to

1086
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:33,790
there's no need to go any further in

1087
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:37,540
your code hi Dwight you Kenny so by this

1088
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:40,720
I mean so like a a lot of apps and

1089
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:43,750
especially api's will say oh you pulled

1090
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,759
us wrong you're supposed to do this when

1091
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,160
you be able this extra information you

1092
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,290
are giving that to hackers you're giving

1093
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,600
that to malicious actors or security

1094
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:55,410
testers who are looking at it and trying

1095
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,000
to exploit it a computer calls correctly

1096
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,710
that's what happens it always calls the

1097
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,900
same way it doesn't make him escaped or

1098
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,490
a typo and so if it's calling it

1099
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,560
incorrectly and you're like oh no this

1100
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,569
is the format don't give some before

1101
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:11,440
that make some guess make it painful

1102
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:13,720
um and lastly you should wait lists so

1103
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,840
this goes for all apps but if I throw it

1104
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,149
in here um wait list your approved HTTP

1105
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:22,210
methods or votes and then block the rest

1106
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,550
so a lot of people use post and get and

1107
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,580
sometimes delete people don't usually

1108
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:30,880
use tracer head if you are not using the

1109
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,950
other HTTP methods block all of them

1110
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,410
don't let anyone call those things

1111
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,330
because you're not using them and

1112
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:42,250
therefore zero trust it don't allow it

1113
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:43,810
boom okay so I'm going to have a little

1114
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,860
bit more water and then I'm going to

1115
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,840
tell you about a whole bunch of

1116
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:52,120
different modern tooling options I know

1117
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,430
this talk is long I just couldn't cut

1118
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,990
myself off I was just like no but I also

1119
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:59,500
need to cover this and I also need to

1120
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:04,810
cover that I'm sorry if your brains I'm

1121
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:07,090
melting okay some modern cooling so this

1122
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,710
is a list of some modern cooling that I

1123
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,340
just want you to be aware of that it

1124
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,170
exists

1125
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,240
I'm not telling you to go buy it or that

1126
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,160
you need it but if you don't know what

1127
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,839
options you have then you don't know

1128
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,009
what opportunities that you might have

1129
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,240
and I want you to have all the

1130
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,440
opportunities ok so I asked

1131
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,830
Interactive's application security

1132
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,910
testing so this is a stub that goes into

1133
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:32,560
your application it's a binary and it

1134
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:36,549
interacts with your app as people are

1135
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,860
using it and so it only runs over the

1136
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:40,810
parts of your app that are actually used

1137
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,550
by your users so if you could run it

1138
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,970
during quality assurance testing or a

1139
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:48,970
pen test that would be great it's a mix

1140
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:50,410
of dynamic and Static application

1141
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,230
security testing like it looks at some

1142
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:55,990
code and it looks at like how your app

1143
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:59,500
runs but then weird of this is that it

1144
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:02,500
basically it's a binary it's in your app

1145
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,240
and that it only tests the parts of your

1146
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,100
apps are actually used so there's a lot

1147
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,649
onslaught of code that never gets run

1148
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:11,680
and act and so it won't test any of that

1149
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:14,350
just test the used part the next one is

1150
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,259
rasp runtime application security

1151
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,870
protection again it is a stud of a

1152
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,300
binary that goes in your app and it

1153
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:26,770
usually calls out to the cloud so it is

1154
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:29,860
a shield for your app the idea is it's a

1155
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:33,040
bit so it doesn't work at all the way a

1156
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,350
web app firewall a laff works like the

1157
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,029
same concept it's a shield so it looks

1158
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,799
at all the input coming into your app

1159
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,470
and then evaluates us if it looks like

1160
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,720
an attack or not and so while a what

1161
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,299
half a first generation of this type of

1162
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,060
tool would just use tons and tons of

1163
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,700
regular expression and it's way way out

1164
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,980
on the web server so it's far from your

1165
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:57,040
app it will create a fair amount of

1166
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:00,010
latency and sometimes false positive

1167
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:02,140
well a rasp is rate inside your

1168
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:04,420
application it's a binary it runs very

1169
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:07,359
fast and then it calls out to the clouds

1170
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,280
sometimes and they say they have AI and

1171
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,180
I know and those are really important

1172
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,820
buzzwords for marketing so it's supposed

1173
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,830
to be a lot more effective

1174
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,150
Kyle integrity monitoring which goes

1175
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,720
hand-in-hand with application

1176
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,110
whitelisting

1177
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,899
so file integrity monitoring is making

1178
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:28,000
sure that the files on your system do

1179
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,820
not change specifically usually the

1180
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,830
system files and application

1181
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,470
whitelisting means only these apps there

1182
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:38,740
on this approved list are allowed to run

1183
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:41,980
and the idea of using them in tandem is

1184
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,990
that if if malware gets onto your

1185
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,580
computer like onto your server the first

1186
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,439
thing it does is it tries to start

1187
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,720
itself and it won't be on the approved

1188
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,700
list of apps so the application

1189
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,560
whitelisting will stop it and the second

1190
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,839
thing it will do is it will try to

1191
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,180
change its name to like a file system

1192
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,920
name and the file integrity monitoring

1193
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,970
stop that and then it's just dead in its

1194
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,310
tracks I gave a hard drive once so we

1195
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,649
had done like a security investigation

1196
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:10,210
for something that happened and we had

1197
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,160
to like there was a bunch of people

1198
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:15,910
infected and so he gave them all the

1199
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,290
stuff to the team to look at and one of

1200
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:22,810
the hard drives came back and they said

1201
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:24,250
hey so um you know like because the they

1202
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,930
weren't in fact it turned out was fine

1203
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,940
it's a long story but anyway the point

1204
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:28,960
is is there I go this hard drive has a

1205
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,960
Trojan on it

1206
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,490
so you need to firm at it first it's

1207
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,780
infected with malware I'm like okay I

1208
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,060
thought it was fine and they're like it

1209
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,190
is fine because you have file integrity

1210
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,380
monitoring and application whitelisting

1211
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,210
it's hopeless I can't do anything but

1212
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,920
we'd like you to format it you know even

1213
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,390
though it's helpless like just in case

1214
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:51,340
something weird happens and I said oh

1215
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:55,890
cool it worked cloud native controls so

1216
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:59,110
these are software or services created

1217
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:02,230
specifically and optimized for the cloud

1218
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:04,240
they don't work on Prem some of them are

1219
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:05,860
created by the cloud providers some are

1220
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,859
created by third parties but the idea is

1221
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,580
there a specific

1222
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:14,650
for public cloud adding security tools

1223
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:17,060
to your data pipeline so this should say

1224
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:20,300
regular application security tooling

1225
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:22,250
that has been optimized for pipelines be

1226
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,230
careful with this one because a lot of

1227
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,960
vendors are singing that they're

1228
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,040
old-school tools are totally adopted but

1229
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,840
they haven't changed anything and

1230
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,100
they'll break all your stuff and slow

1231
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,650
everything down and make people unhappy

1232
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,660
um but some of them have reinvented

1233
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,700
themselves and then there's lots of

1234
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,980
really cool new devops tools coming out

1235
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,419
from security companies really really

1236
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,710
cool things coming that aren't quite

1237
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,470
ready yet so I can't put them on the

1238
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:48,550
slide things like automate at least

1239
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:51,230
privilege and I'm trying to think of

1240
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,000
also like Princeton's chaining a whole

1241
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:55,040
bunch of security tools together but

1242
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,650
just having it run as one place and then

1243
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,690
like having it HTA honestly run all the

1244
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,310
other tools for you on your Kobe's like

1245
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:05,140
there's lots of cool things coming from

1246
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:08,090
a lot of really cool companies

1247
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:11,120
customizable alerts automated responses

1248
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,170
if you are in cloud you can organize

1249
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,810
things like this with your cloud

1250
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,660
provider and they have system setups

1251
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:19,070
that you can make your own and

1252
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:21,319
application inventory tools so this has

1253
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,900
exploded in the past a year and a half

1254
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,570
it is really hard having accurate and

1255
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,130
current list of all of your apps and so

1256
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,480
there are companies now making tools to

1257
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,850
help you do this and that is

1258
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,800
ridiculously cool because when I did

1259
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,710
that sexual time that was like the

1260
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:40,910
hardest thing in the world

1261
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:42,500
modern tactics so these are different

1262
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,069
new ways people are doing things so

1263
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,560
adding security tools to your pipeline

1264
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:53,090
taking unit tests and making negative or

1265
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:56,600
abuse case unit tests breaking security

1266
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:58,430
activities into smaller Sprint's so if

1267
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,170
your developers are releasing code every

1268
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,700
three weeks making sure that your

1269
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:03,020
testing takes less than three weeks and

1270
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,200
that you can get them results in that

1271
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:08,450
time turning penetration test results

1272
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,680
into unit tests to make sure that those

1273
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:14,240
problems never come back I realize that

1274
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,830
tuning tools for automation and

1275
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,450
efficiency should be really obvious but

1276
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,490
it appears that people are doing it now

1277
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:21,399
more than the

1278
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:24,100
- automated or posit or a scanning

1279
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,450
that's nice your coats just sitting

1280
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,220
there you might as well run every

1281
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:30,609
security test on it that you can because

1282
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,830
it doesn't do any harm there's so many

1283
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:34,210
modern tactics and I would be here old

1284
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,900
egg

1285
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:39,610
okay so def sec ops my favorite topic

1286
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,119
this is application security in a DevOps

1287
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:44,970
environment there's many parts to it so

1288
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,070
adding security tooling to your pipeline

1289
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:50,560
ensuring fast feedback from the security

1290
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:52,930
team making everyone when a teaching

1291
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,869
moment I actually talked about this

1292
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,879
quite a bit so this is a little link to

1293
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:59,890
another long extended talk where that's

1294
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,140
all I talk about I just wanted to make

1295
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,819
sure that you know that I'm skipping it

1296
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,779
on purpose because otherwise we'd be

1297
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,560
here all day

1298
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:10,420
okay so cloud security yeah you can't

1299
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,650
just talk about cloud in every talk I

1300
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:17,530
know but some apps live in the cloud and

1301
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:21,100
I feel that it's really really important

1302
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:23,440
that you as an app set professional make

1303
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,700
sure you know a bit of cloud if you're

1304
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,470
going to work in a place that's using

1305
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:30,250
cloud otherwise I feel you're not quite

1306
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:31,390
doing all of your jobs and life will

1307
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,750
this be easier if you know what's going

1308
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:36,580
on okay so this is a summary of this

1309
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,170
section and then we have a little bit

1310
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:40,869
left I'm sorry I'm going slightly long

1311
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:44,530
um but we started 10 minutes early so

1312
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:45,820
we're not like yet okay so now I want to

1313
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:50,070
talk about automating the boring stuff

1314
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:52,090
this is the last part we learned a code

1315
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,790
because we did not want to do things

1316
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:56,410
back under times right you don't want to

1317
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:58,810
do things manually we don't want boring

1318
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:01,569
work we don't want to have errors we

1319
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:03,910
want to make everything faster my friend

1320
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:07,750
Steve Moravsky made this slide he's

1321
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:11,830
awesome and he taught me about toil so

1322
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:14,950
toiled toil stinks the idea of toil is

1323
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:18,520
that it's manual repeatable automatable

1324
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:22,750
tactical it is devoid of enduring value

1325
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:26,080
and it scales literally so it means like

1326
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:27,850
if it takes me all night to do 10 that

1327
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,970
means it's me and my friend all night to

1328
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:32,089
do 20 as opposed to if I work heard all

1329
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,379
night to automate it

1330
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:37,520
then you never need anyone to do it

1331
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,050
again and so that's our automation comes

1332
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,480
in

1333
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:43,490
you should automate every single thing

1334
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,670
you can the timer takes you to automate

1335
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:48,140
it will be so so valuable for you

1336
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,420
because you will have reduced errors

1337
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,190
they'll make your table more enjoyable

1338
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,220
so you're not doing boring like manual

1339
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,870
chores but you'll just you'll be able to

1340
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,839
get so much more done in the rest of

1341
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:01,700
your job so options for this are you

1342
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,280
know using pipeline soft water if your

1343
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,710
dev and ops team are using them creating

1344
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,480
your own pipeline where you run lots of

1345
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,040
security tools that take a long time to

1346
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,340
run but it doesn't actually release any

1347
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:16,040
code anywhere you can do infrastructures

1348
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,600
code and security is code so if they're

1349
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,310
doing infrastructures code you can add

1350
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,410
all your security configurations and

1351
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:25,070
things to it and then test their code

1352
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:28,839
for security and anything you can do to

1353
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:31,400
automate security for developers is good

1354
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,980
when you automate as much as possible

1355
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,630
you get to do more fun work I mean if

1356
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,940
nothing else like the psych living money

1357
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,010
and saving errors and stuff this means

1358
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,870
you get to work to prevent incidents it

1359
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,640
means you get to upgrade some of your

1360
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:45,440
security defenses or add new ones

1361
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,330
it means you spend less time cleaning up

1362
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,400
messes because you've made less manual

1363
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:51,110
errors

1364
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,500
automation is the key it makes life so

1365
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:56,990
much more better so now I'm going to

1366
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,990
give you some ways that you can continue

1367
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:01,819
to learn so you know this conference

1368
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,339
happens once a year but you need to

1369
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,980
learn all year right so the main

1370
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:09,980
takeaway in this section is that every

1371
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:13,430
moment is a teaching moment so you need

1372
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:17,570
to keep teaching even when it's not fun

1373
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:20,240
so the moment we stop learning we are

1374
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:23,630
left behind even if something bad

1375
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,979
happens that is a great a great time to

1376
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:27,340
make a lesson or if someone does

1377
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,690
something awesome make a lesson of that

1378
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,210
it does not have to be super formal

1379
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:35,630
training like you could give them a link

1380
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,460
to you know cyber e and send them off on

1381
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,620
one of those courses it could be a Lunch

1382
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:43,030
and Learn it could be like an email and

1383
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:45,080
at the end you about cyber tip

1384
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,580
developers and ops folks are going to

1385
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,590
keep

1386
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,830
a new tech whether we like it or not and

1387
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:54,880
they will just go around us if we're not

1388
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:56,980
on board you can create calendar bought

1389
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,530
books for self training so I've done

1390
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:02,140
this with my teams before where you know

1391
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:03,790
every Tuesday from 2:00 to 4:00 we have

1392
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,500
a learning block and we're all supposed

1393
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,610
to be doing self based learning and I

1394
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,230
know some of them just sit there and

1395
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:11,590
answer emails but a bunch of them

1396
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:13,150
learned a lot I used that over the

1397
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,740
course of nine months to complete three

1398
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,770
university courses and I remember my

1399
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:20,500
manager was like whoa but two hours who

1400
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:23,380
I was actually getting one hour but it

1401
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:26,350
just it really worked out job shadowing

1402
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:30,310
mentoring on-the-job learning sharing

1403
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:33,310
information with other teams metric

1404
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,230
space training so you know measuring how

1405
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:37,150
things are doing and then making

1406
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:40,540
training based on like what's going well

1407
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,920
or it's not going well building your own

1408
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,790
training was specific for your

1409
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,980
organization that can be super powerful

1410
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:50,200
okay so I have a quick story the time I

1411
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,900
invents a DevOps it--it incentive house

1412
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,750
and so one of my friends went to see me

1413
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,520
give a talk well know one of my friends

1414
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:00,340
told me someone came back from San

1415
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,080
Francisco after seeing me speak and she

1416
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,810
said yeah so apparently you invented

1417
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,299
DevOps I said what she's like yeah I

1418
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:09,940
seen your tech guy win he hadn't been on

1419
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,250
training in over a decade and he saw her

1420
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,410
talk about Deaf suck-ups and then he

1421
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,820
thinks now that you invented it he

1422
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,420
thinks you invented bops

1423
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:23,950
as a whole he thinks it was you I never

1424
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:26,020
said that and she's like yeah guys in

1425
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,640
charge of projects and design issues and

1426
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,800
he's never heard of DevOps before last

1427
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,040
week when you told him apparently he

1428
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,080
thinks you're really cool the point of

1429
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,640
the story is that we can't not go in

1430
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,350
training for a really long time because

1431
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,940
we will end up with that guy and

1432
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,710
although I think it's awesome that one

1433
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,660
person in the world thinks I invented

1434
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,430
DevOps

1435
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:48,670
it's not really actually very good and

1436
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:50,109
so if you feel you don't have enough

1437
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:52,300
time to go for training and you haven't

1438
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:54,160
gone for training in a long time you're

1439
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,760
probably really billing it to prioritize

1440
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,020
that

1441
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:01,990
okay so conclusion little tiny reins

1442
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,910
I am wicked tired of people thinking of

1443
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:06,899
this guy when they think of our industry

1444
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:10,509
I don't want them to think of this guy

1445
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:12,910
this is what a hacker looks like this is

1446
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,500
what a hacker looks like look in the

1447
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,990
mirror I don't know if you can see other

1448
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:19,090
people's faces on gotowebinar but that

1449
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,770
is what a hacker looks like looks like

1450
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:22,150
anyone it looks like a person who cares

1451
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:26,320
a person that wants to help a person

1452
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:30,100
that wants to protect others I feel if

1453
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,110
we don't open up our idea of what our

1454
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,060
industry looks like we're going to miss

1455
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,770
out on amazing human beings that could

1456
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,380
really help us take it to the next level

1457
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:40,509
so that we actually start winning so

1458
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:46,120
that we stop getting emails from have I

1459
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:48,910
been combed all the time so I beg of you

1460
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,680
to try to keep this in mind that this is

1461
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,470
what a hacker looks like and this and

1462
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,910
what you look like because we really

1463
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,500
really need to open things up if we're

1464
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:59,710
gonna have enough people in our industry

1465
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:02,200
and one more please be nice to software

1466
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:05,260
developers they are our friends in fact

1467
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:08,049
all of IT are our friends we can't do it

1468
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:10,260
without them I've seen so many security

1469
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:13,060
people need mean to software developers

1470
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:14,860
because they you know have bugs in their

1471
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,750
software or like went around something

1472
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,390
please be nice to them we need them we

1473
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:22,810
need them on our side without them we

1474
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:24,580
are so screwed and so that is the end of

1475
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:26,490
my rant and now I'm going to give you

1476
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,650
free resources so you can keep learning

1477
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:32,020
so I believe Halifax has it an OS

1478
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:34,810
chapter that's like sort of half started

1479
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:37,660
so if you someone wants to restart it

1480
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:39,870
but you can also join all of the tons of

1481
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:42,399
virtual meetings online Ottawa and

1482
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:44,230
Vancouver are both having lots and lots

1483
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,090
of online meetings right now they're

1484
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,760
open to everyone you could learn a ton

1485
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,500
of cool new things I was probably a

1486
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:54,160
better time slot for you than Vancouver

1487
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:56,230
be pretty late for you but definitely I

1488
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,200
love a loss I can't say enough good

1489
01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:00,640
things about them if you are a woman or

1490
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,770
identify as a woman

1491
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,250
well Seth welcomes you there is a very

1492
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:10,570
active chapter and you can eat Karen and

1493
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:12,530
Megan and yeah so we we welcome you to

1494

01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:19,830
and Cybermen Monday every Monday if you

1496
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:22,410
have worked in industry for two or more

1497
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:24,779
years you know enough to be a mentor

1498
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:27,450
there's someone who wishes they knew

1499
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,910
enough to do your job sending them a

1500
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:31,680
book recommendation or a blog post or

1501
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,480
having a virtual coffee with them like a

1502
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,770
zoom session and talking out what

1503
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,690
they're looking for and just sending

1504
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:38,460
them off in the right direction these

1505
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,860
are the things that will make people

1506
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,780
join our industry and I cannot tell you

1507
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,910
how much it means to someone a newcomer

1508
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:47,520
to have someone take time for them and

1509
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:50,279
try to help them along and if you are

1510
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,950
trying to get into security or you need

1511
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:55,410
help use this hashtag there's also ask

1512
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:58,109
InfoSec if you just have a specific

1513
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,700
one-off question I'm but I retweet this

1514
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,560
all the time there's a whole bunch of us

1515
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,109
that answer questions about this each

1516
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:08,430
week so please come join us on Monday

1517

but yeah I share a lots of stuff and do

1527
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,350
lots of stuff like this because it's

1528
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:37,950
really important to me that we further

1529
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:40,170
the cause so what did we learn today we

1530
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,759
learned about purple team we learned do

1531
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:44,370
we have to collaborate if we want to be

1532
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,580
good at apps heck and we learned modern

1533
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:49,500
tools and practices for the win with

1534
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,779
that I would like to thank you for your

1535
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:54,570
time and attention today thank you very

1536
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,550
much if you want to see my slides that

1537
01:03:54,570 --> 01:04:00,030
link at the top the bitly link it's not

1538
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:06,230
a hack it's actually my slides are there

1539
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:09,840
any questions all right I see some oh

1540
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:11,550
there's a job section see them in there

1541
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,370
I do have the questions all queued up

1542
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:15,030
all ready to go Oh perfect yeah I can't

1543
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,470
see them

1544
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,970
okay no problem a lot of them were

1545
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,439
filtered in through the destroyer

1546
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,029
Channel we had going at the same time a

1547
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,530
lot of good conversations going on

1548
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:24,990
around your talk so that was great to

1549
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,550
see as well so

1550
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:29,098
the first question that came in was

1551
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,500
around code do you have any preference

1552
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:33,390
between having code signed as part of

1553
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,580
the build pipeline versus a tool that

1554
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:42,270
constantly monitors get for changes and

1555
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:44,490
scans so I've never used code signing at

1556
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:46,560
any of the places I've worked but not

1557
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,118
because they did a great job of security

1558
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:51,810
but because we were not that organized

1559
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,849
before I switch to security I think that

1560
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:56,549
monitoring gets really important I think

1561
01:04:53,849 --> 01:05:00,330
you could also sign your code I think

1562
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:02,310
like you should be no one should be able

1563
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:06,240
to be changing or checking anything and

1564
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:07,740
to get that isn't an approved person so

1565
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,979
that would like be disconcerting if you

1566
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:12,118
have other people changing your code I

1567
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,560
guess I'm saying I don't have a firm

1568
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:15,900
opinion because I haven't had a chance

1569
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:18,060
to use code signing and see what its

1570
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:21,119
value proposition is based on that

1571
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:23,160
person's protecting github instead fair

1572
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,070
enough all right when we move on to

1573
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:29,098
containers Japanese recommended

1574
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:31,170
resources for learning about container

1575
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:33,240
security or even just containers in

1576
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,849
general what people hear about them a

1577
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,799
lot of people think they know they do a

1578
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:40,920
lot of people think they do and have no

1579
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,880
idea actually what they do so on Twitter

1580
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:45,359
I follow

1581
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:48,570
Ian cold water Ian's really awesome and

1582
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:51,270
knows a lot and shares a lot I'm also

1583
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:54,240
I'm part of the wasp dev slope project

1584
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:56,520
sloppy DevOps and we're an education

1585
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,669
project we also build stuff too and

1586
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:01,560
basically we're for nerds who just like

1587
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:04,530
to build and break things together and

1588
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:08,430
so we've had several different videos

1589
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:11,010
about kubernetes about containers about

1590
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:12,540
how to secure them we have like a bunch

1591
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,940
of good content where basically we

1592
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:17,520
interviewed and then got demos from like

1593
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,020
a lot of famous people so whenever I

1594
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,200
really want to learn something like I

1595
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:24,060
show and then they keychain for free um

1596
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,069
so I would definitely check out the dev

1597
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,320
swap YouTube channel and then look up

1598
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,849
look up containers because I'm sure we

1599
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,260
have at least two or three shows on it

1600
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:34,200
I'm pretty sure we have two or three

1601
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,089
about kubernetes as well at least and

1602
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,430
then we have a bunch of stuff about like

1603
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:40,589
yeah setting them up in a drivers

1604
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:43,078
I'm up in AWS I think we even have one

1605
01:06:40,589 --> 01:06:45,089
rjcp like we have a lot of episodes now

1606
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:46,890
where we go in deep and it's like a

1607
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:49,710
really good introduction for each of

1608
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,660
them awesome

1609
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:54,930
sticking with containers with them going

1610
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:57,930
up and down so fast can you how can you

1611
01:06:54,930 --> 01:07:01,399
keep an inventory management on it or

1612
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:04,859
detect if malicious one slip in a note

1613
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,990
and so I think they're talking about

1614
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:10,319
service is that what they're talking

1615
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:14,669
about or containers what's mentioning

1616
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:16,349
containers containers okay so if

1617
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:18,359
someone's bring other containers into

1618
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:20,280
your system the aren't supposed to be

1619
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:21,808
there that's disconcerting if they're

1620
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,579
bringing them up and down without your

1621
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:26,760
knowledge that's disconcerting I'm

1622
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:29,700
wondering um if they're talking about

1623
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,740
them disappearing a lot if maybe they

1624
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,359
meant circle is cuz serverless kind of

1625
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,569
turns off and on like usually containers

1626
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,980
are on most the time because it's

1627
01:07:36,569 --> 01:07:40,410
running your web app or it's running

1628
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:43,829
your API like all the time that makes

1629
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:46,529
sense yep totally but you should be

1630
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:48,210
logging them and there are systems that

1631
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,980
can help you organize them like service

1632
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:53,760
mesh like to make sure that they're not

1633
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,290
disappearing on you yeah I feel like I'm

1634
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,880
a bit confused with the question I hope

1635
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,410
that my information was helpful whoever

1636
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,210
asked that if you want to like kind of

1637
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:04,799
clarify a bit and the chat I would be

1638
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:09,690
helpful excellent and with DevOps

1639
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:12,470
pipeline where do they live in the

1640
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:17,580
software development life cycle and what

1641
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:21,299
gateway sorry miss reading him and what

1642
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:25,170
gateway do they enter graciously is as

1643
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:27,929
it's written okay so when I say a devops

1644
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:29,250
pipeline I mean a CI CD pipeline so

1645
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:31,890
continuous integration continuous

1646
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:36,870
delivery and potentially continuous

1647
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:38,429
deployment so basically we used to we

1648
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:40,979
used to publish our code by like right

1649
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:46,140
clicking and pressing publish or by

1650
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:48,750
manually copying like files onto iis or

1651
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,310
like onto the web server or whatever and

1652
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,140
then we started coming up with like

1653
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,550
systems to do it for us

1654
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:56,010
and then eventually someone came up with

1655
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:58,830
the idea of well what if we have a

1656
01:08:56,010 --> 01:09:01,770
system that automates that process and

1657
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:04,830
so then they said well what if we have

1658
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,960
it so it you know integrates the code

1659
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:08,430
with the other code so if you have you

1660
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,960
know ten people all working on the same

1661
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:11,400
thing and you know I'm working all day

1662
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,350
you're working all day we need to merge

1663
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:15,540
our code and make sure that works we

1664
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:17,820
used to do that in the code repository

1665
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,439
and it's kind of messy and janky and we

1666
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:22,139
wouldn't run it to see if it worked

1667
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,750
but a CI CD what it does is like it

1668
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,030
merges it but then it also like runs a

1669
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:29,580
bunch of automated tests that you design

1670
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:31,500
to see if it actually worked and it will

1671
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:33,510
put it on to a test web server so you

1672
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,580
can see oh like it's actually running it

1673
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:36,780
does compile a sanity check checked but

1674
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,850
what we want to make sure more things

1675
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:40,710
run and so then both of us can keep

1676
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:42,330
checking things in all the time and it

1677
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,700
continues to integrate it and make sure

1678
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:48,330
the pieces all work together and you can

1679
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:49,529
add security tests in there and not too

1680
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:51,510
many because you don't want to make it

1681
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:53,189
really slow and piss everyone off but it

1682
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:55,140
is a great way for you to be able to

1683
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,849
automate a bunch of your security tests

1684
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:58,920
that are the most important to you for

1685
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:01,020
instance to make sure there's no secrets

1686
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,420
that got in there like a username and

1687
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:07,740
password combo you don't want that to be

1688
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:09,600
and your github repo perfect that looks

1689
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:12,780
like all the questions that we had come

1690
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,970
in one thank you very much for taking a

1691
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:17,450
time of your data kind of close out our

1692
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:21,630
conference here is greatly appreciated

1693
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:23,639
thank you thank you I really appreciate

1694
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:28,740
you having me and thank you so much I

1695
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:34,070
hope that I see you next year it's

1696
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:34,070
perfect thank you very much you bye bye
