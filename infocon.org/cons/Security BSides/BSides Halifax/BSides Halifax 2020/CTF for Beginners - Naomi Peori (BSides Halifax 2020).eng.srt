beginners

27

I guess I'm starting a minute leave or a

28
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,100
minute early so anyway no worries my

29
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,840
name is Naomi I work as a senior

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,150
software developer at go secure I'm

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,970
affiliated with what SEK Halifax in DC

32
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,459
902 if you have any questions after the

33
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,549
talk the slides will be provided for

34
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,989
free shortly afterwards feel free to

35
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:47,150
contact me on these places here

36
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,470
especially on Twitter I'm almost to a

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,230
thousand followers and if I hit a

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,150
thousand I get ice cream as a treat so

39
00:02:51,230 --> 00:03:02,530
be really cool if if people could follow

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:05,060
there all right so why compete in CTF

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,530
it's a great way to learn new skills the

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,549
kind of skills you don't get to use

43
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,739
often you don't get to hack things for

44
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,650
fun very often and without getting into

45
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:20,000
trouble I'm not a lawyer but I know you

46
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:23,019
probably shouldn't do it it's a bad idea

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,019
hold on one second

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,358
yeah so you learn new skills kind of

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,709
skills you don't get to use often you

50
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,629
keep the skills you do have sharp with

51
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,030
real practice again you don't get to do

52
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,100
this in real life very often you get to

53
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,410
better understand the mechanisms behind

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,620
everyday computing you can meet people

55
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,450
like us with similar interests and you

56
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,130
get a sense of pride and bragging rights

57
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,700
when you do some cool stuff

58
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,430
people love CTF so they think hey you

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,170
know if you can do this you're a really

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:01,390
cool person and that's that's kind of

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:05,179
the best part so tips for a good time

62
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,359
remember this is a game don't feel

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,370
intimidated don't feel you have to do

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,420
the very best to really get anything out

65
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,620
of this it's just a game it's fun it's

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,880
not like the real world all the

67
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,380
challenges are meant to be solved in the

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,330
real world if you're if you're going

69
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,980
it's a target you don't know if there's

70
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,960
a flaw or not but in a game like this

71
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,070
there's always one it's there's always

72
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,799
one waiting to be found

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,820
so your effort is never fruitless

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,650
there's points to be scored for

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:45,620
everything you do so don't be afraid to

76
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:48,799
try excuse me

77
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,920
be thorough because there's a ton of

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,930
ways to get scores in these games even

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,960
the simplest things you think you know

80
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,690
it's too simple maybe not bother no just

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:05,599
try you know and try to have some fun

82
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:08,210
it's uh it's a lot of fun alright so

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
some useful software to get to get

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,299
started here I like to use a target

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,020
called a juice shop it's from Ross it's

86
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,520
a sample website that lets you that has

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,370
all these flaws kind of built in and

88
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,990
lets you kind of practice your

89
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:30,590
techniques your tools your your

90
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,450
everything let's show to you here there

91
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,780
is this is what it looks like it's it's

92
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:40,170
a storefront you can buy products you

93
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,950
can trust me on it's it's pretty cool

94
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,570
[Music]

95
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,450
it's easy to download and it runs in

96
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,680
docker so you can run on pretty much

97
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,479
everything

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,870
it completely resets everything I need

99
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,000
start out

100
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,100
so if you mess something up you just

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,390
restart it and it starts fresh again so

102
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,430
there's no need to worry about databases

103
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,140
or anything like that it remembers your

104
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,100
progress with cookies even if you reset

105
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:06,020
it your progress is still saved so you

106
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,060
don't lose any progress it has a

107
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,240
scoreboard in the scoreboard if you can

108
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,490
find it has some hints and the website

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,770
has everything documented with solutions

110
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,450
so you can find out where you went wrong

111
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,460
or what things you're missing it's it's

112
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,530
really a good learning project so here's

113
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,370
how to install it be basically do docker

114
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,830
pull and a docker run you don't know

115
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,330
these docker just download it and then

116
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,550
you can use those on the command line

117
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:39,140
and then you access it in your browser

118
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:45,200
on port 3000 because of this 3000 right

119
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:48,020
there now tools like operating systems

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,849
Kali Linux is a favorite for a lot of

121
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,010
people it's a version of Linux that has

122
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,690
all the fun tools pre-installed it has

123
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:58,400
some nice word lists it pretty much has

124
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,719
everything you need in one place any

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,609
Linux will do though

126
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,990
you know I I'd like to use a pun to

127
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,880
myself also Apple's Mac OS is is great

128
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,700
if you use something called homebrew at

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,800
that URL it gives you a command line

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,310
package manager much like you'd see in

131
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,590
Linux that you can do a brew get you

132
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,940
know whatever tools you need and I just

133
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,690
like to steal a word list from Callie

134
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,090
because you know they're pretty good

135
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,430
Windows I don't usually use it but I'm

136
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:33,619
sure you can you'd have to ask someone

137
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,420
else about that so one of my favorite

138
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,520
tools is the chrome developer tools in

139
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,780
the chrome web browser and it lets you

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,240
see things like the the source code the

141
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,510
JavaScript you can see a console and

142
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,660
execute you can modify stuff as you're

143
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,520
viewing it so it's good for

144
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,690
circumventing I say if there's a bit of

145
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,940
JavaScript preventing you from doing

146
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,770
something it also lets you edit cookies

147
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,440
and that kind of stuff and it's built

148
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,729
right into the browser and it's it's

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,800
very useful a plugin I like to use

150
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:10,699
is called forum editor and it lets you

151
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,039
quickly change values in a forum before

152
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,650
submitting it and it's useful because it

153
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,800
lets you see any hidden fields it lets

154
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,659
you add fields that lets you say if you

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,150
need to use a field and it's saying you

156
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:25,550
can only put in a number you can put in

157
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,188
text you can put in whatever you want

158
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,559
there's no limits in the form editor and

159
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,479
then you just click Submit and it sends

160
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:35,269
it off as if you've done it in the web

161
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,260
page but it lets you do more

162
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:42,709
fine-grained control of course burp

163
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,510
suite is it's a collection of tools used

164
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:46,880
by by pen testers and security

165
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,550
researchers it's got a lot of stuff to

166
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,769
it I'll admit I don't know most of it

167
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,819
but the thing that's most useful for me

168
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:58,490
is the it can be used as a proxy server

169
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,110
that lets you edit intercept and edit

170
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,760
the requests before they reach the

171
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,180
website so if there's something that the

172
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:10,610
form editor can't do like like a like a

173
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:13,989
you know like a job require JavaScript

174
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,510
request you can use a burp suite to

175
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:22,100
change that and I'll show you more about

176
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:26,269
that later one example and Foxy proxy

177
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:29,000
lets us selectively use burp suite as a

178
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,829
proxy it can if you look here at down

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,480
the juice box you can tell it that only

180
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,949
to intercept stuff going to the juice

181
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,420
box so if you're using Google to help

182
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,859
lookup stuff you're not worried about

183
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,899
intercepting your Google searches you

184
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,910
don't worry about other searches it will

185
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,430
let you just do the proxy just for the

186
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,500
site that you're you're concerned with

187
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:50,779
[Music]

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:54,440
all right so let's begin you're all

189
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:57,920
discovery is basically not everything on

190
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,149
the website is listed publicly this is a

191
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,599
way to discover resources that were not

192
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:05,240
meant to be publicly accessible things

193
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,319
like a minute or faces or files to

194
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,810
download you know basically things

195
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:13,969
hidden in plain sight if you know where

196
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,619
to look so the first thing we do is we

197
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,810
use something called n map and it's a

198
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,560
it's a network mapper it will let you

199
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,719
scan

200
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,699
a host it will try each Porsche

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,410
automatically for you and report whether

202
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,110
they're up and what kind of port they

203
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,939
are so your ordinality web server web

204
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,130
server is running on port 80 it might

205
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,930
find another web server on port like

206
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,210
8080 and it ends up being in a minute or

207
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,609
face so it lets you know what is

208
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,380
actually running on that server I don't

209
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,510
recommend running this on machines you

210
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,880
don't have permission to run on because

211
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,240
it is a bit provocative you might get in

212
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,790
trouble here's an example of scanning a

213
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,900
host that's my local piehole

214
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:57,709
it's a DNS ad blocker you can see has an

215
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:00,230
SSH port open the DNS support our DNS

216
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,750
port on port 53 and a web server on port

217
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,870
80 there might be more or less depending

218
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,670
on where you're scanning but it doesn't

219
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,440
hurt to look it takes like under a

220
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,459
minute point one four seconds nice

221
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,380
another quick thing to check is the

222
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,270
robots.txt file and this is a file

223
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:22,490
that's designed to tell a place of

224
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,829
Google and other search engines not to

225
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,650
index these files and usually it's more

226
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,710
like these are sensitive things so they

227
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,600
don't want it up on a search engine but

228
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,600
you know we can certainly take a look

229
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,300
inside and find things that they think

230
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,490
are sensitive is specifically on juice

231
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,310
box if you go to the robots.txt

232
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,640
that's right off the main route you'll

233
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,930
see it saying disallow slash FTP now if

234
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,250
we check that out in a browser we can

235
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,829
see that there are files and stuff

236
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,990
listed there it's basically it's like

237
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,390
free real estate you know it's it's

238
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,880
unprotected it's just lying in the open

239
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,750
and it's a real easy low-hanging fruit

240
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,820
to try now if we want to get a little

241
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,709
more thorough we can use a tool and this

242
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,450
one's called go Buster and what it does

243
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:13,670
is it root forces trying different URLs

244
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,970
we use a word list which is just a text

245
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,469
file filled with a bunch of words and

246
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,990
just tries them one after another after

247
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,730
another after another and then lets us

248
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,540
know if it found something there and

249
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:29,600
this can be another quick way to kind of

250
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,530
much like nmap just blast a site so

251
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,360
don't use it on sites you're not

252
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,589
supposed to but you blast the site

253
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,709
and see what what's there now we're

254
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,339
gonna do an example here typically to

255
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,869
start you go go Buster and you want to

256
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,779
do a directory listing you give it the

257
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,410
word list and the URL now if we were to

258
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,029
do that on juice box it doesn't work

259
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,790
right away and that's because most

260
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,990
websites when you go to a page that

261
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,490
doesn't exist it returns something

262
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,170
called a 404 page and that's a way of

263
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,000
saying hey this page doesn't exist and

264
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,199
and it might put up a little page that

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,720
says hey this page doesn't exist

266
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,459
unfortunately juice box returns a page

267
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,910
that says it doesn't exist but it

268
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:16,040
returns 200 which means it's a valid

269
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,160
page and the first thing go Buster says

270
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,459
is hey you know it's giving us wild card

271
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,310
responses of type 200 so there's a wild

272
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:28,069
card switch we can use so we turn on

273
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,930
wild card mode and we also turn on

274
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,660
include length so when we can try it

275
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:35,149
we'll see what the size of that wild

276
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,089
card response is and then we can use

277
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,640
grep to filter that out so we only get

278
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:44,839
the responses where we're we're

279
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,399
interested in here's here's what that

280
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,510
looks like on juice box after you've

281
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:54,410
filtered out the responses as you can

282
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,360
see it found a few place a few different

283
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:00,290
URLs and if I go to one like slash

284
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,110
promotion this is what we'll see it's

285
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:06,079
not very exciting but it is something

286
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:11,089
we're not supposed to look at I'm gonna

287
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:15,739
show what it looks like just seeing see

288
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:17,269
it in action here so it starts up it's

289
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,399
trying different sites and you see it it

290
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:21,920
takes a bit of time it's a rather large

291
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,899
list but it's kind of even far off and

292
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,870
just leave while you try other stuff on

293
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:30,050
the site and it'll turn through the

294
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,329
entire word list you know give it 5 or

295
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:37,430
10 minutes and you'll find most of the

296
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:39,670
other sites you'd be interested in keep

297
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:44,029
it in Twitter dings

298
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,089
alright so parameter tampering now that

299
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,560
we've discovered a bunch of things to

300
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:52,390
access well let's start doing stuff with

301
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,010
that parameter tampering is basically

302
00:14:52,390 --> 00:15:00,019
modifying the data before it reaches the

303
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:03,649
server we can manipulate cookies hidden

304
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,820
form fields URL query strings anything

305
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:06,980
where there's a value or setting of the

306
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,130
server we want to send in something it

307
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,019
doesn't expect again don't overthink it

308
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,790
try everything like there's so many

309
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,519
simple things people don't think to try

310
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,670
and those are worth points just try it

311
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,860
it's it's everyone skips a simple stuff

312
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,079
and then they regret it later

313
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,720
put in unexpected invalid random values

314
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,880
to large values negative values empty

315
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,130
values put a whole paragraph in there

316
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,920
where it leads just one word just try to

317
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,269
break it that's really the goal here

318
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,709
click on things you shouldn't do stuff

319
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,670
out of order just really be a bad user

320
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:46,250
it's essentially what Quality Assurance

321
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:49,520
is and it works one things first things

322
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,230
I look for is hidden functionality if

323
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,329
there's some things left over from early

324
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,399
development or maybe something that's

325
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:58,069
disabled that will get enable later on

326
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,959
but for now is disabled they're really

327
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,700
easy to find you look in the source and

328
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,819
you look for things like the disable tag

329
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,130
or a display:none style so it's hidden

330
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:12,529
but it's still enabled and we can use

331
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:13,870
the developer tools to do this so here's

332
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,850
an example here we're going to try

333
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,170
buying things with an empty wallet so

334
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,120
during the checkout we're going to go

335
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,829
into developer tools we're going to

336
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,060
right click on the pay using wallet

337
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:24,859
button and I'll show you this in a

338
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,989
second we're going to remove this

339
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,699
disable equals truth tag on the element

340
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,449
and then we're going to click on the now

341
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,880
enabled pay using wallet button so we're

342
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:39,069
here at our website and we are logged in

343
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,070
so I add a few things to the basket

344
00:16:43,640 --> 00:17:07,459
oh this is great one lie behind things

345
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:09,860
basket okay so we're login this is a an

346
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,559
account I made earlier good stuff the

347
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:15,678
basket area alright to add something the

348
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:24,829
basket we're gonna go check it I'm gonna

349
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:32,559
add new address I should set this up

350
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:35,178
earlier address one day delivery why not

351
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,678
all right so here's our paid using

352
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,270
wallet button and it's currently

353
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,590
disabled I can't click on or I click on

354
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,840
it nothing happens so I'm going to right

355
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:47,659
click I'm going to go to inspect and

356
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,659
here we see here's the button here and

357
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,870
we can see can you see that good

358
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,340
it says disabled equals true so I double

359
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,699
click on that I'm just going to

360
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,360
backspace it out and I'm gonna hit enter

361
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,990
and close the dev tools and you see it's

362
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,870
now enabled so we click on that we place

363
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,860
your order and we just bought an item on

364
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:15,199
a wallet that was empty so if we look at

365
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,330
our wallet now its balance is now

366
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,070
negative or dollar eighty eight's we've

367
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:25,960
done a negative purchase we've basically

368
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:29,090
stolen an item from the site oops

369
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,770
alright so our next thing is to do some

370
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,280
session tampering we're going to try to

371
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,389
charge a purchase to someone else's card

372
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,370
again during checkout we're going to go

373
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,660
to the developer tools we're gonna click

374
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,850
on the application tab and we're going

375
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,410
to go to the session storage on the

376
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,418
sidebar and we're going to edit the

377
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:54,659
payment ID to another ID so back to our

378
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:57,599
site that's fine egg fruit juice okay

379
00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:01,769
so go check it let's end it here let's

380
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,840
do standard Calibri this time and we're

381
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:04,679
gonna I got no money again alright so

382
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I'm gonna do this again

383
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:20,549
I should put credit card in all right so

384
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,408
okay we're gonna go back in the

385
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:28,979
developer tools we're going to go to the

386
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:33,720
application session storage and here we

387
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:35,639
see here's the current transaction it

388
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,119
stores it and cookies so it persists

389
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:40,830
between pages right all we do is double

390
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,139
click here and we can change a different

391
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,299
address week and ever change it from

392
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:52,590
payment ID which one there you know go

393
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:57,389
to pin ID six and there we go

394
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:59,639
place the order and doesn't really show

395
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:06,508
but if we go to the wallet I guess we

396
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:07,580
can see our wall in the house balance in

397
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,869
it that's weird

398
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,239
alright so this isn't according to plan

399
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,330
but you'll know on the CTF if there's a

400
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,139
much better job of putting up a

401
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:22,080
notification when you've done something

402
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:25,258
like scores points all right we'll just

403
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,009
move along URL parameters I don't have a

404
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:30,779
great example this on the juice box but

405
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:33,239
there are some examples of it on the CTF

406
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:37,859
today and the URL parameter is just the

407
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:40,769
thing you see on the the URL of the of

408
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:44,789
the site in here like the search box it

409
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:47,149
sends the query as a URL parameter on

410
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,320
the address but all you do is you just

411
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:51,658
change it you hit enter and send it and

412
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,950
it will submit with that new address and

413
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:56,729
the idea is to use it to again send

414
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,489
values

415
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:01,470
it doesn't expect like if you see say it

416
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:03,239
has an identification number and it's

417
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,070
your ID number well what happens if you

418
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:07,289
change that ID number to something else

419
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,399
and hit enter often you can see someone

420
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:12,360
else's information

421
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,720
or submit data as someone else it's

422
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,879
really easy to do and I highly recommend

423
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,870
looking like when you see it just try a

424
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,470
bunch of stuff we can see here on the

425
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,830
search you can see it's up in here and

426
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:32,430
we can just change that to whatever a

427
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:36,360
and we see things with a in it yeah not

428
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:38,490
for exciting HTML form parameters again

429
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,928
with juice box is not a great example of

430
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:44,640
things you can do so here's the reddit

431
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,700
login page and as you can see there are

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,590
a lot of variables there a lot of

433
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,059
parameters that are hidden you don't see

434
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,919
them on the page but they're sent with

435
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,190
the form and you can freely edit them

436
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,840
you can you can have the minus to

437
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,030
subtract them you can get plus to add

438
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,059
them again it's a really easy way to

439
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:06,600
kind of see what you can do and change a

440
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:09,809
few things so let's get in the burp

441
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,340
suite here HTML request parameters using

442
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,830
burp suite and foxy proxy we can

443
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,240
intercept and change any value inside an

444
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,669
HTML request so this example here is

445
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,400
adding things to our basket it sends a

446
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,050
product ID a basket ID and the quantity

447
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,610
now what would happen if we were to

448
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:31,440
change the value and buy a negative

449
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:34,850
quantity of an item as you can see you

450
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,410
can buy negative without a million and

451
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,740
you'll get money back basically and

452
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:44,790
that's that's really easy I'm going to

453
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,890
show it here this is burp suite and this

454
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,170
is the proxy part I'm going to turn the

455
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,960
interception on and I'm going to add

456
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,000
something to the basket you can see here

457
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,590
it does a command and that one is just

458
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,620
requesting the basket so we'll forward

459
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,080
that one and see here at the adding to

460
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,479
the basket with the product ID and stuff

461
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,199
and so we can add again negative a

462
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,240
million and we just hits forward and

463
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,880
forward we can turn those off so it just

464
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,900
completes it all and if we look here the

465
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,780
basket has our negative items in there

466
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,930
and we can check it out

467
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,930
[Music]

468
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:28,480
that's paid to the wallet success we

469
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,689
solved the challenge payback time place

470
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,809
an order that makes you rich so again

471
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:40,960
we'll go look at our wallet and oh we

472
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:44,379
got a ton of money now that's cool all

473
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,100
right so cross-site scripting is a is a

474
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,360
fun trick the type of injection in which

475
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,270
malicious scripts are injected into

476
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,469
otherwise benign and trusted websites

477
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:56,260
basically you can get other computers to

478
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,580
run your code when they view it so the

479
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:02,410
idea is that I want to put this XSS code

480
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,120
into something someone else is going to

481
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,860
view so when they view it it runs my

482
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,629
code there are limits as to what the

483
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,120
code can do it runs inside the browser

484
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,830
sandbox it's not like we're not supposed

485
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,479
to click on links in an email because

486
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,330
you download a virus you won't get a

487
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,730
virus from an XSS s attack but what it

488
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,040
can do is it can read your local browser

489
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,110
information like cookies and send them

490
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,240
to an external server and that's not

491
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,309
good it could do some things like your

492
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,929
session cookie so when you're logged

493
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:33,190
into Facebook the cookie that says

494
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,420
you're logged into Facebook could be

495
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,280
stolen

496
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,320
I don't like Facebook actually works

497
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,309
that way I don't know but that kind of

498
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,570
attack can happen in terms of CTF we

499
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:44,830
don't want to have to worry about all

500
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,720
that so what we're gonna do is we're

501
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,030
going to use a JavaScript that just pops

502
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,679
up an alert window you can make it say

503
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,070
whatever you want I just make it say XSS

504
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,600
and you put this thing everywhere you

505
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,760
put it in your name you put it in your

506
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,050
comments you put it anywhere we get some

507
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,879
text is going to be displayed for

508
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,550
another user you put it in there and

509
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,980
it's off from a scoring opportunity URL

510
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:08,678
parameters are also often a great way to

511
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,290
do that you just put it in just like

512
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,390
your L parameter and like sometimes a

513
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,920
website when something goes wrong it

514
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,500
puts up like a red box with an error

515
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,980
message and that red box has text that

516
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,720
comes in through a URL parameter you put

517
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,760
the JavaScript in there and you'll have

518
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,030
the pop-up on your own screen and for a

519
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,600
CTF that often gets you a score as well

520
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:32,940
[Music]

521
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,658
so here's what it looks like the little

522
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:49,980
pop-up

523
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:51,690
I don't think juice box has a great yeah

524
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,519
no it doesn't do a pop-up on the search

525
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:56,820
but even though I have a great example

526
00:25:53,519 --> 00:26:03,059
for in juice box the CTF today does have

527
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:04,889
opportunities for now to the tough one

528
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:10,200
the SQL injection this is where it gets

529
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:12,059
a little more technical SQL is a

530
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,080
structured query language and it's used

531
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:17,158
to talk to databases it's it's very it's

532
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
like a natural language like you can

533
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,330
understand that by reading it it's meant

534
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,659
for humans more than databases and an

535
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,850
SQL injection is where you put a piece

536
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,500
of your own SQL statement inside an

537
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:36,570
existing one and kind of subvert that

538
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:40,289
command to do something else so here's

539
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,519
some example SQL queries just to kind of

540
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,759
get you started

541
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,399
insert into users it puts a new value

542
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:51,539
into a database if you want to read a

543
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:53,879
database value a select will select data

544
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:56,370
out of the database an update lets you

545
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:59,189
change values and delete lets you of

546
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,250
course delete entries as feeling a very

547
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,559
complex but for most part at least

548
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,870
especially in CTFs it's pretty simple so

549
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:12,200
those ones there are the kind we'll run

550
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:15,059
into so let's run in an injection here

551
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,039
here's a typical login screen and behind

552
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,740
the scenes the code might look similar

553
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,779
to this select user ID from users where

554
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,730
username equals the value of the

555
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,379
username with ventur'd and password

556
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,379
equals the value of the password we've

557
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:30,719
entered in this case would be select

558
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:35,428
user ID from users where username equals

559
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,130
admin and password equals secret but

560
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,310
what happens if

561
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,840
unexpected values like a single quote so

562
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,730
if you're putting a single quote the

563
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,060
username is going to be single quote in

564
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,980
quotes and a password and that will give

565
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,260
us an error because an extra quote

566
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,870
characters made the query invalid and

567
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,540
that's often how you find potential

568
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,580
injections you just try a quote you try

569
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,990
to break what's there and it it doesn't

570
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,080
always return an error but the ones that

571
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:06,670
do you're golden now I'm gonna show you

572
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,830
here what that looks like so we go to

573
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:12,850
the login page and we'll try that single

574
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:16,659
quote and whatever for a password there

575
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,879
you go we see the big error and errors

576
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:23,320
can look different but that's what this

577
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,000
one looks like so let's try simple

578
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,250
injection so I'm just going to cut and

579
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,800
paste this in and this is a pretty

580
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,520
standard first one and I'll explain why

581
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,610
it works in a moment so quote or one

582
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,950
equals one - - and again as you can be

583
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:50,889
whatever and oh look we've logged in as

584
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:54,490
admin just that simple there we are

585
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:57,910
the indeed men it's that easy

586
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:00,460
so how does this work okay after

587
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,520
injection the query is now select user

588
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,720
ID from users where username equals

589
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,150
quote or one equals one

590
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,140
- - quote and password equals password

591
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:13,420
so the - - means ignore the end of the

592
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,940
query it's a comment so basically the

593
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,650
rest of the line gets chopped off

594
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,140
sometimes it uses two hash tags instead

595
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,120
it depends on the kind of database so if

596
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,190
we cut off the rest of line our query

597
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,659
looks like this select user ID from

598
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:31,930
users where username equals blank or one

599
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,490
equals one now one always equals one so

600
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,770
the username part is redundant so we can

601
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,320
just drop that as well so select user ID

602
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,580
from users where one equals one and the

603
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,340
database is going to go through each

604
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,740
line of the users table let's say okay

605
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,330
for this user does one equal one yeah so

606
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,370
puts that in the pilots this user

607
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,330
doesn't want equal one yeah so puts that

608
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,159
in the pile

609
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,010
and the query now returns a list of all

610
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,640
the users rather than just one or none

611
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:00,100
and most websites will assume that if it

612
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,470
gets a list the first one the user is

613
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:08,740
the one that's logging in and often this

614
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:11,020
is the administer this site so basically

615
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,950
we returned a list of all these --es and

616
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,230
to pick the first one to log us in as so

617
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,690
okay let's do something more interesting

618
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,150
let's try jumping some data now what I

619
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,500
look for is a page that will return a

620
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,210
list of values you know that login page

621
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,650
didn't return any data I just let us do

622
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:33,070
something we want to be able to see the

623
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:35,800
results of our of our data so usually a

624
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,659
search page is interesting right so if

625
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,490
we go to the search page and if we

626
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,870
intercept it in burp suite we'll see

627
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,520
that the search page is calling another

628
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:48,219
URL a URL that's a RESTful API call

629
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:56,889
called Product Search and a query now I

630
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:59,110
can show you that so let's for my

631
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:05,940
intercept on and I'm going to do the

632
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:05,939
search and we keep forwarding these

633
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:21,820
what's going on again I don't like burp

634
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:39,000
too much sometimes anyway what we should

635
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:40,439
be seeing somebody help me there we go

636
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,180
okay so I

637
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,280
zydeco and hit enter up there rather

638
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,790
than click in here because the way it

639
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,310
loads the page so we get that first get

640
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:54,570
we got a plank and here's our rest

641
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:57,330
product search Q equals blah right so if

642
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:03,649
we just take that and go to that

643
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:06,360
directly oh we got some intercept off

644
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:09,450
we're gonna get this response and that's

645
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,209
the raw data from the search now it's

646
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,280
kind of annoying to look at so we have a

647
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,560
pretty printer it's a JSON file format

648
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,480
so we just paste it in there we make it

649
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,250
pretty and you can see it's not all the

650
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,430
spacing and stuff for us it's the same

651
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,370
data and we can see here's the list of

652
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:29,190
the products right but one thing you'll

653
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:32,639
notice is that it goes from one twenty

654
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,230
four six thirty it's probably not giving

655
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,530
us all the data that's probably because

656
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,270
some of the data has been deleted but it

657
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:43,320
looks like it sets the deleted at field

658
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:47,780
rather than actually removed from the

659
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:50,669
database so you know we can do better so

660
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,590
let's try dumping all the products for

661
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,000
real now we can do another kind of

662
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:59,760
injection here we're going to try

663
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,790
putting that quote in it was very and

664
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,160
it's going to give us nothing right so

665
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,270
we'll put the quote and I'd add I'll

666
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,890
read this

667
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,600
we're gonna force the career to end

668
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,980
early with a dash dash so we can skip

669
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,040
whatever constraint was hiding their

670
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,970
products like a if it's doing a select

671
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,980
where deleted that doesn't equal nil we

672
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,190
can skip that so it'll show us those as

673
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:27,900
well and we have the two brackets

674
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:29,580
because we have to complete the the SQL

675
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,740
statement we've interrupted in the

676
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,929
middle of it I'll show you how we got to

677
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,690
those two quotes basically we just add

678
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,240
one other time until the error goes away

679
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,670
so if we start with the quote and then

680
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,950
the comment it's going to give us that

681
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:48,210
error because it's an incomplete input

682
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,110
so we're going to put a bracket it's

683
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,990
still incomplete

684
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,610
we're gonna put a second bracket and

685
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,110
then we finally get it and the

686
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,209
we're doing this blind we don't know

687
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:00,899
what the query actually looks like so we

688
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,429
want to try some things that just

689
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,429
generally work you kind of get a sense

690
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,860
for this eventually so we're going to

691
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:10,918
take all of this we're gonna put in our

692
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:16,649
pretty printer again and make it pretty

693
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:18,480
and now we see here like ID 10 and how

694
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,239
to delete it at we didn't have that

695
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,250
before so we're seeing all of the

696
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,560
entries in the table now instead of just

697
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,290
the ones they want us to see so we can

698
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,330
use that ID say go back to that add to

699
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,739
basket and we can put that ID in the

700
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,000
basket when you purchase items that is

701
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,158
supposed to be available for purchase

702
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,129
like having this information helps you

703
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:44,159
do other kinds of tampering so let's get

704
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:45,960
it let's do a little bit better now that

705
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,690
we have a way to get data get

706
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,710
information out of the database we want

707
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,340
to know more than just the products we

708
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,869
want to know everything so using the

709
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,149
previous error message we know that it's

710
00:34:54,869 --> 00:35:00,000
using SQLite for the database you can

711
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,940
see that in the screenshot here

712
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,380
SQLite error messages are often a great

713
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,440
way to get information about what's

714
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,760
running behind the scenes so we're going

715
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,070
to construct a query that allow us to

716
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,380
dump information from another table

717
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:17,000
specifically we want to dump information

718
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,560
from SQLite s' table of tables it has a

719
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,290
table that lists how a table was created

720
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,450
so we can see how the other ones are

721
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,640
formatted so how do we do that well

722
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,200
we're going to do the same kind of

723
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,540
insert but we're gonna make a little

724
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,129
more complex or use just a bunch of

725
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,720
letters to make sure no products get

726
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,330
matched so we don't have any products in

727
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,819
the output we don't need that the Union

728
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,650
call lets us concatenate to select

729
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,630
statements together so we can use Union

730
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,480
and our own select statement after it

731
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,490
and we know it's expecting nine fields

732
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,280
because if you look at the output here

733
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,799
it's got nine of these fields it the

734
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,900
page that displays the information is

735
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,090
expecting nine fields so we're going to

736
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,859
pad them out with just the number two

737
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,070
the number three and number four we're

738
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:07,160
just interested in the SQL field from

739
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:14,550
the SQLite master table right

740
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:17,220
if you put that in now I'm not running

741
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,930
it on local doctor I've got a machine

742
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,419
here that runs docker that's why I

743
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:25,350
changed that if we put that in we get a

744
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,780
different set of data edge all right so

745
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:32,670
if we go pretty print this again we'll

746
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,830
see we're getting how the table is

747
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,460
created we're getting we're pulling that

748
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,450
information up from another table

749
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,570
specifically that the addresses table

750
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:47,220
has full name has a mobile number or zip

751
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:54,380
code let's go for the users so we look

752
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:58,759
for a user's table it's down in the end

753
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:03,300
yeah the user's table has username

754
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:07,440
passwords emails you know good stuff to

755
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:09,150
know right so that's what the user's

756
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,640
table looks like when we extracted it

757
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,500
you just saw on the other screen so

758
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,390
armed with that we can start dumping

759
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,570
some user data we're gonna do a similar

760
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,430
injection again view Ras for the Union

761
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,550
select list I'm going to select the user

762
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:29,069
name email and password Pat it out to

763
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:30,750
nine from users same kind of injection

764
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,220
and we just incrementally as we learn

765
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,020
more about the database we can start

766
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,500
crafting these injections in a way that

767
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:43,430
pull more and more out of the database

768
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:50,180
so we're gonna give that a try and

769
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:53,450
there's our data let make it pretty and

770
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:56,850
now we have users we have emails

771
00:37:53,450 --> 00:38:00,029
passwords usernames now these passwords

772
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,370
are they're hashed they're encrypted so

773
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,890
we can't really do anything with that

774
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,020
password but sometimes you search it on

775
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:10,740
google maybe someone has already done it

776
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,890
oh what's G she already has it that's

777
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,140
cool anyway

778
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:19,220
so if we basically dumped the user table

779
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:25,558
we can dump other tables we can dump

780
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:27,839
whatever other kinds there were anyway

781
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,170
so that's how we don't be use a table

782
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,990
use a union select and basically put

783
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,359
information from another table in the

784
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,990
search results and you can do this on

785
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,058
anything that displays pages or

786
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,779
information from a table that has an

787
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:47,670
ejection it's a bit tedious to find the

788
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:49,680
stuff so we have tools for this this is

789
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,109
a tool called SQL map and it will

790
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,569
automate the detection detection and

791
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:57,839
exploit exploiting of SQL injection

792
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:59,250
flaws it's a it's one of my favorite

793
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,808
tools it's pretty nice we can use it

794
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:05,000
with URL parameters you give it the URL

795
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:07,049
and it's going to automatically detect

796
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,430
which ones are parameter so it's going

797
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,890
to say Q equals a well it's going to

798
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,348
start trying to put values into a to

799
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,940
kind of exploit it we can do with HTML

800
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:17,130
forms we'll give it the URL but we tell

801
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,799
it to do the forms on the page rather

802
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,059
than the parameter on the URL and it's

803
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:23,130
going to look in that form it's going to

804
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,079
grab the page look in the form it's

805
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,450
going to automatically see which values

806
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:32,730
are changeable and it's going to start

807
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:34,859
just hammering on all of them we can do

808
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,770
HTML request as well require a few extra

809
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:40,589
steps first we intercept a request in

810
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:42,480
burp suite we can right-click copy it to

811
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:44,940
a file and we can run SQL map on that

812
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,180
file and again it will automatically try

813
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,279
every parameter finds in the request if

814
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,379
it requires a session key when you're

815
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:53,760
logged in on a site that session key is

816
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,710
a stored in the request and it will use

817
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:02,130
that too it's a really nice tool to shop

818
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,299
isn't really exploitable with it so I

819
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,950
don't really have a great example to

820
00:40:03,299 --> 00:40:07,109
show but here's what it looks like in

821
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,180
general when you're running it just say

822
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:10,710
yes to everything and it'll do its own

823
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,348
thing and a lot of tech what kind of

824
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:15,599
database it is it'll detect as long as

825
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:22,390
it'll even tell you if a parameter is

826
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:24,010
XSS injectable as well so

827
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:28,509
some other stuff as we're winding down

828
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:33,369
here hashes are basically scrambling or

829
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:35,410
encoding data the idea is that like with

830
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:37,480
the password hash it's one-way and can't

831
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,098
be reversed so you can't even if you

832
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,670
dump the password you don't get the pass

833
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:45,059
or you just get the hash but you can

834
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:48,839
identify some of these and things like

835
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:51,130
base64 can be encoded and decoded and

836
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:54,660
you look for the equal sign at the end

837
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,660
I'm going to show you an example of that

838
00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:01,210
there's Google tools for all the sorts

839
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:03,190
of stuff so go base64 decode this one's

840
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,589
a cool one we just paste it there we

841
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:09,789
have to code and hello world you know

842
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:12,940
that one was reversible URL parameter is

843
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:16,480
often the encodes characters like spaces

844
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,490
and other normally unsafe characters

845
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,849
it'll put a percent into numbers so if

846
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:24,490
you see something with that it's a it's

847
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:25,869
your all encoded string and again this

848
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,879
there's things on Google that will

849
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:33,190
decode that for you and then we get to

850
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,900
md5 and sha-1 way hashes and you can

851
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,970
there are tools that you can use to

852
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,380
brute force a word list against that and

853
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:42,430
to kind of see being crack it that way

854
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:45,460
but often it's not worth the work in a

855
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:47,500
CTF you can often find that if you put

856
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,849
it in a Google search someone else is

857
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:54,880
already cracked it for you so encryption

858
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:56,079
is a way of scrambling data that can

859
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,150
only be to scrambled if you know the

860
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,880
secret again it's not worth generally

861
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,859
cracking in a CTF but the kind of

862
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,299
encryption you'll see in the CTF is fun

863
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:08,170
encryption methods they're simple

864
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:10,660
they're not they're not hard to break if

865
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:14,230
you know what you're looking at like

866
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:16,359
here the Caesar cipher based on there's

867
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:17,710
a website I like to use called decode FR

868
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,119
it's French but they have an English

869
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,119
version that /en and

870
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:34,430
[Music]

871
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,890
I'm so Caesar so so we just put in there

872
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:40,040
we got a test all possible shifts we

873
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,660
decrypt it it says hello world so

874
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,770
there's tools on Google to help you do

875
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:47,750
this stuff these are hard to tell

876
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,130
sometimes but you kind of say okay maybe

877
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,589
it's it's rot their team maybe the

878
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:54,050
Caesar maybe it'll give you suggested

879
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:57,070
ones on the slide these similar tools so

880
00:42:54,050 --> 00:43:01,730
it's usually not hard to find

881
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:04,040
and finally the burp suite keeps a map

882
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,250
of all the things you've gone to it logs

883
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,920
it for later use and you can use it to

884
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,260
when you're reheating a wall go back and

885
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,220
see things you've tried or or haven't

886
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:19,820
fully tried yet Wow 3s is an address

887
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:22,759
that's cool if you look here it's in the

888
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,440
target and you'll see it has this map of

889
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,570
various things and these are just the

890
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,520
different sites that it's they're

891
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:33,589
different to euros it's all go by and

892
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,150
you can see every every request that's

893
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:37,070
gone through to that specific thing and

894
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,700
you can like here's the time we add it

895
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:43,849
to the basket so it automatically keeps

896
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:50,000
a log of this you can go back and see

897
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:51,020
what what there is and that's it for

898
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,869
today

899
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,359
these should be enough to get you

900
00:43:52,869 --> 00:44:00,619
probably about half or more of the

901
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:03,589
challenges on the CTF and well good luck

902
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:06,020
a lot of fun I'll be hanging around

903
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:08,210
hanging on hanging out the CTF channel

904
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:10,580
throughout the day answering questions I

905
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,930
won't give you the answers but I hope

906
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:20,029
you find the answers if you know what I

907
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:20,810
mean so yeah any questions alright

908
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,840
perfect

909
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:26,600
that a couple quick questions that came

910
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,400
in guess one a pretty general one what

911
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,290
are some of the biggest mistakes that

912
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,460
people tend to try to make when they're

913
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:37,040
you know going through a CTF process

914
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,750
biggest mistakes probably the biggest

915
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,920
one I see is people not trying the

916
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:45,380
simple stuff things like for an SQL

917
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,590
injection you might find one in one

918
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,420
place and use that to dump everything

919
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,250
and there's another injection over here

920
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:56,360
you don't try because you already have

921
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:58,340
the data but it's worth points to so do

922
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,460
that one as well every time there's

923
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,720
there's an injection do every instance

924
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,150
of it every time there there's a

925
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,470
parameter tampering do every one of them

926
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:13,010
in a CTF every kind of every entry point

927
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:15,109
is a scoring opportunity and I find

928
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:18,040
people if they're really good at the

929
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:22,420
stuff they kind of forget to do that and

930
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,779
they end up losing out on points

931
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,740
excellent

932
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:31,280
have you ever used a dirt buster if so

933
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,959
do you feel go Buster is superior uh you

934
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,400
know they're basically the same thing I

935
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,540
think go Buster's just written and go

936
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,420
and they both do the same thing so fill

937
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,279
your boots either others good Hey and we

938
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,580
also have someone asking if you would be

939
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,960
willing to make the slides available

940
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,520
yeah they'll be up probably in a couple

941
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,040
minutes I'll paste it on the discord

942
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,050
okay perfect and that's also a good

943
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,509
reminder there's been lots of good chats

944
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,820
going on in the discord so you know be

945
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,620
sure to join in get involve talked with

946
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,800
different members of the community also

947
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:07,130
sign up for the CTF if you haven't

948
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,990
another question coming in gets just

949
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,030
some recommendations for some beginner

950
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:13,160
resources first time doing something is

951
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:16,550
there more information on these tools or

952
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,020
something like that the biggest one I

953
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,830
find the right is on theirs their own

954
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,840
site here they have these guides and

955
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:27,140
like this cheat sheet tells you various

956
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:29,710
things you might want to try different

957
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,720
kinds of attacks you might want to do

958
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:33,829
these these cyber ranges are designed to

959
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,218
be edge

960
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:41,150
so the information is often there for

961
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:44,690
you to try it like forceful browsing we

962
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,749
did that with the URL discovery SQL

963
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:50,809
injection in terms of like an online

964
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:52,609
source to learn this stuff juice box is

965
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,099
probably the best I've found so far if

966
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:58,910
only because it's documented the answers

967
00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:01,400
aren't there and it does it has the main

968
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:02,899
page has hints and then the other page

969
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,579
has the solution so even if you just

970
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,640
look at the hints to kind of give you a

971
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:09,739
bread breadcrumb trail to follow it can

972
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,538
be a good way to do it too there's other

973
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:13,940
sites online to try this out like hack

974
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:15,829
the box I'm sure there's a million of

975
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,539
them that's one of my favorites and they

976
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:20,749
basically have vulnerable systems you're

977
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:24,019
allowed to play with and forums to talk

978
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:25,430
to people about it perfect yeah and you

979
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,718

980
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,729
question that we had in here right now

981
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,339

982
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:33,859
