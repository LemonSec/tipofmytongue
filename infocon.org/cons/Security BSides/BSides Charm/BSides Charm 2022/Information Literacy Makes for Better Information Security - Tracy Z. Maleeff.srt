okay good afternoon and welcome i'm

2
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
tracy maylief

3
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,279
this i'm also known as infosec sherpa on

4
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
twitter in case you know me

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,200
this talk

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
information secure information literacy

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
makes for better information security

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,559
now if you turn to your hymnal page 23

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
uh you'll be able to read the american

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
library association's definition of

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
information literacy

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,120
so what i want to talk about today is i

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
just want to help

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
you all

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,039
with my library science background to be

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,039
better consumers and better

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
disseminators of information i'm going

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,360
to be using that that phrase a lot

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,119
because i want to burn it into your

20
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,360
brain okay

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,880
so a couple notes here

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,479
this is going to be very philly centric

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
talk sorry not sorry

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,320
we will have some opportunities along

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
the way i hope to give out prizes so i

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
have goldenberg's peanut shoes if you

27
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,439
know you know these are awesome

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,960
and um

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,479
yeah i just really want to give this

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,720
talk today because i i feel passionate

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
about this this topic you know again um

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
you probably already know

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
people are probably here sick of hearing

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
me saying it but i was a librarian for

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
15 years i have a master's degree of

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
library and information science so this

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,399
is something that i care very much about

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,000
and i also just wanted to share that

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
again in case people are like well who

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
does she think she is well i'm a

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
librarian dammit who

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,759
who now works in cyber security oh and

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
yes i am a security researcher for the

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
krebs thomas group and i actually

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
utilize a lot of my

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,799
information security and

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,719
library science skills there and i

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
worked in i don't know if i'm allowed to

49
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,160
call it a sock anymore after the last

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
sean's talk i'm not sure but i actually

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
had two sock experiences prior to this

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,040
so i do have technical experience along

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
with my library science and along with

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
the other work that i do now so that is

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
my street cred for you

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
all right let's first cover some ground

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,800
here what this talk isn't first it is

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
not a debate okay so i'm not going to be

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,720
taking any

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
questions from the audience unless i ask

61
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,519
you so speak when spoken to people okay

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
um

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
um and then what this also isn't is i'm

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
really not trying to make any political

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,760
commentary or make any statements or

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
anything

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
you may roll your eyes at some things

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
that i say but that's your problem not

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
mine i'm really just trying to share

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
good tactics and mindsets of how to

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
consume and give information

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
so what this talk is

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360
uh it's a guide to again i told you i'm

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
going to be repeating it um i should i

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,200
was going to make bingo cards for this

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
talk but i realized that was a little

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
bit too much extra even for me so um

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
again i want you to be better consumers

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,280
of information and better disseminators

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,440
of information that's all this talk is

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
so don't try to look in and think that

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
i'm pushing an agenda or anything i'm

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
just pushing common sense and then this

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
talk is also a nice place to sit for 30

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
minutes so if you really don't care what

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
i have to say just welcome you might get

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
a piece of candy out of it

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
all right so of course the obligatory uh

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
my thoughts and comments are mine my own

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
and not those of my employer nor are

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,519
they my thought the thoughts of any

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
organizations with which i am affiliated

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
that's a fancy way of saying if you

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
don't like something that i say in my

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
talk bring it up with me later

96
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
afterwards and the price to talk to me

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
about this is a gin and tonic so be

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
prepared

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,799
that is how i will engage with you

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,319
okay so what are we talking about here

101
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,239
so pick your poison information can be

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
poison right information can be helpful

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
and it can be hurtful so you got your

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,239
misinformation you got your

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,920
disinformation you got your mail

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,879
information so quick show of hands who's

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
heard of the term misinformation before

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
excellent all right who's heard of

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
disinformation

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
excellent how about mal information

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
less hands okay awesome um so i'm going

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
to explain what all of those are

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
so these are your standard

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
definitions of of that oh and the good

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
folks at sisa have now abbreviated this

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
to mdm because believe me if you try to

117
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
say misinformation disinformation mal

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
information three times fast it's

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
impossible and if you say it a lot you

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
jumble your words so from now on mdm is

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
this and that's not a club drug and it's

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
not anything can key so it's

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
misinformation disinformation mal

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
information

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
so what i'm going to do is so i'm not

126
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,960
going to read the slides you all can

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,199
read i presume if not please see me and

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,919
i'll get you help um

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,160
these are the definitions

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,520
you think you might understand but i'm

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
going to show you some examples of what

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
this really means

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,800
here's an example of misinformation

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
that

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
that i'm gritty chase breaking news

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
tracy is gritty she reveals it me

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,199
i wish that were true

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,520
but that's misinformation right that's

139
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,639
it's not real it's false

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
but it's also not necessarily harmful

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
right i could laugh this off like haha

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
yeah right i'm i'm gritty so that's just

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
that's an example of misinformation and

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
you know this could go a couple ways

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
right this could just be fun and not be

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
a big deal or it could go down a

147
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
slippery slope right and turn into

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
something more disastrous as we'll see

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,199
here

150
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,880
disinformation

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
tracy is gritty burns down the world

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,960
she's out of control save yourselves

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,880
breaking news

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
uh

155
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
how quickly did that get out of hand

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
right that escalated quickly

157
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
so yeah things can then be turned into

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,240
disinformation you may already be

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
familiar with the cut that meme of

160
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,360
gritty and the flames

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
you know what could that mean that could

162
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
mean something fun or that could mean

163
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,479
that i'm inside a gritty suit trying to

164
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,039
burn down the world that's just

165
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,960
disinformation that's harmful right

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
that's harmful to my reputation to my

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
well-being

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
and then we look at mal information

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
tracy's not gritty at all

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
she's really a basketball fan hates

171
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,400
gritty hates hockey hates you

172
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,199
so

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,039
let's talk about male information mal

174
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
information is based on fact but it's

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
used out of context

176
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,960
yes it is true i like the sixers i am a

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,479
basketball fan

178
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
but i still like hockey and i still like

179
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
gritty they're not mutually exclusive

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
but look how this true information that

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
seems innocuous can be turned around

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
into something bad so now what are they

183
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,759
trying to do someone is trying the cbc

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,080
sports is trying to turn all the gritty

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,479
lovers against me look how easy that

186
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,080
happened it went from ha ha oh my god

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,599
that's so funny too

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,639
whoa

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,440
tracy's is unhinged she's burning stuff

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
down and then oh my god that tracy she

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
hates gritty she hates us oh my god

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,840
you get it

193
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
misinformation disinformation mail

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
information it can get out of hand

195
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,479
really quickly

196
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
all right

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
so you're like okay great lady you like

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,639
sports big deal okay

199
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
so here are my talking points here so

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
information can help but it can also

201
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,560
hurt

202
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,319
so my wish for all of you is to leave

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
this talk as more savvy critical

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
thinking consumers of information and

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
responsible disseminators of information

206
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,879
now i know that there's a lot in our

207
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,879
community who take pride in pardon my

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
language posting um but kind of

209
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
like the ads for casinos you know the

210
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,240
you know when big jackpots gamble

211
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,759
responsibly um you know

212
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,520
you know fine i'm not telling you not to

213
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
 post but please post

214
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,360
responsibly you know that's really all

215
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
i'm asking

216
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
but to kind of turn this into more of of

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
our you know

218
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,240
milia here think of it as opsec you

219
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
wouldn't share true information that

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
could compromise someone or something

221
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,680
would you

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
don't share false or ambiguous

223
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
information that could also jeopardize

224
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,319
someone or something to me it's as

225
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
simple as that

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,120
if you're still having trouble

227
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
connecting the dots between information

228
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,559
literacy and information security let me

229
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
break it down this way

230
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
you don't want to be making important

231
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,279
security decisions on bad data or flawed

232
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,799
intelligence

233
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
that could mean in the heat of the

234
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,279
moment of incident response or a status

235
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,839
report that goes to upper management

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,680
once your decisions or reports leave

237
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
your hands you don't necessarily know

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
where that information goes and what

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,040
decisions it's being used to make

240
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
being information literate means that

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
you can confidently stand by your work

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
whether that information product is used

243
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
to make c-suite-level decisions or just

244
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,959
a playbook for your team

245
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
and that's why i'm so passionate about

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,279
this

247
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
information matters and information

248
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
illiteracy impacts all of us

249
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
so what are my tips on this i promise

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
some tools and tips

251
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
so we're going to practice some ice cube

252
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,720
sec

253
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
you're going to check yourself before

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,800
you wreck yourself okay i want everybody

255
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
to keep that in mind when you're reading

256
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
and disseminating information check

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
yourself before you wreck yourself if

258
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
you're not going to listen to ice cube

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
then a we can't be friends and b it's

260
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
just smart it's just absolutely smart

261
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,399
so what are some tips okay so first of

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,040
all provenance while this is a gorgeous

263
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
photo of france that's provence

264
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
provolone is a creamy italian cheese

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,720
that is delicious on a hoagie but i'm

266
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,959
talking about provenance

267
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,600
that means the origin of information

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
where is this information coming from so

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
i'll give you a good example

270
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
a lot of times a local news service tv

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
or newspaper

272
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
will republish an associated press or a

273
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
reuters wire story

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
i've seen this too many times where

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
the local news

276
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
is now editing

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
the the wire story they're leaving

278
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
things out they're adding things in

279
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
so you're really not getting the full

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
story anymore but you don't know that

281
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
because they're citing the attribution

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
of the ap wire so it's understandable

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
that you would take it oh okay they're

284
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,800
just copy and pasting the ap wire

285
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
not necessarily

286
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,079
if you look at them side by side so what

287
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,399
i want you to do if you're click on an

288
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
article if you're reading something and

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
you see that it's by whatever source

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
it's from and they they

291
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
tell you very clearly that it's a wire

292
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,200
article

293
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
stop

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
what you're doing

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
go just google the title of the article

296
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,279
or go to the associated press wire

297
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,320
website look at it from the source

298
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
that's what i ask is because that way

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
now again i i this is why there's some

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
slippery slopes here i'm not going to

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,120
say that

302
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,079
the information is is right as far as

303
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:16,959
like

304
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200
you know left or right or politics i'm

305
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,680
just saying go to the source because i

306
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
believe the associated press wire over

307
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
some other site that i may never even

308
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
heard of or some local news that may be

309
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
editing it to get their own agenda

310
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
across so go to the source think

311
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,959
provenance and also look at it if you're

312
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,440
looking at some some weird blogs well

313
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
where are they getting their information

314
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,160
from are they citing sources

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
and that's important so think provenance

316
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
and think lovely fields of lavender

317
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,920
so another thing that's very important

318
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
to me so one i really wanted to use this

319
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
flavor flav photo but i also want to

320
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
talk about the importance of time and

321
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,440
date when looking at articles now

322
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,959
obviously date is important right

323
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
because you want to know when it was

324
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
written and time is important because

325
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
especially

326
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
for instances like a data breach or

327
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,720
a war or something other breaking news

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
you could have a story that was

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
published 15 minutes ago that's already

330
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
outdated that's already bad information

331
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
and what i really love and i get i give

332
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
extra points to the organizations that

333
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
will show you when they originally

334
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
published it and then the time of when

335
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,200
they updated it it's like yes

336
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
so that's really important think about

337
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,639
that when you're you're reading

338
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,279
information of when was this posted and

339
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,440
how long ago was it because

340
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
things move fast right thing you know if

341
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,040
you're looking at an article at the end

342
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
of the day that was from 9 a.m

343
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
so much could have happened during the

344
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,639
day and keep that in mind so you might

345
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,760
be looking at old information now that

346
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
information might be good for historical

347
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
contents context and notice seven hours

348
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
is historical anymore right because how

349
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
quick does information move so i'm not

350
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
saying that you shouldn't read it at all

351
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
because that might be a good base right

352
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
but don't write a report or don't give

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
advice based on something that's seven

354
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
hours old because you know like milk sit

355
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
now on the counter all day that's just

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
that news is spoiled that is just not

357
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,680
good news

358
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,120
all right

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
everybody get a little bit of your ocean

360
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
on

361
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
this photo

362
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
was making the rounds on twitter maybe

363
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
about four weeks ago i think

364
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,079
and

365
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
yes it's you know people want to show

366
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,920
their support for ukraine which i'm i'm

367
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
not objecting to but they're using an

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,959
old photo to do it so they're kind of

369
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
emotionally manipulating you so if the

370
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,399
photo here is two young kids one of them

371
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
is saluting

372
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
its tanks presumably filled with because

373
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,519
again i don't really even know much more

374
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
about this photo so i'm going to say

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,800
presumably filled with ukrainian

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
soldiers on a ukrainian tank and yeah

377
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440
it's it's cute and sweet and sentimental

378
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
but it's from 2016 people it has nothing

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
to do with the current situation and

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
i

381
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
you know i got a little bit too philly

382
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
and i decided to take on uh replying to

383
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
people who were posting this saying this

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,880
is from 2016. um

385
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
so yeah that's not really the great way

386
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,639
to do that so then i put my oh my own

387
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
post up here of like look everyone this

388
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
is from 2016. i just did a simple

389
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,199
reverse image search it took me two

390
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,040
seconds and there were so many different

391
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
sources that posted it from 2016. and so

392
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,839
of course the backlash i got was you're

393
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
ruining fun there's no harm in it

394
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
it's a slippery slope come on

395
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
i showed you i went from tracy's gritty

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,519
to

397
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,760
tracy hates all of you

398
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,800
in you know in three slides so like i

399
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
said i i think that people always think

400
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
themselves well there's no harm in this

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
girl there is harm in everything okay

402
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
so

403
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
this is what i want you to be mindful of

404
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
be mindful of when things were posted

405
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
date time who posted it was it reposted

406
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
was it reshared

407
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
so i'm going to leave it to allen

408
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,160
iverson

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
we're talking about citations we're not

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
talking about practice we're talking

411
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
about citations quick show of hands who

412
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
knows this reference

413
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
come get a piece of candy from me later

414
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,320
this is

415
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
later not later

416
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,320
i know it's good candy but just wait

417
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
wait um so we're talking about citations

418
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,240
here now i know some of you might be

419
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,839
having some flashbacks from school of

420
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
like oh my gosh i don't you know i don't

421
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
want to put this information in in the

422
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,360
proper i don't know which way to

423
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,199
properly list the author and all that

424
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
stuff i'm just asking you to be mindful

425
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
of the contents of a citation

426
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
and there's the different kinds here i

427
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
don't did you know that different

428
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,920
disciplines

429
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,079
have their different ways of citing

430
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,320
information so you know literature

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
foreign languages they use mla

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
i double e engineering

433
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,839
so

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,440
it's not that i want you to memorize

435
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
this and memorize the formats i just

436
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,519
want you to think about the ingredients

437
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
you know what what goes into this so as

438
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,440
you're reading something

439
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,199
does this have a date does this have a

440
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,839
time do i know where it's coming from so

441
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,440
and then when you're you're sharing

442
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
information

443
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
honestly now past me would cringe at

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,279
this but honestly right now me

445
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
i really don't care if it's in the price

446
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
the right citation format if you just

447
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
have the information of where you got

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,079
something from you know what you're cool

449
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,199
in my book okay i get really aggravated

450
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
when i see people presenting things

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
without citations now you're probably

452
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,399
looking at my slides going okay

453
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,399
hypocrite these are all hyperlinked with

454
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,959
my citations when i post them for

455
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
public consumption i will make it

456
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
clearer but i just wanted to look pretty

457
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
my citations are there but for the

458
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
purposes of this demonstration they are

459
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
embedded so i just want you to think

460
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
about citations and another way to think

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
about it is real easy you want your who

462
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
what who what where when why how

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,160
you know this this is just a simple

464
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
thing to keep in mind as you're reading

465
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,480
or as you're sending information are you

466
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,639
hitting all these points are all these

467
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,720
points necessary is there anything

468
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,199
you're leaving out um you know i give a

469
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,799
talk called empathy as a service to

470
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
create a culture of security and one of

471
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,439
the tips i always give is listen to what

472
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,599
the end users are not saying

473
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
so here

474
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
when you read an article

475
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
what's not being presented is the why

476
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,160
not being presented is the why being

477
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
being speculated or is it being cited to

478
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
another source so that again this really

479
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
isn't a heavy lift it's just something

480
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,919
like you get

481
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
you get used to with as allen iverson

482
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
said previously in a slide practice you

483
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
get used to it with practice and this

484
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
makes you a better consumer of

485
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
information and makes you information

486
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
literate so i want to give a kudos

487
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
to the register

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,039
so not only do i know where it's coming

489
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
from it's coming from the register

490
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
and it was written by ann thompson he's

491
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
a great dude by the way my twitter

492
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
friend ian you can follow me he's at ian

493
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,280
thompson there um

494
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
and then they the register always puts

495
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
the date and time and the time zone this

496
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,919
is

497
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,960
i hate when i i hate when when stories

498
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
post the time but they don't say what

499
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
time zone okay well that's great is it

500
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,080
sydney time is it you know istanbul time

501
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
what time zone was it because again this

502
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,960
matters

503
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
now this also lists ian as being in san

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,559
francisco

505
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
now depending on what you're looking

506
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
into this could matter so for example

507
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
this is a tech article so you might

508
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
ration in your mind of okay well he's in

509
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
san francisco he's adjacent to silicon

510
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
valley he's probably in tune with all

511
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,679
this stuff you know maybe

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,039
and that's not to say that somebody in

513
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
topeka wouldn't be tuned in to tech

514
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
stuff but think about it more like

515
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
geopolitical

516
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,320
if somebody's writing an article and

517
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
they show that they're based somewhere

518
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,679
that's going to affect their point of

519
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,840
view and their bias right so it's just

520
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
something to consider where is this

521
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,240
person writing the article from uh and

522
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
just keep that in mind so

523
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
now we're going to transition into

524
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
some of the the tools that i think will

525
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
help you

526
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,799
um better kind of get to the bottom of

527
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,320
wiping out disinformation and

528
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
misinformation

529
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,679

thank you for those of you who got that

558
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,159
um but yeah this is my number one go-to

559
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,080
tool that i want to share with you is go

560
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,320
to cesa.gov mdm there's a lot of tools

561
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,919
there and i just wanted to show this one

562
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,679
they have so much more

563
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
so another one this only came out like

564
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
the other day so honestly i don't have

565
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
much more information to share about

566
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
this but uh president biden has develo

567
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,159
has stated that he wants this

568
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
disinformation government's board to be

569
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
created under homeland security

570
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
that is pretty much all i have to say

571
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,440
and talk on the show about that um i

572
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
know that some people are are are

573
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,559
voicing their opposition to this um

574
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
all i'm going to say about that is

575
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
ask why

576
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
why are they so afraid of of

577
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,440
of information literacy becoming part of

578
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,520
the government um and that's kind of

579
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
that's the most i'll get into politics

580
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,400

609
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
your kids young right we were talking

610
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
earlier about starting kids yum with

611

cyber security skills we'll start to

612
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
teach them yum about recognizing bad

613
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,760
information um just quick true story

614
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
when i

615
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,480
was a kid in the 80s um

616
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
and please like raise your hand if you

617
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
also heard this too

618
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,919
the rumor going around was that you

619
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
could get aids from mosquitoes

620
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
i absolutely remember does anybody else

621
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
remember that

622
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,919
yeah like so you're outside at night as

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,520
a kid trying to have fun catching

624
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
lightning bugs and it's like oh watch

625
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
out there's mosquitoes you're going to

626
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
get aids like

627
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,280
you need to be able to teach the kids to

628
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
understand and like and step and stand

629
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
up for themselves you know like i don't

630
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
think you're what you're saying is true

631
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
i think you're spreading some fibs and

632
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,799
because that's how kids talk these days

633
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,240
but no empower empower your kids to be

634
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,039
critical of information because again

635
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,640
then they're going to grow up and that's

636
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
stuck with me that stuck with you know

637
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,640
all this time it's not i didn't forget

638
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
it because it was so traumatizing uh so

639
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,000
so anyway so i don't need to read

640
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
through all of these um but i just want

641
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
to point out there's a lot of great

642
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,000
resources out there so and the other one

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
i just wanted to point out real quick is

644
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
you see the pointer institutes media

645
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,960
wise and media wise on espanol

646
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
one of the problems is a lot of

647
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
non-english speakers

648
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
are being targeted specifically for

649
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
disinformation

650
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,520
you can just easily look up stories

651
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
about the latino community

652
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
there's a lot of

653
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,279
covid vaccine disinformation purposely

654
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,080
being

655
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,600
being spread to them

656
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
i know in india there's a lot of issues

657
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,240
with disinformation going on

658
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,760
so as bad as you might think it'd be in

659
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
an it might be in english there's also

660
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
groups of non-english speakers that are

661
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,240
being targeted

662
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
and that's not fair i mean people

663
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,200
especially when it comes to covet people

664
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
die people have died from believing this

665
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,440
disinformation that was targeted to them

666
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,159
and that's that's criminal

667
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,039
so

668
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,120
again if any of you have uh people who

669
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
would would better understand this

670
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
information in their native language

671
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,600
look for it online and that's another

672
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
point that i i share just with security

673
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,799
talks too

674
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,840
if you have a user base that's that's in

675
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,480
latin america or in south america are

676
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,360
you giving them your security protocols

677
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
as a company to follow in english and

678
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
expecting them to fully understand it

679
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,080
are you translating those materials into

680
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
spanish and portuguese same thing with

681
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
this all these warnings need to also

682
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,000
come in their own languages because

683
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
expecting someone whose fourth language

684
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
is english to fully understand these

685
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
nuances of this complicated topic is

686
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
just really unfair and a disservice to

687
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
them so be mindful that there

688
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
there should be and we need more

689
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,880
translators to help with this to get

690
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
more information out in other

691
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
non-english languages

692
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
so long farewell avidas

693
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,120
so i want to give you a couple parting

694
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,360
thoughts here i hope i hope this was was

695
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
useful and helpful

696
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,200
uh we have about five minutes left so i

697
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,480
think i will have time for some

698
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
questions and some candy distribution

699
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
um or just candy distribution if nobody

700
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,799
has questions

701
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,000
so

702
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
two things i want you to think about i

703
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,279
have these two slides here i want you to

704
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,320
think about so first

705
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,679
you better think think think about what

706
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,840
you're trying to put out into the world

707
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,840
when it comes to information so

708
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,679
i want you to think

709
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,039
now this doesn't apply to every

710
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,440
situation but it could if you think

711
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,559
about it

712
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,919
is what you're reading or what you're

713
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,720
putting out there is it true

714
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
is it helpful are you adding to noise

715
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
you might think that you're helping well

716
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
i'm going to help save the world if i

717
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,760
retweet this article about ukraine are

718
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,799
you just adding to the noise like really

719
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
are you really helping

720
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
and also putting out information oh my

721
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
hot hot take on this is going to save

722
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,880
the world is it

723
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
is it really

724
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
so think are you being helpful is it

725
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
inspiring now some of the news that we

726
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,919
share isn't particularly uplifting

727
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,080
so maybe you can think about inspiring

728
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
in a different way

729
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,080
is this providing a call to action to

730
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
change something because that could be

731
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,120
inspiring right

732
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
because a lot of times i think people

733
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
see inspiring and they think warm

734
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,640
fuzzies inspiring can also get somebody

735
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,039
off their butt to do something like stop

736
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,520
spreading disinformation

737
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
is it necessary again are you adding to

738
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,880
the problem

739
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
i don't know about you but i want to be

740
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,760
part of the solution not part of the

741
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
problem so is it really necessary to

742
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,080
share your hot take on the johnny depp

743
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
trial i don't think so

744
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
i really don't think so and is it kind

745
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
and again you can think of kind

746
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,559
different ways you know are you

747
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
slandering someone

748
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
or you know

749
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
is it you know again this is all kind of

750
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,159
tied together so i want you to think

751
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,120
true helpful inspiring necessary kind

752
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
and then the last thing i want you to

753
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,159
think about is do we have any rupaul

754
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,760
drag race fans here woohoo

755
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
if you'll remember rupaul's drag race

756
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,279
season two episode one the lovely

757
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,279
tatiana gave a spoken word presentation

758
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,320
um called all the same parts

759
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
and one of the best lines was because

760
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
what you see

761
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,760
isn't always the truth so please heed to

762
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,720
our lord and savior tatiana and remember

763
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,120
that everything you see online isn't

764
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
always the truth

765
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,559
so thanks han

766
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,360

773
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,849
[Music]

774
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,679
yeah i'm just putting it out there

775
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,360
because i want people to be mindful of

776
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,000
the date and time and yes if something

777
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,159
is developing then yes go back and see

778
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,640
something updated i just don't i i

779
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
understand your question but i'm just

780
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,200
saying i just threw that out there

781
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,399
because i don't know that people

782
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,159
particularly pay attention to the time

783
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,240
that things were posted and put that in

784
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,120
context of the event oh and what i was

785
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,799
going to say too is i forgot to mention

786
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,000
this earlier

787
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
i hate it um i wasn't going to call

788
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,840
anybody out

789
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,600
tech target but um some publications

790
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
do not put a date or time on at all i've

791
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
actually had to look at source code

792
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
which is that like a felony in missouri

793
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
now i don't know where did that land

794
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
i've actually had to look at source code

795
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,159
for an article that i really wanted to

796
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,080
use because i really wanted to get to

797
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,159
the point of well when was this posted

798
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,760
if i have to look at your source code

799
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,600
you are doing a terrible job as a news

800
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
disseminator so like i'm looking i'm not

801
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,240
going to jail for looking at a date you

802
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
know i mean that's just ridiculous so

803
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,159
anyway yeah i just want to say this i

804
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
just want to put i'm sorry i just want

805
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
to give the context of if there is a

806
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
good reason to pay attention to the the

807
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
date and time but thank you for your

808

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,880
shut up sorry let me just finish the

834
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
story real quick the other guy in front

835
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
of me ran over to so um

836
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
so i

837
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,679
i was on the train looking at my twitter

838
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,720
feed and i started seeing people

839
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,240
mentioning kobe

840
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
but i was like i don't know like that

841
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,399
scene this easily seems like it could be

842
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,520
a rumor and whatnot so i remember i

843
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,159
remembered that tmz

844
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,399
really is a actually is a really good

845
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,960
resource when it comes to celebrity and

846
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,640
la based news so i went to tmz's website

847
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,039
and i saw that they were reporting it

848
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,960
but i checked other places and they

849
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,440
weren't reporting it yet and i wanted to

850
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
say something because i grew up in the

851
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,600
same county that

852
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
kobe was from he went to lower marion

853
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,519
high school and i went to a rival high

854
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,519
school so of course i wanted to share my

855
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
thoughts with the world because

856
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,440
i think we passed in high school at some

857
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
point or something like that anywho um

858
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,960
but also i want to know whether or not

859
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,720
it was true so i kept checking these

860
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,919
other stories kept checking kept

861
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,399
checking so what i normally do is and

862
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,000
some of you might be thinking

863
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
ain't nobody got time for that okay but

864
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
listen it really doesn't take that long

865
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,880
i triangulate so i already had tmz and i

866
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,720
kept checking kept checking and then cnn

867
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,159
came through and then they were

868
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,159
referencing tmz like what the gentleman

869
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,640
was just talking about and then cbs

870
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
finally reported and then they were

871
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,200
citing tmz and other sources and then

872
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
citing the the sheriff and and all this

873
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
stuff that's when i was like okay this

874
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,039
is true so damn sorry you know r.i.p

875
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,360
kobe but then i felt comfortable

876
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,919
proceeding to then tell people i texted

877
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,840
my husband like did you see this kobe

878
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
news so this is just what i do

879
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,039
personally about triangulation which i

880
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,320
believe is what you were you're getting

881

that sir um you also got into another

882
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,000
