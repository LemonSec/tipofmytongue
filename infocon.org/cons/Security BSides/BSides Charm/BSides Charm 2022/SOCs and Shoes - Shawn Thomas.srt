1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,760
is everybody enjoying the con so far

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,359
all right cool this is a lot more than

3
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,800
the five people that i expected to show

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,599
up so thank you all

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
thank you

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
there will be uh there will be presents

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
for best heckling or questions

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,120
[Music]

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,879
there we go

10
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,559
so i'll do a little bit of an intro

11
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
before we dive into it my name is sean i

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,719
am the head of forensics and incident

13
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
response at yahoo

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,840
that includes security operations what

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
most people would call sock we don't

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,960
call it that anymore

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
as well as

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
incident response and forensics program

19
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
and there's some engineering mixed in

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
i've run a bunch of socks built a bunch

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
of sock programs i was a breach

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
consultant way back before that

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,240
and i host a couple podcasts when i have

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,040
time i also suck at twitter but feel

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,479
free to hit me up there like i answer

26
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,200
messages anyway

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
so let's dive into it what is the sock

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,159
or security operations center in this

29
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,439
because i realized when i throw it out

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
on twitter

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
everybody gives you some cheeky answer

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,600
that sock stands for something else even

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
though it's pretty clear that this is

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
this is what i'm talking about

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,240
opinions range pretty wildly right i

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
believe the description of the talk says

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,560
is just a place where dreams go to die

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
anybody in here actually work in

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
security operations by the way

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
oh good quite a few people

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,320
of those people how many of you really

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
really love it

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
versus how many of you people are hoping

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,600
or how many people are like hoping for

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
more

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
i'll take that

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,879
so disclaimer

48
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,200
experiences vary wildly these are

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,959
different everywhere you go

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,360
different programs run different ways i

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
mean we run our program very differently

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,800
than every other program i've ever seen

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
but let's kind of break into my

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
definition here

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,360
is one of

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
if not the most important part of a

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
security program

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
now we could toe to toe and say

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,160
vulnerability management is up there

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
pretty good too

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
because vulnerabilities matter but

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,519
at the end of the day that is your front

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
line those are the people that are there

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
to stop bad actors from doing something

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,640
why are we here

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
find badness protect users

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
four words very simple your mission

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
statement may vary

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
but we're gonna focus on kind of those

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
four words for now

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
because that'll help break into kind of

72
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
the rest of the concept of the talk

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
so what is it usually like

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,480
well honestly

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,959
it has the least experienced individuals

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,400
how many people

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
think that stocks are entry level jobs

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
that they are

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
how many people think that they should

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
be

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
i see a couple we can we can address

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,840
that

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
they're given little to no trust or

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,799
ability

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
so click button

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,720
do thing follow playbook don't think

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,319
they have low visibility or an over

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,879
reliance on tools

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,360
they deal with a mountain of different

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
alerts which breeds into this concept of

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
fatigue and they have almost no control

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
over what that means for them or in

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,080
their life

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
they're not empowered to find a root

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
cause any cause to investigate to

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,599
remediate

97
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,280
they can't fix security problems they

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
can only escalate

99
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
they face this concept of death by a

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
thousand cuts in a lot of ways

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
and they become a stepping stone

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,519
something to get away from something to

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
get out of

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
so anecdotally what i will say is it

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
doesn't have to be that way

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
i've got folks who have been with me for

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
20 years

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
in an operations role

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
my average is somewhere between like

110
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
three and nine

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
right now

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
because it's all about how you scope

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
this to meet the mission so why is it

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
like this

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
ooh

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
moving pictures

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,360
why is it like this

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
well we hit it a little bit there's a

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
lack of a clear mission or purpose that

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,520
exists

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
there's a lack of trust in individuals

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
there's these tiered structures of these

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
artificial boxes that people are given

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
segmentation infighting ego because we

125
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,919
don't have any ego in this industry

126
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,159
right

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
a need to justify itself to the business

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
why are you here or what most people

129
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
would call metrics help

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
and because that's how it's done

131
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,239
everywhere

132
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
i got to remember that the images move

133
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,440
when i click the button again

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,479
so let's dive into these issues

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
so let's talk about that lack of clear

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
mission or purpose

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
so what happens if you have that and i

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
kind of broke down all those problems

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
with the reasons why they exist right

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
so you have that mountain of alerts

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
you're not empowered to find root cause

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,280
you can't fix things because you don't

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
know why you're there you're there

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
because you're a compliance checkbox

145
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,000
you're there because

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
you're the entry-level position that

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
escalates to something else you're not

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
in a position where you can actually

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,280
make a decision or better a program

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
so let's break that down for a minute

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
why are we here

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,199
find madness protect users

153
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,880
if you can extrapolate everything down

154
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
to a very simple mission statement

155
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
especially when you're in an operations

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,360
world

157
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
you can take that whole concept and you

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,759
can say everything that comes in

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
everything that they want you to do

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
does that meet my mission

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
does that help me find bad stuff does

162
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,520
that help me protect my users no

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
well then we're not gonna do it

164
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,759
if it does then let's figure out the

165
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
best way to go thank you for coming late

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
tj welcome it's tj knoll everybody

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
it's tj noll

168
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
nerd

169
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,639
thank you

170
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
so lack of trust and personnel

171
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
this is a big one and part of this is

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
because so many people see

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
in operation center as

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
an entry level job

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,080
people come in

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
they're not allowed to do something

177
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,600
because they click this button and they

178
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
could break something

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
so let's talk anecdotally about that for

180
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
a second as i look at my legal rep

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
who if she starts shaking her head i

182
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,960
have to be careful so if this if this is

183
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
bad like a bad story it's her fault

184
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,960
not mine

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
bear

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,800
so i had an intern a couple years ago

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
that i hired who's now a full-time

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,120
employee

189
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
three years

190
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,039
we had a big case not going to say what

191
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
not going to say who none of that

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
big case

193
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,800
old intern running the case three years

194
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
experience still a junior technically in

195
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,479
our program

196
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,919
part of that case involves reaching out

197
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
to an external third party cso and

198
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
basically interrogating the individual

199
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
who did it me as the person who runs the

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
program our cso

201
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,960
no

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,319
the intern who became a full-time

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
employee why

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
because we trust him to do a good job

205
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
and what did he do

206
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
a great job

207
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,639
damn good job

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
if you give people the ability and trust

209
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
to do things they will surprise you and

210
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
they will do a great job

211
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,919
so let's hit that

212
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
every person that you hire you hire for

213
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
a reason from the intern

214
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
which i actually think my this year's

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
intern is probably in the crowd

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,120
somewhere

217
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
to you see so

218
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,639
because they had a skill

219
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
because they brought value

220
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
what that means is they deserve a voice

221
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,960
and trust

222
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
that's paramount if you want to build a

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,599
good team or you're evaluating teams

224
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,560
that you might want to be on and you

225
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
want to be on a good team find a place

226
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
where you're trusted where your opinion

227
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,759
matters regardless of your level

228
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,720
so tiered structures swim lanes

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
again a whole bunch of stuff that you

230
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
have to deal with

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
this all kind of comes back into the

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,479
trust piece but from a business function

233
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
perspective this one is probably makes

234
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
the least sense to me

235
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
i understand the risk that something can

236
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
break that's a real thing but honestly

237
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
call that a learning experience move on

238
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,319
it's cool

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,560
the problem is

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,919
and there are places lower than the

241
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
basement i have learned that

242
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
the problem is

243
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
why short yourself on people like as a

244
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
business leader why short yourself on a

245
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
person if you have a junior who wants to

246
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,040
do more why not let them

247
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
what how does that hurt you what does

248
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,560
that do for you

249
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,839
does it hurt you

250
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,839
if they mess up maybe give them some

251
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
guardrails maybe

252
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
but you're just

253
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
not getting the value that you could out

254
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
of a person who clearly wants more and

255
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,880
then they're just going to leave and go

256
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,760
somewhere else and do more anyway

257
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
so

258
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,600
do away with the artificial barriers

259
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
so we use tears internally for

260
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,760
expectation

261
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
and it's only for expectation

262
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
it does not change their job or what

263
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
they do

264
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
but we expect more from higher level

265
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
employees but that way every employee

266
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,080
who comes in including our interns gets

267
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
an opportunity to experience and do cool

268
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
stuff

269
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,800
that's really important

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,959
that gets people interested involved and

271
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,160
engaged

272
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
and if you want to have good security

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
people who are actually investigators

274
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
rather than people who click buttons and

275
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
paint by numbers you need people who are

276
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
interested and engaged

277
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
segmentation infighting and ego

278
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
yes

279
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,230
[Music]

280
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
hey

281
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
you build growth

282
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,560
intern wants to do malware do malware

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
it depends on the stock but honestly

284
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
it's usually a year or less maybe a year

285
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
and a half

286
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,320
but what i was saying up front is ours i

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,240
mean we're looking at you know three to

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,000
20 years somebody

289
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,440
supporting them but

290
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
my experience as soon as they get good

291
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,120
they leave for greener pastures

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
so that speaks to the cultural problem

293
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
of the sock that they're in right

294
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,880
so

295
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,600
what if the greener pastures

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
don't exist

297
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
what if you are the greener pasture

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
so what if you make the job interesting

299
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
enough to be the greener pasture so i'll

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
tell actually i'll hit on this when i

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,160
talk about segmentation and fighting and

302
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,360
ego because it's really interesting

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,959
oftentimes in a security organization

304
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
there are two separate teams well three

305
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
there's a detection engineering team and

306
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
threat detection and response there's a

307
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,519
security operation center and then

308
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
there's an incident response function

309
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
right

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,880
detection engineering makes sense that's

311
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
a very specific skill set you know

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
building things and kind of keeping up

313
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,160
systems

314
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,519
but incident response and security

315
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
operations what's the difference

316
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
anybody

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
okay before and after

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
what

319
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
depth of investigation okay

320
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,920
so

321
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
neither of those things

322
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
need to impose a difference

323
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
they don't

324
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,600
before and after is a really good one

325
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
and i like that because

326
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
the person who investigates before might

327
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
have more information than the person

328
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,320
who investigates after and you might

329
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
actually suffer from that

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
likewise depth of investigation you're

331
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
limiting folks from being able to go

332
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,959
deeper why

333
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
so we actually it's funny as i give this

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
talk

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
we shut down our sock

336
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
aka we took our ir function we took our

337
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
security operations function and we

338
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,279
smooshed them together

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,480
we said hey

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
we own everything from start to finish

341
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,399
so we own alerting and monitoring we own

342
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
threat hunting we own incident response

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,399
mitigation remediation automation all

344
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
that kind of stuff

345
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
it's working phenomenally well

346
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,279
because we're taking these skill sets

347
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,360
where sock people often have way more

348
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,279
experience and way more to bring than

349
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,040
what most people think because they're

350
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
in these logs every day they know what's

351
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
there they know how to look at it they

352
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,399
might just lack that after piece because

353
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
nobody lets them do it

354
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
and some of the ir folks are really good

355
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
at the after piece but they miss the

356
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,800
beginning piece because they don't spend

357
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,399
their days understanding an environment

358
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
or digging into something they only get

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
called when there's a problem

360
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,880
so bringing those two things together

361
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
expands both skill sets in a meaningful

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
meaningful way

363
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
and like lets people do just cool

364
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,320
all the time and that's really what it's

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,839
all about right like let people do cool

366
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,079


367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,279
how did i do it

368
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
so we never like shut it down

369
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
we made a proposal as you do on business

370
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,880
stuff

371
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,320
that said i think this would be a better

372
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
structure for a group of teams

373
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,240
people liked the proposal the teams

374
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,079
liked the proposal which that was the

375
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,440
first group that i ran it through was

376
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
the teams

377
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
and we said hey cool we're gonna take

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
this we like it we're gonna smush it

379
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
together we're gonna try it out

380
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,360
we built up a whole bunch of new things

381
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,880
that leveraged the skill sets we built a

382
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
more formalized hunt program and a whole

383
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,639
bunch of other stuff and said boom here

384
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,000
we go

385
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
and like it runs phenomenally we have

386
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,600
sock people who never would have got to

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
work cases and do real investigations

388
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
doing phenomenal investigations

389
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
and we have the ir people bringing so

390
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
much of that knowledge and stuff that

391
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,839
they have from the back part that

392
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,680
they're becoming phenomenal monitors and

393
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,279
finding really cool stuff

394
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,160
right

395
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
it's an awesome concept

396
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
and it works really well

397
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
but the other piece to it

398
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,680
we can't lose sight of why we're here

399
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
at the end of the day that's what's most

400
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
important what are we here to do

401
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
somebody recently said to me i don't

402
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,040
care what we do or how we do it i just

403
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
care that what we do is the right thing

404
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,720
so if we could all just take a moment

405
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
and say what is the right thing for us

406
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,600
the right thing was not having a

407
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
separation between ir and operations

408
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
because it didn't really work

409
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,880
the right thing was how we best protect

410
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
the business how we best protect the

411
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
business is by having full scale whole

412
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
way through the life cycle people

413
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
who can provide that expertise

414
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
that was the right thing

415
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,199
the ego doesn't matter none of that

416
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,720
matters like we're there to protect a

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
thing and that's everybody in infosec

418
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
that's not just operations people or ir

419
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,800
people

420
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,320
red teamers the works across the board

421
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
like we're all there to make a company

422
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
safer and like to protect users to

423
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,519
protect people to protect whoever like

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,760
that's what we're there to do

425
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,959
if we don't lose sight of that we can

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
actually make really good decisions

427
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,680
about how we can best achieve that

428
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
outside of our own personal goals

429
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
which are important

430
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,079
so

431
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
a need to justify itself to the business

432
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,320
this is a fun one because this is the

433
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
one where where i talk about metrics and

434
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,399
everybody goes ugh

435
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
numbers

436
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,079
math

437
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,000
numbers in math aren't that bad but they

438
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
do get misused a lot

439
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,160
and it's really easy to misuse numbers

440
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
in math

441
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
spin a good yarn

442
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,079
tell a story and tell the right story

443
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
the numbers at the end of the day serve

444
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,160
as a purpose of telling a story

445
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,839
to move you in a direction that needs to

446
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
go be honest about it like don't

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,600
manipulate them because that's not cool

448
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
right like data is important

449
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,680
but we want to tell a story so what kind

450
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,839
of stories do you want to tell

451
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
well we might want to know who's

452
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
attacking us that's a good story we

453
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,120
might want to know what they're

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
attacking that's a good story we might

455
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
want to know if our work input is more

456
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,759
than what we can keep up with on any

457
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
standard variation so like capacity

458
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,440
modeling that's a really good story

459
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
notice that at no point am i talking

460
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
about individual metrics because those

461
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,639
come way later and for the most part

462
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
like if you trust your people

463
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
you have less of a need for that

464
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,959
until you don't anymore

465
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
but what story do you want to tell

466
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,839
and then how are you going to use that

467
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,000
story to get things that you might need

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
if you use a managed service company

469
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
right and a lot of folks do

470
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,040
can you quantify how much of the whole

471
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
managed service companies time is spent

472
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
in your environment versus versus

473
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,680
somebody else's and how much money that

474
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,079
they're spending that's a cool story

475
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
because that could lead you to say oh it

476
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
would actually be better for me to hire

477
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
my own people

478
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,600
right

479
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,199
i'd be better off if i went down that

480
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,240
route because i could either be cost

481
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
same or cost better

482
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,440
and get better service

483
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,199
so it's all about how you use data to

484
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,039
tell a story but data is important

485
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
metrics are important

486
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
but numbers for numbers sake are

487
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
worthless don't don't worry about it

488
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,839
figure out the question that you want to

489
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,959
answer

490
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,400
and figure out the story that answers

491
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
that question honestly i actually

492
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,079
recommend everybody who does this at an

493
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,359
analytical level

494
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,319
or like as an ic talk to your leadership

495
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,799
and say what do you care about

496
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,480
and then you can help kind of build what

497
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,080
they care about right

498
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
so this last one

499
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
this is like my pet peeve

500
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
the because that's this is how it's done

501
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,720
everywhere

502
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
i've spent so much of my time like

503
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
building operations programs fighting

504
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
with people who say

505
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
well industry standard is this

506
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,919
clearly the industry standard doesn't

507
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,120
 work

508
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
let's be honest

509
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,640
so i'll say this about it

510
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
we are hackers

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,679
we challenge norms we innovate we adapt

512
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,200
we change

513
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
that's what we need to be

514
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
that's what we need to do

515
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
there should be no industry standard

516
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,840
that comes across especially one that

517
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,960
doesn't work

518
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
that won't cause us to try to change

519
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
something or make something different

520
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
like that's important

521
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
i realize i'm coming up on time here

522
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,080
pretty quick so let's put it all

523
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,480
together

524
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
run cool security operations and let

525
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
people do cool it's really the end

526
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
of it but questions folks

527
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
that works surprisingly well at 20

528
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
minutes

529
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
i mean i don't i don't see any reason

530
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
why i can't talk about some of it but

531
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
i'm getting a no head shake so

532
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200
how do you handle the 24x7

533
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,400
do you have 24x7 and so how do you stamp

534
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
that with

535
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
some of your more senior people who have

536
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,240
been munched into this thing so we

537
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,960
we actually kind of stagger

538
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
throughout the day so instead of your

539
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
typical like shift to shift to shift we

540
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
stagger across the calendar for the most

541
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
part

542
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
so it's just like we're so let me hit

543
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,640
the first one first right working with

544
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
compliance is like working with legal

545
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
hold on i'm getting to a good part here

546
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,480
they don't have to be your enemy

547
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,720
you can use compliance

548
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
so people complain and gripe about

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
compliance teams a lot you know what

550
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
compliance does though they give you

551
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,200
teeth

552
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,799
teeth are valuable

553
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
you need teeth to accomplish things so

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
instead of sitting through the audit and

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
going oh such a pain in the ass like sit

556
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,080
down and talk to them about what your

557
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
real problems are figure out how you can

558
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,000
map those to different regulations and

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
then figure out how you can use that to

560
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
get the things that you need to move

561
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
forward that's teeth that can push the

562
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
businesses to do things that you need

563
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
them to do or the rest of the business

564
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
to do those things

565
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,039
look at them as friends and not enemies

566
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
you always need leadership to buy into a

567
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
thing like i hate to say it but you kind

568
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
of always do yes

569
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,799
about what his job

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
the is uh he gets to come to me and be

571
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,760
like look here's this issue uh we need

572
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
to change it and i go great let's

573
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,919
formulate that in a legal plan and tell

574
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
the rest of the people on compliance and

575
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
leadership that this is actually a thing

576
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,760
that hurts

577
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,960
she is an awesome lawyer

578
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
you wouldn't be able to do this if you

579
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
don't forge a partnership with your

580
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,960
legal counsel legal counsel are kind of

581
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,760
like

582
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
uh rabid cats you have to approach them

583
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
carefully and be very nice with treats

584
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
and then

585
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
she's right that i actually gave her the

586
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
ticket to come here very nice with

587
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
treats also come up come up and get a

588
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
present

589
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,559
you come up take a present

590
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
yeah you get treats too good question

591
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
as far as the cool stuff goes look

592
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
man it's like it's ir like ihoar is

593
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
inherently cool

594
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
like working cases and incidents is

595
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
inherently cool like that's like the

596
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,919
dirty little secret of being in this

597
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,480
field like you don't want anything bad

598
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
to happen because like you want to

599
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,400
protect the company but like you kind of

600
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,679
do because it means you're going to have

601
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
a really interesting day week month

602
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
whatever but by the end of it when it's

603
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
multi-month you're like oh my god no i'm

604
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
done i never want this to happen again

605
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
i'm not gonna get into that we actually

606
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
did we did a podcast on that with my ir

607
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,799
team

608
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,240
on the paranoids podcast if you're

609
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,760
interested

610
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
um

611
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
yes

612
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,840
which thing

613
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
we're lucky we're internal

614
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
and we're private sector

615
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,159
so i don't really have to deal with that

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
so my background is managed services so

617
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
i can actually speak to it in that

618
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
background so when you do any kind of

619
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,200
transformation it's really all about

620
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
focusing on benefit right so in this

621
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,039
case we're basically up leveling an

622
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,559
entire team and expanding job

623
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
responsibilities in a meaningful way

624
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,400
like that's an upsell that's an up level

625
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,240
you're getting more out of this you're

626
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
going to get better things and this is

627
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,679
how those things are going to look oh

628
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
and by the way you had these complaints

629
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
we're going to address those things too

630
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,719
that's how we're going to make this work

631
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,559
sure

632
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,400
so training is almost individualistic

633
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
for a certain extent right like every

634
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
person has different goals different

635
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
needs different ones ways that they want

636
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
to approach problems for some people

637
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,039
that's like sans and official training

638
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,559
for some that's shadowing and working

639
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,559
with other people i'm an interactive

640
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,400
learner so i don't actually learn unless

641
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
i'm part of a conversation for the most

642
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
part like i don't do school well i don't

643
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,679
do books well i don't do any of that

644
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,600
so understanding how people need to

645
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
learn and then being able to tune what

646
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
works best for them but i'm there's a

647
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,840
phrase that i'm a big fan of

648
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,600
you know everybody says like infosec is

649
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
sink or swim right

650
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,720
i hate that phrase but i will drop

651
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,120
somebody in the ocean

652
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,880
but i'll be standing right next to them

653
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,480
on a boat with a life vest just in case

654
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,679
they need it

655
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,480
uh who else

656
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
go ahead

657
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
right over

658
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,440
there i'm gonna ask you you call it

659
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
trust right but how much of that is

660
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,320
actually mentorship and pushing someone

661
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
to what they need to do to be able to

662
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
actually get them to do it right i feel

663
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,480
like a lot of operation centers you

664
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,919
i would say

665
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,240
that that's actually a good question

666
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
so i think if you're gonna like if

667
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
you're gonna take the time to mentor

668
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
somebody you almost have to trust them

669
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,880
right like trust is the foundation of

670
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,559
all relationships in the existence of

671
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,520
the world

672
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
like you must trust people that's the

673
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,000
very foundation of our society if you

674
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
don't trust the person

675
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,200
then you're not going to help the person

676
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,240
you're not going to want to interact

677
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,279
with the person you're not going to want

678
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,200
to do any of those things

679
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,520
so like foundationally trust has to come

680
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,720
and then all the other stuff like

681
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
mentorship comes after it that is a good

682
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,919
question though also you as well both of

683
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
you come get presents

684
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
also am i like way over now

685
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
or am i good

686
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
am i good

687
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,520
okay

688
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,918
thank you very much

689
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,720
yes however

690
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,760
it's based on

691
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,480
expectation

692
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,039
so like i expect a more thorough

693
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
something from a mid-level or a senior

694
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
now there's one stipulation to that and

695
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,799
that's that we have i have another team

696
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,480
called specialists who are primarily

697
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
focused on project work which is you can

698
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
actually throughout our structure

699
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
without getting too much into it you can

700
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
go a leadership route into like

701
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,159
associate leadership or you can go a

702
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,440
specialist route which lets you do

703
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
mostly engineering project work outside

704
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
of operations as well

705
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,400
but operations is really where all the

706
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
cool stuff happens because that's the

707
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
full ir lifecycle process

708
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
go ahead so based off of your experience

709
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,159
i've heard the same type of

710
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,760
structure what not in like the financial

711
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,440
sector

712
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
how easy or how hard you think it would

713
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,719
be to kind of push this type of concept

714
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,080
there's a reason why i don't work in

715
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
government anymore

716
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,640
um

717
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
they're very resistant to change

718
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,360
but if you have it ultimately comes down

719
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,640
to do you have a good leadership team

720
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
like i am very lucky my leadership team

721
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,919
the whole way up the chain like my boss

722
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,760
one of my best friends in the world

723
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,200
like my wife thinks we need to go take

724
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
cute pictures together

725
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,240
um

726
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,080
and my whole leadership chain

727
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
trusts me and the team to do what we

728
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,640
need to do effectively so building that

729
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
trust in relationships and again we all

730
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
come back to relationships and the

731
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,200
foundation of trust

732
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,039
build trust make change

733
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,520
like decent theme hopefully that helps a

734
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,039
little bit

735
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,559
depends on the organization probably

736
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,799
in the

737
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,840
back about how much

738
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,399
so actually is pw crack in here

739
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,399
because if he is i'll quote him red

740
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,439
teamers don't do any work

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,679
just throwing that out there

742
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
but no so look

743
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,159
the the red team back and forth ribbing

744
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,480
is all fun and i love it but like as

745
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,000
long as we all remember that we're all

746
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
there to do the same purpose and to

747
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,840
protect a company like we have a

748
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
fantastic relationship with our red team

749
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,600
we work hand in hand with them on a lot

750
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
of stuff it's really helpful and

751
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
meaningful and we can use them and point

752
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,799
them in a direction much like we can

753
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,960
point our lawyers in a direction or our

754
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,559
compliance people in a direction to

755
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
solve the problems that we see because

756
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,240
operation sees all the problems let's be

757
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,600
honest

758
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,840
there's probably time for one more folks

759
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,200
who's going

760
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,279
go ahead everyone

761
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,279
okay

762
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,559
um

763
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
ask me later

764
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,039
i'm not going to say that on a record

765
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,200
you're

766
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,080
like welcome reaches no incidents like

767
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,520
multiple security is great

768
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
how do you help a leader like chop that

769
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,720
up and say

770
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
hey

771
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
so at the end of the day the hope is you

772
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,039
know for everybody else but the ir team

773
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,080
that there's going to be no incidents

774
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,000
and no breaches right but that doesn't

775
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,840
mean that there's not attack paths that

776
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
are valuable that doesn't mean that we

777
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,559
don't want to think about how we're

778
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,679
going to get attacked that doesn't mean

779
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,880
we don't want to think about what's

780
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,480
going to be attacked and how we protect

781
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
things and constantly expanding and i

782
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,159
don't just do that to explain to

783
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,000
leadership what potential risks we have

784
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
or where we're at right i'm real key on

785
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
like even as i bring in analysts like i

786
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
don't want them to worry about the

787
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,799
alerts as much as i want them to worry

788
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,399
about like what data goes behind it and

789
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,720
what visibility gaps might exist

790
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,559
and all those kinds of things that make

791
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,399
up a bigger security program like that

792
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
is my baseline expectation from an

793
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,840
analyst

794
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,200
which is probably a little different

795
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,039
than you know what most people think of

796
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
like an operations analyst but

797
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,279
i tend to expect like think about the

798
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,840
why and think about the what if and how

799
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,919
could we go do something

800
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,240
and i mean we're always busy not like

801
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
from a breach incident any perspective

802
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
or anything like that but like there's

803
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,679
always more to do there's more to hunt

804
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,039
there's new things hitting the news

805
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
there's all kinds of stuff to keep us

806
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
occupied to look for bad because that's

807
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
what we're there for find bad protect

808
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,799
users

809
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,360
that's right on time

810
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,600
thanks everybody
