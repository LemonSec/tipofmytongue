00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
uh i'm a professional coffee drinker

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,040
over at the dod

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,480
um i'm really excited to be here to talk

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,800
about something that a project i've sort

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
of worked on for a little while

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
um something that's near and dear to me

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,559
can we move this away

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,640
uh the election security problem which

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
has kind of been a a personal and a

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
professional interest for for some time

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,199
of mine

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,879
um i've been fortunate to work on sort

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
of that problem over on the federal side

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,239
and i was excited to come here to

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,079
besides charm to talk about that too and

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,000
talk about it in the context of

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,199
uh of the conference here when we're

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
talking about election security so um

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
the small part of that problem that i

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
wanted to look at was

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
how you know election security which is

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
a big overarching problem set how that

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
was impacted and affected by

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
something that i think we're all

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,240
unfortunately individually impacted by

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
which has been data breaches

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
um so that's just kind of the small

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,759
little aspect of it i wanted to look at

35
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,119
this slide's kind of rhetorical because

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,640
i think we've all sort of the last two

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
days heard about you know what's going

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,400
on and why this is such a big problem

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,360
and why

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,759
political parties especially

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
state and local ones elections and

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,840
campaigns why they're so vulnerable and

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,759
why they're so interesting

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
for adversaries to target

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
so you know the part of it i wanted to

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
look at you know looking at data

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,240
breaches and looking at state and local

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,439
parties is because i wanted to look at

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
something that was

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
probably more easily identifiable with

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
as a you know at the individual level

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
because state and local parties are how

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,119
we you know participate in democracy

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,799
it's how we vote it's how we meet our

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
party and it's how we meet our elected

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
officials so it impacts us much more

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
personally and i think directly than

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
maybe some of the federal national level

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,878
ones do

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,399
um so i wanted to start looking at you

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
know see what what did this ecosystem

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
look like and um you know what part of

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,879
this could i take a look at

64
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,400
um so i started looking around at you

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
know some some party websites this is

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
the the michigan state republican party

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
website

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,840
and i started to notice something

69
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
on the party websites this is michigan's

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
right now they provide a lot of contact

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
information for local officials like

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
district and county level chairs

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
sometimes they're party staff

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
uh here's the vermont state democratic

75
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
party website

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
uh they did the same thing

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
i was curious if this was just a one-off

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
thing i didn't understand the time why

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
organizations were doing this so i you

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
know i kept looking

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
this is the alaska state democratic

82
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,480
party website um they actually had an

83
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,400
attachment for me you could just grab

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
emails addresses names stuff like that

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,920
um

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
here's the illinois state republican

87
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,640
party

88
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
theirs was already in a spreadsheet

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
which was handy for me

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
but i kept seeing this over and over and

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
over again here's the dc democratic

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
party website uh you said it's a little

93
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
tough to read there at the back it's a

94
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
full list of dc democratic party

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,519
committee members and their contact

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,239
information addresses personal emails

97
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
phone numbers names i didn't understand

98
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
why organizations were doing this

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
but they all kept doing it

100
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,879
personal contact information personal

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,640
emails that were publicly listed on

102
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
their website

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
this is the massachusetts state

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
democratic party website you can see

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
there at the bottom it's a little tough

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
to read there but it's one to ten of 557

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
entries

108
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
i didn't understand why this was

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,840
happening at this scale

110
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
but i realized that i'd found something

111
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
that i wanted to look into

112
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
so understanding the scale that you know

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
these parties work at that there are

114
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,120
hundreds of state parties out there

115
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
there are thousands more of local level

116
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
and district level parties under them

117
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,120
um the scale here is is significant

118
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,840
they're they're massive massive

119
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,200
organizations and data breaches you know

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
tend to also be pretty massive in in

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
comparison as well and you know

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
unfortunately as someone who's you know

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
been breached before too

124
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,799
um it's a it continues to be a problem

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
it's ubiquitous in the industry

126
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
but the reason i thought this was

127
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
interesting was because you know these

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,839
organizations were providing private

129
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,880
emails

130
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
um just in some cases volunteers in some

131
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
cases party staff

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
local and county and district level

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
chairs this was interesting to me i

134
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,759
wanted to know why they were doing this

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,360
and then i wanted to know what the risk

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
to those organizations was what did it

137
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,800
mean that you had you know hundreds of

138
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
emails on your website what would that

139
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
mean for your your risk profile what

140
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
does that mean for

141
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
um you know how secure someone's gonna

142
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,800
think your organization is

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
um it's particularly interesting for

144
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
emails too just because the way we use

145
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
emails today it's the the trusted key at

146
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
the bedrock of the online authentication

147
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
scheme we use them to log into accounts

148
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
we use them as usernames for other

149
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
accounts

150
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
as two-factor auth for all kinds of

151
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
accounts and services it's a

152
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
really key part of our kind of online

153
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
schema and i wanted to know what it

154
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
meant that the organizations were doing

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
this so my problem statement that i

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
wanted to go after was you know how to

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
quantify empirically the level of risk

158
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
for state and local political parties

159
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
caused by account exposure and data

160
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
breaches at scale

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,919
and i realized pretty quickly you know

162
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,120
you may have realized as well looking at

163
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
the first couple slides i showed you

164
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
that this was a this is a data problem

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
first before anything else and so i

166
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
needed something that was going to help

167
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
me understand and tabulate that data

168
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
so i put together this little tool

169
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
called hook shot

170
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
it lives on my public github there at

171
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
the bottom

172
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
it's very very simple

173
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,479
and it comes with absolutely no warranty

174
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,479
or guarantee of working but um what i

175
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,800
wanted to do first was to go out and set

176
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
you know with a deck of urls pull back

177
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
every email on those urls

178
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
i used cool to do this it's a it's a

179
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
tool in the default kali linux distro

180
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
it's a great open source web scripting

181
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
tool

182
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
i ran that in parallel

183
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
within the program so you can go out and

184
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
scrape dozens of these at the same time

185
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
that you know to start gives you some

186
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,319
interesting analytics because you know

187
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
one it's interesting in terms of

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
magnitude how many emails are on this

189
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
website it's also interesting in terms

190
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,199
of the type of emails you get back

191
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,800
whether it's private emails gmail's

192
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
yahoos and hotmails or whether it's like

193
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
a dot gov or a dot org or in some cases

194
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
like a dot gop or dot dem

195
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,639
so just the type of data you get back

196
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,919
just from what you've scraped off the

197
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
website can be really interesting

198
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,479
then the other the second half of this

199
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,720
tool was taking all those emails you

200
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
know by url and then throwing them

201
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
against the have i been phoned api

202
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
which is a super flexible low cost super

203
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,039
easy api

204
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
you can query against the service for an

205
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
account and it'll to return back any

206
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
data breaches that account has been in

207
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
then you can query on the data breaches

208
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
as a selector as well and it'll tell you

209
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
the type of data that showed up on that

210
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
breach password financial information

211
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
addresses super easy to use api for the

212
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,479
low low cost of like three dollars a

213
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,280
month

214
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,039
um so that's what the tool did kind of

215
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
the first two parts of it and then the

216
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
third aspect was putting all that

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
together and some kind of analytics like

218
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
what okay what does it mean to have x

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
amount of emails all this out there

220
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
when i started i wanted to run this

221
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
against all 50 states so i started with

222
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,520
100 websites which is all the state

223
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
democratic and republican party websites

224
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,360
and the results i got back were

225
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,759
a bit broader than i expected um out of

226
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
those 100 urls 92 of them listed

227
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
personal emails and on those 92 websites

228
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
i got back just shy of 10 000 private

229
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,880
email addresses

230
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
um a bit bigger than i was expecting

231
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
going into it um it's like an average of

232
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,400
100 110 per website um which to me told

233
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
me that this was much much bigger than

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,360
just those couple websites i started

235
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
looking at the start this was systemic

236
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
um of those 9900 email addresses um

237
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,199
about two-thirds just over 6000 had been

238
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
in recent data breaches

239
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,879
i don't think the organizations are

240
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
aware of that

241
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
and i'll talk a little bit more about

242
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
that later like why i think this is a

243
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
situational awareness problem

244
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
but that was you know to me that pointed

245
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
to a substantial substantial amount of

246
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
account risk out there

247
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
um i'll talk a little bit more about the

248
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
like the specific analytics that i built

249
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
into the tool but one of them that i i

250
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,080
pulled out that i thought was

251
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
particularly interesting was i sorted

252
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,479
for

253
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,800
corporate accounts.gov.gop.org

254
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
and i got 363 of those that has showed

255
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
up in data breaches on those websites so

256
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
mostly personal email addresses a lot of

257
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,759
gmail's and yahoos

258
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
but they're also breech corporate

259
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
accounts which i think to me was

260
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
interesting to look at at the individual

261
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,479
url level to drill down to that and say

262
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,639
hey you know why does this particular

263
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
state have this many like breached

264
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
corporate accounts so you can really

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
pull back some interesting sort of just

266
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
quick level looks at these organizations

267
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,958
just based on that

268
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,958
here's a couple individual results up at

269
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
the top left there that's a northeastern

270
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
state democratic party website with 989

271
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
email accounts on their website 740 or

272
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,839
so had been in data breaches

273
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,760
that was the worst offender of the group

274
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
kind of an extreme example i know it

275
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
might be a little tough to read in the

276
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
back there the one in the middle though

277
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
was a fairly typical result this was a

278
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
midwestern state republican party

279
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
website uh with about 50 emails about

280
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,839
two-thirds of them had been breached

281
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,760
and then when i ran this against an ex

282
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,839
an expanded list of urls when i included

283
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,480
third parties about 195 state level

284
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
green libertarian and constitution party

285
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,519
websites

286
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
i got back the one on the top right

287
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,279
which is a west coast state green party

288
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,320
website

289
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
fewer accounts on the website but

290
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
generally the same sort of levels of

291
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
exposure

292
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,800
which to me again kind of pointed to the

293
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
fact this was systemic this wasn't

294
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
someone doing something wrong for one

295
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
state

296
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
some of the specific account you know

297
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,839
account analytics there at the bottom i

298
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,440
wanted to put my finger on okay you know

299
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,240
what did it mean to have 989 emails out

300
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
there what does it actually mean if 750

301
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
of them are breached

302
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
so to start with you know the first kind

303
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
of easy analytic to put in you know in

304
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,600
someone's face is okay you've got six

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,920
thousand breached accounts here um those

306
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
accounts are ten times as likely to be

307
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
fished targeted by phishing at least to

308
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,399
start

309
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
if for no other reason the fact that

310
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
your information is now out there

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
and you've got personal information

312
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,640
exposed someone can go scrape your email

313
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
address off of a paste and send you an

314
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,440
email

315
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
if you're crafting sticky like

316
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,000
personalized phishing content

317
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,519
those phishing messages are three or

318
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
four times as likely to be successful i

319
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
don't even need your current password to

320
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
do that it's just based off of what you

321
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
can put into there from the data exposed

322
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
in a data breach so that right there was

323
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
i think an interesting analytic for an

324
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
organization to say yeah i've got this

325
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,959
many accounts who are now more

326
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
susceptible to being phished

327
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,839
um

328
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,360
then i kind of went a little deeper and

329
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
there was a really cool study out of

330
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
virginia tech a couple years ago that

331
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
looked at accounts and data breaches and

332
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,079
tried to match passwords between the

333
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,839
same username found that about 40

334
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,920
percent of users were reusing passwords

335
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
um so if you start with you know 6000

336
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
reached accounts you've got 2600 or so

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
potential um instances of credential

338
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,480
reuse where someone's reusing a password

339
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
or username between services that to me

340
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
is is going to be automatically

341
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
interesting as you know an organization

342
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
where yeah someone's personal account

343
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
has been exposed but now potentially you

344
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
put you know login mechanisms or

345
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
authentication at risk from my

346
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,079
organization's domain because you've

347
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,519
reused accounts

348
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
and passwords

349
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,640
then you know going down kind of even

350
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
further than that there was a really

351
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
really cool study out of google that

352
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
looked at breach gmail accounts

353
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,839
and they found that between seven to

354
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
fifteen percent of breached emails

355
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,920
included the password currently in use

356
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
for that account

357
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,640
so if you use that as a conservative

358
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
lower estimate you've got around 400 or

359
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
so credentials that have been exposed

360
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,279
that are currently in use for that

361
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,040
account and this is just because you got

362
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,560
unlucky that somebody got owned and your

363
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,920
data's out there

364
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
if you put that together and you say

365
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
okay you know these users reuse

366
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
passwords these users just got unlucky

367
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
and have their current password exposed

368
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
you've got around 180 so instances where

369
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
you could potentially have someone who's

370
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,079
reused a password that showed up in a

371
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,320
data breach that could be a valid login

372
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
to these websites if you remember we

373
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
started with only 100 urls and you got

374
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
maybe around 180 or so it's not a

375
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
guarantee but

376
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
that to me would be sort of concerning

377
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
if i've got 100 email addresses on my

378
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,480
website how many of them you know belong

379
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
to folks who've got a log into my

380
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
website if they're local volunteers or

381
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,440
district or kind of precinct level

382
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,279
officials that would be concerning to me

383
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
um does anybody want to venture a guess

384
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,279
who did it worse or who did it better

385
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
i'm willing to trade swag if someone

386
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
gets this right

387
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
who said that

388
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,959
okay get me after i'll i'll get you this

389
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,839
but

390
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
that's exactly right your average

391
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,839
democratic state party uh website had

392
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,079
100 private accounts on about 64 of them

393
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,360
have been breached

394
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,519
your average republican party website

395
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,360
a little bit more accounts but the exact

396
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
same

397
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,079
it was even pretty much the same for

398
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,839
third party websites fewer accounts on

399
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,639
them

400
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
but almost the exact same level of

401
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,279
exposure

402
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,680
that to me what that tells me this isn't

403
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,279
it's not a partisan problem it's not a

404
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,560
regional problem it's not a state

405
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
problem this is a a systemic one this is

406
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,959
a people and culture and it started

407
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,160
helping me understand why these

408
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,560
organizations were doing this you know

409
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
it's the core function of these

410
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,399
organizations to be publicly accessible

411
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,680
to interface with the public to

412
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
introduce them to their elected

413
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
officials

414
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,279
um

415
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,279
i don't think that you know the fixes

416
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,120
that you know you can suggest

417
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,560
i don't think it's just effective to

418
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
take all these emails off

419
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,079
it's you know if the party's not

420
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,680
reachable not accessible it defeats the

421
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
whole point of why the website exists in

422
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
the first place so i think when we talk

423
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,720
about mitigations and like what this

424
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
means here in a second i think that's an

425
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
important thing to think about because

426
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,519
yeah i mean you can put in technical

427
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,600
fixes but the core mission of the

428
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
organization like we heard about

429
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
yesterday like for a campaign to win an

430
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,000
election it's not going to matter if

431
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
they're not reachable they have to be

432
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,240
reachable and responsible to

433
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
constituents so that to me i thought was

434
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
interesting because it's this is not a

435
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
one organization has done it bad it's

436
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
everybody seems to be

437
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,839
doing this and i think i thought it

438
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,000
seemed anomalous at the time

439
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
another analytic i wanted to look at was

440
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,360
you know

441
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,959
has something happened related to a

442
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
website recently with a state level

443
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,720
political party that i could potentially

444
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
look at and say hey was you know was

445
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,519
there something predictive about the

446
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
data i had

447
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,480
does anybody remember when this happened

448
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,000
last fall

449
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,399
so this is the aftermath of the texas

450
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,079
state republican party website after

451
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
anonymous took it down in september

452
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
and threw a bunch of pokemon up there um

453
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
so site went down for about two days

454
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
until the admins could get uh get

455
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,040
control again they took it down for like

456
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,079
two weeks

457
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,360
put in a whole bunch of technical

458
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
controls technical mitigations brought

459
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
the site back up

460
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
i realized though that when i first

461
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,199
started working on this project i had

462
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,639
started before this happened i had

463
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,560
actually gone and scraped the texas gop

464
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
website about a month before this

465
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880
happened

466
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,240
and so i wanted to see if like the data

467
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
i had was this indicative of all i'm not

468
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
saying it's necessarily how it happened

469
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
but about anything that i would have

470
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,199
seen on that data would i have thought

471
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
that hey maybe this organization is more

472
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,880
susceptible to something similar like

473
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
just like a website takeover which i

474
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,160
would consider pretty low sophistication

475
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,839
low

476
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,920
equity a month before the hack those are

477
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,079
the numbers i got back

478
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
i'm not saying this is necessarily how

479
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
anonymous got into the website but if

480
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
you've got 236 breached email accounts

481
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
that are publicly listed on your website

482
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
the odds are pretty good that you've got

483
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,160
around 15 or so valid credentials out

484
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,440
there if someone's got a log in that

485
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,600
website and all i need is a web browser

486
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
and an email account to get them i don't

487
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,959
even have to fish i don't have to do

488
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,440
anything like that so it may not be how

489
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
it happened

490
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,959
but to me you know when i look back and

491
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,800
i look at that website then that to me

492
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,639
looks like an ample attack surface

493
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,079
whether i'm you know targeting folks

494
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,360
with phishing whether i'm crafting

495
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
particular specific content

496
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,959
or if i'm just targeting your

497
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
organization at large that gives me

498
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,240
enormous base to start from

499
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
so six months later right you would

500
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,240
imagine that things have been fixed the

501
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
website went down for two weeks they

502
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,519
renegotiate things with their service

503
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,040
provider a lot changed this was a

504
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,000
tremendously public impactful damaging

505
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
thing for the texas state republican

506
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,399
party

507
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
both in terms of like literal cost and

508
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
then also reputational cost

509
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,680
and i know they spent a long time

510
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,959
looking at this website and trying to

511
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,160
fix things and prevent this from

512
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
happening again so i figured that things

513
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,399
might be a little different now

514
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,519
um

515
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,680
this is the current texas republican

516
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
party website as of last week i saved

517
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,120
the page where they have some emails on

518
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,480
them

519
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,959
when i ran this last week and i scraped

520
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,399
the website

521
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,480
uh 342 private email accounts 322

522
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
had been breached

523
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,120
so

524
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,759
fewer emails yes but if if i look at

525
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,680
this just from the lens of my tool and i

526
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
look at the before and after

527
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,920
i see more exposure and more risk to the

528
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
organization now than before the

529
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
implemented controls and mitigations and

530
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,199
i think that gets back to like hey like

531
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,639
what's what's the problem here why are

532
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,920
they doing this

533
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
i think there was you know enormous

534
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
amount of resources put into technical

535
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,519
controls technical fixes technical

536
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,720
mitigations

537
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,000
i don't think anyone stopped to think

538
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
about what was the organization's

539
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,399
mission

540
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
how do we need to refactor that or how

541
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
can we integrate security with that to

542
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,839
build a more defensible secure

543
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,759
organization i don't think they've

544
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,120
looked at this

545
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
because to me like if i see this i think

546
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
the website is in a worse risk posture

547
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,399
now than it was before

548
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
but i think no one you know looked into

549
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,240
the people on the culture and why we

550
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
need to integrate with that

551
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
um

552
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,279
do we by any chance happen to have the

553
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
maryland ciso in the room that would

554
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,839
have been so lovely um i couldn't come

555
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,199
to you know maryland and b-side start

556
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
with having like a local homegrown

557
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
example as well so here's the maryland

558
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,599
republican and democratic state websites

559
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,839
um when i ran this tool last week

560
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,919
i'm not trying to finger point at

561
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
maryland i'm not trying to finger point

562
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,839
at texas um remember this is everybody

563
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,319
this is 92 out of 100 state parties have

564
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,640
done this but i i think it just goes to

565
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
show you that i don't think the organs

566
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
it's a situational awareness problem i

567
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
don't think they're aware of

568
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,720
what this risk pretends for the

569
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
organization what it means to provide

570
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,080
this level of contact information on

571
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,400
affiliates officials employees and

572
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
volunteers

573
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,600
and what that could mean for that

574
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
organization in terms of

575
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,440
risk for phishing risk for just me

576
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,480
logging into your website with a

577
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,400
credential i pulled off a paste bin

578
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,360
um

579
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
it's not any one person's fault on any

580
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
one state's fault some had a lot more

581
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,000
than other ones but um i think it's it's

582
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
sort of a systemic thing

583
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
so where you know where i want to go

584
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
from here um if you remember back to the

585
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
alaska state republic i think it was the

586
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
democratic party website i showed you

587
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,160
earlier

588
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
uh that was one when i actually ran this

589
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
tool last week and i went back to go

590
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
look at that attachment they had

591
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,799
scrubbed out all the email addresses i

592
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,000
don't know if it's because they saw my

593
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,679
iep cutting and their web server logs a

594
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
whole bunch it's possible

595
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,880
i'm not going to take full credit for

596
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
that but at least tells me that maybe

597
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
somebody else thought that this was

598
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
maybe a bad idea

599
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
i haven't been contacted by anybody else

600
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,039
or anything like that but

601
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,640
i think it just goes back to

602
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
understanding the mission understanding

603
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,240
the culture and then understanding

604
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
having a number and figure to put in

605
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
front of decision makers to say hey here

606
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
this is why this is a risk for you

607
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,320
as a reminder like the tool can only

608
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
pull back what it can see it can't grab

609
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
off those attachments in many cases so

610
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
this is probably a pretty significant

611
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
underestimate i didn't go to any local

612
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
or county level party websites either

613
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,400
i think the numbers would just go up

614
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
because i know state level and local

615
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
level the funding cycles are

616
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
unpredictable and a bit anemic

617
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,640
um so this is probably an underestimate

618
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
but really i think it gets back to the

619
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
issue at hand here this is a at its core

620
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
it's a situational awareness problem

621
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
it's a people problem it's not just a

622
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
technical problem

623
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,440
there's a lot of other things i'd like

624
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
to look at with this tool um i'd like to

625
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,200
go take a look at some campaigns go i'd

626
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
love to go look at the local and county

627
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,919
levels

628
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
i had someone suggest looking at school

629
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
districts as well which tend to be

630
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,120
organized somewhat in the same

631
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,880
hierarchical fashion between state and

632
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,799
counties as political parties are

633
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
um i think it you know what it helps

634
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,440
offer is a quick snapshot on a website

635
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
hey what data is out there that maybe

636
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,880
you're not aware of and what does that

637
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
risk mean for your organization

638
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
i think there's plenty to improve on in

639
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
terms of the tool

640
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
as i said my code comes with with no

641
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,559
warranty or guarantee of success but

642
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
a lot to improve on there and i think

643
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
you know for owners of those domains

644
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
there's a lot you could improve on using

645
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
that as well

646
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,679
um

647
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,039
at this point that sort of wraps it up

648
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,160
i'm happy to answer any questions

649
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
anyone's got any but i'm happy to stick

650
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
around after please don't leave without

651
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,600
me giving you a patch or something here

652
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
yes

653
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
yeah um i'd i'd love to i was you know

654
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,200
one of the reasons could have come in

655
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
here and coming to stuff like this is to

656
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
help try to get the awareness out there

657
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
um

658
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
i haven't you know heard from anybody

659
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
and i i think it's

660
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
kind of like we heard in the keynote

661
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
yesterday like that squishy sort of

662
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
perimeter like

663
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
i think a lot of those decision makers

664
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,559
are going to say hey we have to be

665
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,640
publicly reachable there are websites

666
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
and there are parties who do this like

667
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,679
well there are ones who have contact

668
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
forms and it just goes to that specific

669
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
person like the fixes are pretty low

670
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
sophistication low cost

671
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,480
um i think it's just a situational

672
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
awareness problem so

673
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,559
in

674
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,799
most cases honestly they've got ways of

675
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,559
contacting folks to like volunteer with

676
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,240
the party but you know you're given

677
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
state party website doesn't have hey

678
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
contact me with your vulnerabilities and

679
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
exposures um so yeah i've tried to get

680
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,520
the word out i tried to kind of meet and

681
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
network with folks but

682
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,200
if you know anyone i'd love to love to

683
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,679
talk with them

684
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,480
i

685
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,080
honestly i really wish i could tell you

686
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
i thought one of the

687
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
one of the most interesting things that

688
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
i you know i found with the with all

689
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,240
this was that

690
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,440
um

691
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
if you do like a you know user at

692
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
texasgop.org

693
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,159
those guys are showing up in data

694
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,480
breaches too um it's not i mean even the

695
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,159
websites who use their own domains like

696
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,600
for their typically for like state party

697
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,039
staff they'll be on sort of a corporate

698
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
domain those ones are showing up on data

699
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,919
breaches too

700
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,360
i don't it's

701
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,960
it's less about i think listing it you

702
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
know listing the type of email as it is

703
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,799
just providing it on the website i don't

704
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,039
see any other organizations that do this

705
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
it's not i mean in government or in

706
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,799
academia like you usually don't list all

707
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,159
everyone's contact information whether

708
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,320
or not it's your own domain i don't know

709
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,919

710
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,840
odd and i wanted to understand why
