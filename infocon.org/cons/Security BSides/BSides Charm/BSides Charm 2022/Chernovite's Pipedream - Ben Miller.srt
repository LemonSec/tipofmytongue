1
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,038
that went off

2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
attack surface management product uh

3
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,719
formerly a senior cyber research

4
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,760
scientist for the company called

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
security risk advisors um i've made some

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,399
open source tools all very ocd

7
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,199
and i've spoken about a bunch of

8
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,640
conferences and if you like they're

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,559
including chat about this kind of stuff

10
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
that's my contact it's a great

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,600
organization i'm pretty new to twitter

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,680
so uh don't expect much over there with

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
ics no equipment

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,840
to this topic feels who i am not ask

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
questions first and foremost i am not a

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
plumber i believe um hopefully

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,840
i've been known to find some leaky

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,760
buckets uh-huh um

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,720
blue-collar

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,119
like ics putting together

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,720
vulnerabilities um i'm also not a lawyer

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
here's my topic well this is a strange

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
um disclaimer to have to give for

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,159
retirement

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
the themes that might be the legalities

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
of accessing someone else's last year

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
as well as the previous couple years

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
messy

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,159
there's not a lot of litigation uh

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,079
beyond a couple of small examples to

31
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,200
talk about

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,079
we're gonna be talking a lot about

33
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,399
google docs

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
now this slide you might find offensive

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
uh due to that

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
when i'm talking about documentation

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
specifically these are the kinds i'm

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
talking about the file types that spin

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
the cogs the world of business these are

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
the files that we interact with these

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,600
are typically the file types we're

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
trying to protect um as enterprise

43
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,038
defenders

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,160
from getting out and transferring the

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
files that store everything focused on

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
the business around uh

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
control systems now in terms of

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,319
publication

49
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
i break publication

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
categories the least common one is

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
intentional um this is you know

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
releasing marketing each of those boxes

53
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
releasing product documentation

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,480
the most sophistication that these

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
activity groups have tracked uh and

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,319
demonstrated

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
and it's mapped to the industrial

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
control systems cyber kill chain uh so

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
if you're familiar with the traditional

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
cyber security kill chain

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
uh they're

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
it's a series of steps i think it's

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,519
seven steps uh from uh initial

64
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,200
uh

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,879
initial delivery all the way to

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,319
exploitation or action on objectives uh

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,640
and so we we would consider that stage

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
one of uh

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
gaining access in the environment

70
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
gaining persistence and then um

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
the the action on objectives would be

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
moving on to stage two which is

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
gaining access into the industrial

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
control systems environment from stage

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,360
two

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
uh you're developing a capability you're

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,159
reconning what the industrial control

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
systems

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,959
look like and then you're finally you're

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,760
disrupting or having some sort of effect

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
on the industrial control systems

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,959
environment

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
the vast majority of the activity groups

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,519
that we track represented by those

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
little coins there are what we would

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
call ics curious stage

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,239
so they've

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
started attacking uh and gaining access

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
into the it environments for various

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
asset owners

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,480
they've started

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
doing reconnaissance

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
attacking suppliers

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
vendors and oem

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
providers for some of these environments

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,720
but they haven't actually gained access

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
into the industrial control systems

98
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,280
environments what's interesting there is

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
unlike in in the it space ics space

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
uh is a much more selective uh and

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,680
they're in much more of a

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
growing of a capabilities perspective

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
and so it's interesting watching them

104
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
from the early days of gaining that

105
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
capability or understanding that they

106
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
need that capability doing that recon

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
doing that capabilities development

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
which is where the vast majority

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
of these activity groups are

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
and then it starts weeding out from

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
there so the next category there of

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
stage two see essentially

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
as uh activity groups adversaries have

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
gained access in the

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,240
industrial control systems environment

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
but they haven't done anything there uh

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,720
uh but they're actively collecting data

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,520
they're exfiltrating information um uh

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
and they're they're positioning

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
themselves within within those

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
environments for a later date whatever

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
later date that may be

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
and then the cream of the krem

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,919
is the stage two on the action stage so

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,320
these five activity groups have

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
demonstrated some sort of capability to

127
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
disrupt uh and impact industrial control

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
systems uh this goes uh

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
this ranges from electrum uh responsible

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
for a 2016

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
uh ukraine attack against transmission

132
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
that led to a power outage in kiev

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,080
to xenotime attacked a refinery in saudi

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
arabia with a piece of malware called

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
triton also known as trisis that tripped

136
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
that that refinery several times and

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
actually

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
could have led to a safety event

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
for the personnel there they actually

140
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
targeted the safety systems of that

141
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
refinery in order to trip that refinery

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
so that's the level of sophistication

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,440
that we

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,039
were speaking to

145
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
when we talk about adversaries that have

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
stage two capabilities

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
uh and and now we're tracking a new one

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
as of a couple weeks called called

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
shernovite so cernovite is

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,880
built a

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,440
good next slide uh shernovite has built

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,960
a toolkit uh dub that we dub pipe dream

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
uh a mania also refers to it as in

154
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
controller if you've heard of in

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
controller

156
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,120
uh and pipedream is you is notable in

157
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,960
that it's only the seventh malware that

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
has been developed that has ics uh

159
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
capabilities embedded into it so think

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
of all the malware strains out there uh

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,160
that that you may be familiar with

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,120
there's only seven that can uh impact

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,039
industrial control systems that are

164
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,520
known uh the last uh that i mentioned

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
was uh triton also known as trisis that

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
was deployed in 2017

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
and it was discovered uh in 2018

168
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
so you're talking about something that

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,160
is continuing to escalate as far as

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
these capabilities are

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,759
being developed more and more

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,039
but still

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,680
a one two three year sort of uh time

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
frame for for some of these tool kits to

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
be discovered and that's what's a unique

176
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,120
and a unique opportunity to uh truly

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,840
dive into them and understand what what

178
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
what the new capabilities are so

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
chernovite is the the threat group that

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
we associate with building uh pipe dream

181
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,479
uh they didn't actually deploy up or

182
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,360
uh

183
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,479
activate pipe dream that had a effect

184
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,680
that we're aware of within within um

185
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
well the world

186
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,039
and it looks to be that

187
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,919
a lot of the the cues in there are

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,240
towards

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,720
targeting net liquid natural gas

190
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
facilities uh and i'll speak to that uh

191
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
through some of the targeting that uh

192
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
they illustrate with their tool set uh

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
but the important aspect there is

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,120
how these tool kits were developed

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
allow for a much broader range of uh

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
being able to deploy this tool set so it

197
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
would be very

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,319
simplistic to say oh well i'm not in the

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,560
lng vertical so i don't need to worry

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,479
about that i think would be the wrong

201
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
take away when you're looking at the

202
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,800
pipe dream capabilities itself

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
what chernovite and the pipedream

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,800
software targets are a range of uh plcs

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,599
so pro program logic controllers uh

206
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
these are

207
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
uh again something that you could see at

208
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
the ics village if you stop by there

209
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
later today but

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,399
they're really just dumb little

211
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,640
computers if you if you haven't had a

212
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
chance to touch a plc they're taking

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,760
input uh and they're doing some logic on

214
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
that input and then they're they're

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
doing some sort of output uh so

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
input may be

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
uh sensing the volume of of liquid in a

218
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,519
tank

219
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,399
uh and then the logic identifies that

220
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,120
that tank is full so the output it turns

221
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
off a valve to stop filling up that tank

222
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,240
as

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,760
a simple example of what a plc would do

224
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,800
the pipe dreams

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
kit

226
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
is

227
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
focused on

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,959
affecting these range of embedded

229
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,600
devices so omron plc schneider electric

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
plcs uh uh and and some of the software

231
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
associated with that uh but again one of

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
the takeaways is while that software is

233
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,360
configured to target these

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
there's nothing to suggest that you

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
can't load in another configuration and

236
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
target a much broader set of plc's so

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
again the takeaway isn't

238
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,839
oh i don't have the schneider tm-251 so

239
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
i'm good

240
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
uh the the takeaway is actually some of

241
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
the underlying software that it's

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
affecting that

243
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
i'll talk to uh such as codesys

244
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
is applied in hundreds of uh vendors uh

245
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,040
plcs uh and thousands of different uh

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,519
makes and models uh so the the scope of

247
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
this is much larger than just what's on

248
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
here the software itself is focused

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
configuration wise on these uh these

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
devices

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,920
so i'm going to step by there's five

252
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,560
tools that are embedded within pipe

253
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,079
dream pipe dream is more of an

254
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
overarching term for each of these

255
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
binaries uh and as i walk through here

256
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
you um

257
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
will kind of set the stage for what

258
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
these attack sequences could look like

259
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,920
using all of these tools we don't think

260
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
they were designed in a way that uh

261
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
they're used sequentially it's more of a

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
a key chain of sorts that the the

263
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
adversary would have in order to

264
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,240
leverage that as needed

265
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,440
and

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
they could also be used independent of

267
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
each other ultimately

268
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,120
the first one

269
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
dubbed lazy cargo

270
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,519
is really focused on your more

271
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,880
traditional enterprise network

272
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,760
environment it is it's essentially the

273
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,880
dropper

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
that is uh used by shernovite and the

275
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
dropper itself is using a

276
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
a

277
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
known exploit uh

278
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
i don't have the cve the cve is a 20 20

279
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
50 15 368

280
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
which is

281
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,160
a

282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
a signed binary it's a driver for

283
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
motherboards it will work on any pc

284
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
though it's not particularly focused on

285
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
any motherboard

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
and that signed

287
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,079
driver

288
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
allows for remote code execution for

289
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
unsigned binaries so it's essentially

290
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
the dropper

291
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,760
that shernavite uses on windows hosts in

292
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,320
what you would uh traditionally think of

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
as uh the delivery and exploitation

294
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,279
stages of the ics kill chain

295
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
uh and then the next tool

296
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
is dubbed dust tunnel is really the c2

297
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
mechanism the persistent mechanism that

298
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,839
would again be

299
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
deployed in a traditional

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
it environment or

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,959
higher up in in the

302
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
uh the various levels of the ics

303
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
environments where

304
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,279
uh

305
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,399
the

306
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
system operators the the engineers would

307
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
be all working on

308
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,200
traditional windows equipment

309
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,639
and then it gets a little bit more

310
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,240
unique from there

311
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,839
so opc

312
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,120
ua

313
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,040
is a protocol that is seen in industrial

314
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
control systems environments it is a

315
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,480
translation protocol so if your

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
human machine interface which is

317
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,959
ultimately like an operator machine that

318
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
is

319
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,760
accessing getting data points from a plc

320
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,160
it may not understand the proprietary

321
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
protocol of that plc the glue between

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
that is opc that will have a driver for

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
that that protocol and to speak to that

324
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,120
hmi so it's really like a

325
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
a translation mechanism that's used by

326
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
opc uh and there's there's kind of two

327
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
paths here with uh using mouse hole with

328
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
opc ua

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
one of them is certainly just a

330
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,839
reconnaissance of identifying opc ua

331
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,959
servers

332
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
enumerating the

333
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
the um equipment that are behind those

334
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,519
servers and understanding some of the

335
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
the tagging information that would be

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,639
behind there

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,959
when i say tag it would be

338
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,120
a particular i o point on a particular

339
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,000
controller might be tagged as uh tank

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
one as an example and if you access that

341
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
tag you're talking about the the data

342
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,360
value that's behind it so it's 500 or

343
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,120
1000 or you can manipulate that tag and

344
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
turn it to zero uh which would have a

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,720
uh downstream effect uh to to that

346
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
device

347
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,040
what's notable with opc uh is the the

348
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
predecessor to opc ua is opcda

349
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
which is a older protocol doing the

350
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,399
exact same thing it's actually based on

351
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
ole from if you're

352
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
from back in the day without windows 3.1

353
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
windows 95 you had object linkable

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
what is stand for object link embedded

355
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,800
pieces of

356
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
code

357
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,399
and opcda is based off that which is to

358
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,320
say very insecure

359
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
but regardless uh opcda was used in the

360
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,199
uh ukraine 2016 uh

361
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,839
attack in ukraine that led to a

362
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
transmission substation outage

363
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,120
uh by crash override also known as in

364
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,240
destroyer uh that basically changed the

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,760
the uh and turned on our open breakers

366
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
within the substation

367
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
whereby de-energizing the the lines

368
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,839
within the substation

369
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,760
which uh

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
hole is interesting in that it takes

371
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
that idea of the attack but it extends

372
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,519
it into a new protocol a more modern

373
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
protocol uh and adds a little bit more

374
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,240
sophistication more depth and

375
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
understanding of that protocol rather

376
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,800
than

377
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
the the simple

378
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,519
one

379
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,399
kind of encoded binary or encoded packet

380
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
that the crash override would send out

381
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
this is a much more deep understanding

382
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
of that protocol itself

383
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,720
which ultimately allows for multiple

384
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
muscle mousil to not only communicate

385
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
with

386
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
the uh these pieces of equipment

387
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
but also change settings within that

388
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,880
equipment now that's interesting that

389
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,920
that

390
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,639
you

391
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,839
may assume that allows for a great

392
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,600
effect within these industrial

393
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
environments whether it's a substation

394
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
or a lng facility but without

395
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,079
understanding those pieces of equipment

396
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,959
how they operate and the the the

397
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,800
the industrial control systems process

398
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
itself it's kind of just spraying and

399
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
praying at that point you need to have a

400
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,360
solid

401
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,199
understanding of the engineering aspect

402
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,440
that's behind the industrial process in

403
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
order to have a larger effect

404
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
so that's mouth cell the mouse hole the

405
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
first kind of

406
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,320
uh tool that's really focused on

407
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
developing a capability within the the

408
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,279
ics environment uh and and optionally

409
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,199
giving giving the attacker some ability

410
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
to to execute the attack

411
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
with the the right prerequisite

412
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,120
knowledge that's embedded in that

413
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
facility

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
moving on to something a little bit more

415
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,839
sophisticated evil scholar

416
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,399
is the next tool set uh this is a

417
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
framework that's actually in python

418
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,839
it um because of some of the

419
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
libraries it uses it only runs on linux

420
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
hosts

421
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,279
you can think of it more of

422
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
something like metasploit

423
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
where you have a shell capability to to

424
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
actively

425
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
interrogate manipulate

426
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
and and

427
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
change the

428
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
the states of the schneider electric

429
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,679
plcs

430
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
it it's interesting in that it has

431
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,799
a lot of capabilities in in the back end

432
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,480
so this wasn't

433
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
something that was whipped up very

434
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,799
quickly it has

435
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,880
support for three different protocols uh

436
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,199
two of them are proprietary protocols

437
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,240
and it's not simply replaying a packet

438
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
it is

439
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,240
uh that the library that that is within

440
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,520
evil scholar

441
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,840
is

442
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
a fairly robust implementation of the

443
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,400
protocols in the day so the first one uh

444
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
schneider electric broadcast uh protocol

445
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
essentially as it sounds is uh broadcast

446
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
uh to the the broadcast domain looking

447
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
for schneider electric devices so these

448
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,640
uh plc are these plcs or devices will

449
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,120
respond back uh when when receiving this

450
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,240
broadcast

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
so that's identifying all those pieces

452
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
of equipment

453
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
the next protocol the the codesys

454
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,559
protocol

455
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
which rides on the 1740

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
is

457
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,520
going to then provide uh enumerated

458
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
details of that of that plc so what was

459
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
that the model number was the make uh

460
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,360
what are the the cards all within the

461
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
backplane of the device

462
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
and

463
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
some of the other auxiliary information

464
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,559
thereof

465
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,120
and then modbus is

466
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
actually a less sophisticated uh

467
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
implementation in evil scholar is

468
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,320
basically

469
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,039
a

470
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,120
open source library called

471
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
pi

472
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
modbus that you can find on github and

473
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
they they did some extensions of that

474
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,559
library itself but modbus is a

475
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,600
a protocol that is widely used has been

476
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
around uh

477
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,600
since before the internet before modbus

478
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
it was it was a implementation on serial

479
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
devices

480
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,679
and then that serial protocol moved its

481
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,080
way to modbus and allows you to

482
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
read and write variables

483
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
from the memory space of the plcs

484
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
and i'll get into an example of how that

485
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,039
can be used shortly

486
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,720
ultimately evil scholar represents a

487
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,280
a robust sort of framework for the

488
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
adversary to once they have gained

489
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
access into these environments to

490
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
explore the environment understand the

491
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,400
environment

492
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,799
and develop capabilities

493
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,799
around the schneider electric plcs

494
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
it does have full

495
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
file system access to these devices so

496
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
it can modify files on the plc it can

497
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,320
look for files and list files

498
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,679
download files

499
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,240
it can do denial of service it can crash

500
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,120
it can wipe the memory of the plc it has

501
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,919
a full capability towards there one of

502
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
the features it does have that makes it

503
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
exceptionally unique

504
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
is the ability to proxy

505
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
so one of the the focuses of industrial

506
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
control systems or for the threat actors

507
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
is

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
ultimately understanding the name of the

509
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,600
game which is once you have access in

510
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
the environment you can largely do

511
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
whatever you want so defenders focus on

512
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,000
segmentation and

513
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,760
and removing that that

514
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
carp launch access into these

515
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
environments which means firewalls lots

516
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,320
of firewalls and lots of places

517
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
the evil scholar actually can route uh

518
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,799
through

519
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,520
a

520
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,640
a firewall to a piece plc and then use

521
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
that plc to send traffic to other plcs

522
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
so that a very traditional sort of

523
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
communication structure would be an

524
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,880
engineering workstation which is what

525
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
would program a plc would have

526
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
legitimate access uh to that pill plc so

527
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,799
there would be uh

528
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,400
authorized communication even if there

529
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
were a firewall to communicate to that

530
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
device

531
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
and evil scholar uses that to his

532
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
advantage to then

533
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,360
also embed uh commands and send them to

534
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,919
other devices uh uh in the next layer

535
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,200
down

536
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
that the the engineering workstation

537
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
would not have access to uh so if

538
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
the adversary is looking on gaining

539
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
access to other parts of the network

540
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
beyond what the firewall allow them to

541
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,679
do this would allow them to tunnel and

542
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,240
have that capability which is a unique

543
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,799
and and something that

544
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,720
certainly is new from a threat model

545
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
perspective that the the industry hasn't

546
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,640
uh fully uh grappled with yet

547
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
next up is bad omen so while evil

548
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,919
scholar was focused on schneider

549
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
electric plc's uh

550
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
bad omen is focused on omron plc's uh

551
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
this is essentially

552
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,919
uh

553
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,200
what's interesting about the industrial

554
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,600
control system space is

555
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
with um

556
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,240
i.t you're used to linux and and windows

557
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,960
and

558
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,799
cisco in in the ics space you have

559
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,760
hundreds or really even thousands of

560
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
oems that are producing software some of

561
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,120
them are on linux some of them are on

562
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,600
embedded windows devices but the make

563
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,559
and model numbers are so great so omron

564
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,240
is just another manufacturer that has

565
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
their own implementation

566
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
for plc's and bad omen is targeting

567
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,880
that

568
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
that plc device

569
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,520
on a number of years ago i guess like 15

570
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
or 20 years ago

571
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
plcs started adding

572
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
uh

573
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
web servers uh to their plc's from an

574
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
administration perspective similar to

575
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
how your router may have a

576
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,679
a web administration interface

577
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,120
and this is what bad omen takes

578
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,080
advantage of so bad omen actually uses

579
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,480
the cgi interface off a web

580
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,480
a web server that's listening on the

581
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,000
omron devices

582
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,640
and all of its functionality is based on

583
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
exactly that

584
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,360
uh uh this

585
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,000
this tool bad omen looks much more

586
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,640
dev friendly and that uh it can take

587
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
packet captures uh up from uh from its

588
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
tool it can enumerate the file system

589
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,440
uh it has the ability to implant uh

590
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,760
binaries within the the

591
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
um the plc itself so think like rootkit

592
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
sort of behavior

593
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,720
on this embedded equipment

594
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,799
it has the ability to take

595
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
backups to restore backups says the

596
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,360
ability to

597
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
change the the program logic that's on

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,280
the plc

599
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,400
and

600
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
uh be able to tamper and wipe with uh

601
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,159
the memory of the controller itself so

602
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
carp launch access to really uh

603
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,679
manipulate uh the the omron psc uh plc

604
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,000
itself

605
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,880
speed up a little bit uh this is a

606
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
a bit of what the communication

607
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,240
structure uh looks like on the the cgi

608
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,559
interface as far as the i mean it's just

609
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,400
http it's sending hdv commands to a cgi

610
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,360
uh

611
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,120
asking

612
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,159
for a set uh

613
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
structure of changing the program mode

614
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,559
and then clearing the memory and then

615
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
resetting the the controller and then

616
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
putting it to a run state which is um

617
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
it's empty at that point so it's it's a

618
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
brick

619
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
if this series of

620
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,960
if the wiper aspect were implemented

621
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
and again this is command line interface

622
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
uh like shell sort of prompt where

623
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,400
they're

624
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,919
they have a set commands and they're

625
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,880
just issuing them to to the devices not

626
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
unlike metasploit

627
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
so the attack scenarios uh if you were

628
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,200
to stage these together

629
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,159
really what you're looking at is a

630
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,159
a series of tools that could be deployed

631
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
in stage one of the ics skill chain as

632
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
well as stage two lazy cargo and dust

633
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,039
tunnel are really that that initial

634
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,679
delivery and exploitation piece within

635
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
the either the traditional enterprise

636
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
network or or the

637
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
the higher levels of the industrial

638
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
control systems environment as well as

639
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
dust panel dust tunnel being able to

640
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
deliver the the c2 mechanism receive new

641
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
commands uh and implement those on the

642
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,559
windows devices

643
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,320
the next stage down there is where it

644
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,880
gets more interesting on the stage two

645
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
uh components there

646
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
so mouse hole

647
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
all three mousel evil scholar and bad

648
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
omen allow for

649
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
the enumeration of these devices

650
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,640
uh that are within the industrial

651
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,679
environments uh as well as increasingly

652
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,240
the manipulation thereof

653
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,320
now that the challenge and the challenge

654
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
of attacking industrial control systems

655
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
environments in general

656
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,200
is that you have to understand what that

657
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
industrial process is doing and how to

658
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
change it so certainly

659
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,520
if you

660
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,480
just

661
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,279
prayed and sprayed with uh opc and doing

662
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
a bunch of rights across a bunch of

663
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,000
devices you may have any facts but

664
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,039
you'll have no idea what that effect is

665
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,120
or or if it's meaningful in any

666
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,480
substantial way

667
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,240
without understanding

668
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,320
the industrial process behind that and

669
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,799
what it is

670
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
so a more graphical representation of

671
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
what that this sort of scenario would

672
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,159
look like uh dust tunnel on the

673
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,240
enterprise side level four which is on

674
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
the more enterprise network

675
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
uh mousel being ideally suited for uh

676
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,640
level 3.5 which is where a lot of the

677
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,440
the

678
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,240
software aspects that need translation

679
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,320
occur in that level 3.5 or level 3

680
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
and then as you move further and further

681
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
down you can see how evil scholar

682
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
and bad omen are

683
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,840
gaining access to plcs

684
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
as well as safety equipment that can be

685
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,039
used and manipulated

686
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,240
i'm not going to go through the

687
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,120
recommendations all of

688
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
surenovite and

689
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,039
the pipedream malware capability is

690
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,840
a not only the 7th malware that has

691
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
these capabilities it's also it's the

692
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
one that has the most depth of

693
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
capability the most understanding of

694
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
some of these protocols and what they

695
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,960
signify

696
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
but also has the most

697
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,240
breadth of being able to tack a

698
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
numerous level of plcs rather than one

699
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,080
particular model one particular make

700
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
some of the libraries that it focuses on

701
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,320
with code sys which is the

702
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,159
kind of the the development environment

703
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
that would be embedded on these plcs it

704
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,840
is used much more broadly as i said than

705
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,480
schneider electric it is used across

706
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,399
hundreds of manufacturers

707
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
so really it only takes some minor

708
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,360
tweaks to have a large impact

709
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,760
across these plc's

710
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
additionally

711
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,440
the grid here is the ice miter attack

712
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,440
framework for industrial control systems

713
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
and and pipe dream represents about 30

714
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
36 percent is i believe the exact number

715
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
of uh coverage of all known ttps for a

716
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
miter attack for ics

717
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
uh and so that's a broad range of just

718
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,480
the

719
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
tools techniques procedures uh that that

720
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,880
is being used that is understood to be

721
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
valuable in inside of the industrial

722
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,760
control systems environment

723
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,640
that that's a broad coverage and broad

724
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,039
capability that they have

725
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,600
there are a number of resources uh if

726
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
you are interested in in industrial

727
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,120
control system space and and some of

728
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
this certainly the pipe dream report is

729
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,200
available uh the year in review which is

730
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,159
what i was going to present on uh is is

731
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,360
also gives a high level view of the the

732
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
uh trends that we're seeing from a

733
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,840
vulnerability perspective and threat

734
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,240
perspective and then the ics cyber kill

735
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
chain which was

736
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,080
quite a bit old at this point but it was

737
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
written by mike asante and rob lee in

738
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,399
2015

739
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,559
has more or less stood the test of time

740
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,880
from a good model of looking of what

741
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
these intrusions look like from an ics

742
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
perspective

743
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
so that is my talk i'll welcome the

744
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
b-sides glad to be here i hope this uh

745
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
added some some flavor for y'all

746
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,279
appreciate it

747
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,399
you
