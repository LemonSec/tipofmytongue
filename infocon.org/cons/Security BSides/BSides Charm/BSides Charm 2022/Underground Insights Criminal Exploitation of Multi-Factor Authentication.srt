1
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,680
so my name is adam bumgarner i am part

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,279
of the accenture cyber threat

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
intelligence

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
organization and today i'm going to

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
speak about

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
how cyber criminals are exploiting

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
multi-factor authentication based on

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
chatter in the deep and dark web

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
so a little bit about myself i've been

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,879
in the cyber threat intelligence space

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,680
for about 15 years i have focused on

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
deep and dark web research pretty much

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
that entire 15-year period so i have a

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
very in-depth knowledge of how the cyber

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,199
criminal ecosystem functions i do a lot

16
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,239
of english and russian language cyber

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,879
crime research and analysis with the

18
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
specialized focus on the threat actors

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,600
and the threat groups that are

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,840
perpetrating the financially motivated

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,119
cyber crime

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,119
i am responsible for leading a team of

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,960
about five analysts

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
that

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
also do deep and dark web research so i

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
oversee their their day-to-day

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
activities and their longer term deep

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,159
and dark web research reports

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
so today i'm going to discuss how cyber

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
criminals are

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
exploiting multi-factor authentication

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,759
through a number of different methods

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
that i've seen during my research in the

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
deep dark web

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,600
first i'm going to talk about

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
ttps tactics techniques and procedures

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,000
as well as some mfa exploitation trends

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
how cyber criminals are using malware

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,000
and malicious tools to bypass mfa along

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
with phishing

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
token cracking sim swapping exploits and

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
how criminals are

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
bypassing mfa to steal cryptocurrencies

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
so an a quick overview of some ttp's and

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
trends that i've seen during my research

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,840
so this research it was collected from

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,639
january 2019 through present

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,800
and during the course of my research i

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
found actors discussing multiple

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
techniques for bypassing multi-factor

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
authentication

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
those are mainly through the five five

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
following uh techniques malware

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
malicious tools

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
phishing token cracking sim swapping and

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
signaling system seven ss7 attacks

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
just a quick overview i

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
loosely defined malware as just

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
malicious software for capturing mfa

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
codes from sms messages and

61
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,879
authentication applications

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
malicious tools are software that i

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
wouldn't classify as malware it can

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,879
include

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
checkers and brute forcing tools for

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
bypassing mfa on

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
bank accounts

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
fishing pretty straightforward that

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
includes fishing services and fishing

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
kits that criminals advertise on forums

71
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,879
and

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
kits that rely on

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
versions of popular open source

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
legitimate uh pen testing tools

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
sim swapping is also pretty

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
straightforward it's just services

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
through which malicious actors will

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,959
obtain new sim cards and transfer

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,840
ownership of sim cards to themselves for

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
nefarious purposes

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
and ss7 is a system of protocols that

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,920
enables

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,319
telephone networks to exchange the

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
information necessary for transmitting

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,720
phone calls and sms messages

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
as well as enabling users of one cell

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
network to use another when traveling

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
abroad for example

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,799
so over the past three years or so

90
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
accenture analyzed the underground

91
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,720
market the deep and dark web for illicit

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
products and services for mfa

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,760
exploitation and we found actors

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
offer threat actors offering the

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
following goods malware malicious tools

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
currency withdrawals which is bypassing

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,879
multi-factor authentication to steal

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
cryptocurrencies from both digital and

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
cold wallets

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
phishing phishing services phishing

101
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
pages

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
mfa resets which is resetting

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,280
multi-factor authentication on

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
cryptocurrency accounts

105
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
cash outs which is the process of

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,918
withdrawing funds by bypassing mfa on

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,839
cryptocurrency accounts

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
tutorials that

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,800
of

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,880
really any kind that explain how to

111
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
bypass multi-factor authentication from

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
one criminal to another

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
sim swapping exploits

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
mobile carrier accounts that are

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
compromised and for sale in the

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,600
underground as well as insider threats

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
that are advertised on the cyber

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
criminal underground from

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
criminals that claim to have insiders at

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
legitimate companies

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
so

122
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,919
there are a lot of discussions not

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
surprisingly in the deep and dark web

124
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,440
about

125
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,199
exploiting multi-factor authentication

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,600
but two trends that are particularly

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
unique are that we saw

128
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
discussions about

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,919
cyber criminals exploiting multi-factor

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
authentication through legitimate pen

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,520
testing tools called evil genics and

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
modlishka

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
and what the criminals have done is

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
they've taken these open source tools

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
evil genics and malicious and have uh

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,440
modified them to for malicious purposes

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
so evil genix was developed a couple

138
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
years back and the developer describes

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
it as a man-in-the-middle attack

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
framework used for phishing credentials

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
and session cookies of any web service

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
while modelishka was developed in 2019

143
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,639
and legitimate penetration testing tool

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,840
to highlight weaknesses in multi-factor

145
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,960
authentication the developer describes

146
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
it as a powerful and flexible http

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
reverse proxy capable of supporting

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
ethical phishing tests through an

149
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
automated reverse proxy component that

150
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
has a universal 2f8 bypass support

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
so first i'm going to discuss malware

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
and malicious tools that i've seen in

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
the deep and dark web that criminals are

154
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
using to bypass multi-factor

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
authentication

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,240
so

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
i've encountered malware capable of

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,479
defeating sms-based multi-factor

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,319
authentication and authentication apps

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,199
that generate mfa codes those can be for

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
you know the popular applications like

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
google authenticator and microsoft

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,319
authenticator and authy

164
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,919
and others

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,120
so

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,840
a couple years back in

167
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,000
2019 i encountered a piece of mobile

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
malware called cerberus and it targets

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
android devices and one of the neat

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
functions of it is in that it included a

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
2fa grabber and it can intercept sms

172
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
messages on infected android devices so

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
it was first advertised on the deep and

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
dark web on the russian russian criminal

175
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,680
forum called exploit in mid-2019

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,759
and in early 2020

177
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,520
security researchers observed the

178
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
cerberus malware with the ability to

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
steal two-factor authentication codes

180
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
from google authenticator

181
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
and it also cerberus also has

182
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
other features

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
that are designed to steal data

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,319
including

185
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
web injects which is code to just code

186
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
designed to steal online banking data

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
and credit card data as well and service

188
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,960
also has mass sms distribution features

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,039
but in mid 2020 the actor that

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
advertised and developed cerberus

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
actually indicated that they sold the

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
malware for an undisclosed price after

193
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,060
the team of developers disbanded

194
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,400
[Music]

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
so in february of 2022 more recently i

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
found an actor called white devil that

197
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
was advertising a piece of mobile

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,280
malware similar to cerberus called

199
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
magnus on a number of underground forums

200
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,080
both english and russian language

201
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
so magnus includes a number of features

202
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,199
similar to cerberus and that includes

203
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
stealing mfa codes from google

204
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
authenticator

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
madness is also interesting in that it

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
supports android 5 through 11.

207
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
it can gain device administrator

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
privileges on android devices

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
it can capture keystrokes it has the

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,560
ability to forward phone calls and it

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
can be controlled remotely by an

212
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
attacker via a virtual network computing

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,919
module

214
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,360
called vnc for short

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
these tools

216
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
malware malicious tools technically come

217
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
with pricing data for

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
criminals can explain how much

219
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,280
customers can rent them for and this

220
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
particular uh piece of android malware

221
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
magnus was available to rent for one

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
month for a thousand dollars

223
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
three months for three thousand dollars

224
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,879
or eight months for six thousand dollars

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
so both magnus like magnus like cerberus

226
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
has the ability to send phishing links

227
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,958
to potentially capture sms mfa codes so

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,839
it can infect other devices as well via

229
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,399
smishing

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,440
so

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080
mobile map or sorry malware not only

232
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
affects

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
obviously mobile devices but we also saw

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
found

235
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,220
malware that can

236
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,640
[Music]

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
exploit mfa on windows systems

238
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,800
namely credential sealers so this

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
particular advertisement that you see

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,399
here in the screenshot is for a piece of

241
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,560
software called nexus dealer which i

242
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,720
came across in the deep and dark web in

243
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
early 2020

244
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,600
it

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
can

246
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,160
collect mfa codes from authy um

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
but unlike the the mobile malware which

248
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
i just highlighted cerberus nexus

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
steeler targets windows systems

250
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
it supports windows systems of any

251
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
architecture

252
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,839
and it includes windows server

253
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,120
as well

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
and what's neat about

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
credential steelers like nexus is that

256
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
comes with all sorts of other malicious

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,399
capabilities it can collect data from

258
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
chromium-based browsers like passwords

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,839
credit cards cookies autofill form data

260
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,360
and browser download and search

261
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
histories it can steal cryptocurrency

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,000
wallet files it can collect information

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
on messaging applications popular ones

264
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,519
like telegram discord and jabber and it

265
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,920
can also collect data on vpn client

266
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
sessions and it also includes a feature

267
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
for file grabbing and downloading files

268
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,519
onto

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
target machines

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,240
and it's actually relatively cheap

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
so you can rent this nexus steeler for

272
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
just a hundred dollars

273
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,199
for lifetime usage

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,640
so in early 2022 i came across a new uh

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,000
piece of malware

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,519
that's also a credential steeler like

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
nexus called mar steeler which not only

278
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
collects mfa codes generated from google

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,839
authenticator and authy but it also

280
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,880
collects uh

281
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,680
mfa codes generated by tracer password

282
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
manager which i believe is associated

283
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
with the trezor cryptocurrency wallet

284
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
so mars dealer can also has additional

285
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
features that make it a bit unique it

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
can capture passwords cookies and auto

287
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
complete form data

288
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
captures browser and download histories

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
it supports more than 30 different web

290
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,640
browsers

291
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
it supports numerous cryptocurrency

292
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
plugins

293
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
it has a built-in loader and like nexus

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
steeler it's fairly cheap it's available

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
rent at the price of just 140 to 160 per

296
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,959
month

297
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
so actors are also

298
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
designing malicious tools and one of

299
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
those malicious tools that has come to

300
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
my attention in recent months is what we

301
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,160
call an otp bot and those are designed

302
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
to steal one-time passwords and automate

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
the mfa exploitation process

304
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
through features like calling fraud

305
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,959
victims

306
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,440
and the ability to obtain sms mfa and

307
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
authentication application codes

308
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
so in january 2022

309
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,720
i found the actor in this particular

310
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
screenshot highlighted here called

311
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
enigma that was advertising one of these

312
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
otp bots

313
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,760
and while i can't have not been able to

314
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
really gauge their reputation as

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
credible or not um

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
this particular otp bot that they

317
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,399
advertise is has

318
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,160
quite a few advanced features not only

319
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
does it bypass claim to bypass codes

320
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
generated by google authenticator authy

321
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
and microsoft authenticator but it also

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
claims to bypass

323
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
one-time passwords for banks and web

324
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
shops e-commerce platforms as well it

325
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
also apparently has the ability to call

326
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
up fraud victims

327
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
in an automated fashion

328
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,079
obtain one-time passwords with a single

329
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,240
call to a fraud victim and it's

330
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,519
customized for cashing out

331
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
cryptocurrency accounts

332
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,480
and it also grabs passwords for select

333
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
uh cryptocurrency accounts

334
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
and it even claims to bypass apple pay

335
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
and samsung pay verification processes

336
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
so

337
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
there are several distinct advantages of

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
malware and malicious tools for

339
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,760
bypassing multi-factor authentication

340
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
mainly that it automates the

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
exploitation process you can target many

342
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,200
victims and manage them simultaneously

343
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,560
the mobile malware and credential

344
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,040
steelers that can bypass m and exploit

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
mfa um include advanced features that

346
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
facilitate uh other illicit activities

347
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,360
and that can include

348
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,320
account theft data exfiltration uh

349
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
distributing uh further malware and much

350
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,519
more and it typically requires less

351
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
effort than fishing and sim swapping

352
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
some of the uh techniques which i'll

353
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,680
discuss here in a bit

354
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,560
so fishing to bypass mfa is also quite

355
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
common

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
as i've said but as i said in my

357
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,120
previous slides actors are actively

358
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,720
leveraging

359
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
open source

360
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
fishing kits to modify them and then

361
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
sell them on the black market as uh as

362
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,160
malicious tools and the main tools that

363
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,240
i've seen um

364
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,399
the main legitimate tools that i have

365
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
seen criminals uh modify and then sell

366
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
are called evil genics and malicious

367
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
which i

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,639
had discussed in a previous slide but

369
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
i'll uh highlight those again because

370
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
they come up again in some of the

371
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
next coming slides so evil genix is a

372
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,639
man in the middle framework used for

373
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,480
phishing credentials and session cookies

374
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
of any web service and modelishka is a

375
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,639
powerful and flexible http reverse proxy

376
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,560
capable of supporting ethical phishing

377
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,720
tests through an automated reverse proxy

378
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,360
component that has a universal 2f8

379
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,040
bypass support

380
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,920
so modlishka is really

381
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
it presents a classic man-in-the-middle

382
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
attack through fishing through which the

383
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,279
attacker tricks the victim into

384
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,680
installing a fraudulent certificate and

385
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
then redirects them to the fishing site

386
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
and despite these tools being legitimate

387
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
um you know having legitimate uses in

388
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
penetration testing um that has not

389
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
discouraged actors from modifying them

390
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,440
and then selling uh modified those

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,120
modified versions in the deep and dark

392
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
web

393
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
so one actor that i had observed back in

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
20 late 2020 was an actor named

395
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,199
consistent code00 who was advertising a

396
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,199
modified version of evil genix on a

397
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,839
russian criminal forum called exploit

398
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
so in november 2020 this actor announced

399
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,480
that they were leashing leasing a

400
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
phishing kit that was designed to bypass

401
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,560
mfa on

402
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
software platforms like microsoft office

403
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
365 wordpress as well as several social

404
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
media platforms

405
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
and according to the actor consistent

406
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
code zero zero the kit supposedly relies

407
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,760
on javascript injection to bypass mfa

408
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,839
for these particular services

409
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,040
um

410
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
so the code is the kit is being leased

411
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
for one year for a thousand dollars

412
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
which will give customers access to

413
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
pre-made phishing pages for uh office

414
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
365 wordpress and a couple of popular

415
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
social media platforms

416
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
alternatively the actor is obvious is

417
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
also leasing it for three thousand

418
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,000
dollars for one year for um

419
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
customers that will also have access and

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,399
be able to request uh phishing page

421
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,360
development on demand

422
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
so another more recent example i've seen

423
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,399
of

424
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
an actor using a modified version of

425
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
evil genix occurred in january of this

426
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,759
year when i found an actor

427
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,120
using the popular icq messaging platform

428
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,839
to advertise a modified version of evil

429
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,680
genix targeting users of a highly

430
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
popular cryptocurrency exchange

431
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
and this version of evil genix can

432
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,839
target

433
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
the cryptocurrency exchange users

434
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
capture their logins and passwords

435
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
bypasses email-based mfa for the this

436
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,880
particular cryptocurrency exchange and

437
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
not only that but it spoofs the victim's

438
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
ip address

439
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,480
and it captures their 12-word seed

440
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
phrase used to

441
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
protect the wallet which is also used to

442
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,440
recover

443
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
lost or stolen uh cryptocurrency wallets

444
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
or it can be used to be transferred that

445
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
cryptocurrency wallet to a new device

446
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
there was no

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,160
price specified for this particular

448
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
fishing kit and i also wasn't able to

449
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,240
determine the actor's credibility

450
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
so an interesting statistic that i found

451
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
in the deep and dark web is that

452
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
actors are advertising ready to made

453
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,360
ready to made ready to use fishing kits

454
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
for anywhere from as little as 40

455
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
dollars to as much as twenty five

456
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
thousand dollars

457
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,919
and all actors are will willing to

458
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,000
develop fishing kits on demand for as

459
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
little as two hundred to as much as six

460
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
thousand dollars and these fishing kits

461
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,839
are very common in the deep and dark web

462
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,480
for targeting mfa on cryptocurrency

463
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
exchanges email providers and social

464
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
media platforms

465
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,599
so one particularly interesting um

466
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,200
example i found of the fishing kit was

467
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
actually from this april on the russian

468
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,559
criminal

469
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,320
underground forum called exploit which

470
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,000
i've discussed a few times in this

471
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
presentation

472
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
so this particular actor on the right is

473
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
advertising a phishing kit for

474
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
google.com

475
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
and

476
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
it is able to create real-time clones of

477
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,919
the

478
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,880
accounts.google.com page

479
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,760
and

480
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
that includes the mfa prompts it

481
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
captures the logins passwords and mfa

482
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
codes from users that enter their

483
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
credentials it captures full cookie

484
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,480
dumps including cookies and session

485
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,600
storages

486
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
it also captures user fingerprints like

487
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
ip addresses user agents webrtc and

488
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
system fonts

489
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
it has redirection capabilities and it

490
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,799
has some other

491
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
neat features like being able to bypass

492
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
google bot guard

493
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
and it supports recaption iframes and

494
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
not only is it compatible with pcs but

495
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
it's also compatible with mobile devices

496
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,200
and the kit was being leased on a

497
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
subscription basis for 200 000 per month

498
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
so that's rather on the expensive side

499
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,799
from my experience for a fishing kit

500
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,880
so there are several advantages of and

501
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
disadvantages of phishing to bypass and

502
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,039
exploit mfa

503
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,600
it's more useful in targeted attacks for

504
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
smaller subsets of individuals

505
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
one disadvantage of phishing is that

506
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,880
requires more manual effort than some of

507
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,000
the other

508
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,760
methods that i've discussed and will

509
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,919
discuss like malware and malicious tools

510
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
one of the

511
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
really caveats to phishing

512
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
to bypass multi-factor authentication is

513
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,160
sending the phishing messages via email

514
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,200
or smishing because

515
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,039
the delivery rates the recipients can

516
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
often vary

517
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,160
you know your

518
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
your top scale email providers like

519
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,880
google are often going to be able to

520
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
recognize some of these phishing

521
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,919
messages as spam and flag them and

522
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,919
therefore the victim will just probably

523
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,360
ignore them as it will go to their junk

524
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
folder and sometimes mobile carriers

525
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
might do the same for

526
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
spam sms messages

527
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
so the next technique i'm going to talk

528
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,520
about is called token cracking to bypass

529
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
multi-factor authentication it's not

530
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
something i've observed from many

531
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,520
different actors

532
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,880
so

533
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,520
in november of 2019 i found an actor on

534
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
the criminal forum called exploit

535
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,080
an actor called x4 crew who actu who

536
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
advertised a service for claiming to

537
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
crack any mfa token

538
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
and bypassing an mfa of any website or

539
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,159
application on the planet but there are

540
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,159
caveats to that because there are

541
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
limitations in the advertisement that

542
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
they state later on but

543
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,799
x4 crow claims claims to crack numeric

544
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,520
alphabetical alphanumeric and currency

545
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
value tokens

546
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,280
and the service supports websites that

547
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,159
generate a six-digit sms and websites

548
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,320
that also charge invoice values with an

549
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,240
unlimited number of attempts to enter

550
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
the correct

551
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
token so an mfa token is just simply an

552
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
mfa code generated via sms or an

553
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,720
authentication app in this instance

554
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,559
the service has several limitations it

555
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,280
can't bypass mfa on websites requiring a

556
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,240
15-digit sms or those who are prompting

557
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
for invoice values with three attempts

558
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
or fewer to enter the correct token and

559
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,559
it's also rarely successful according to

560
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,280
the advertiser on sites with dynamic

561
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
interactions which means that

562
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,600
they involve a secondary form of

563
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
interaction after entering the correct

564
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
token

565
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
however this particular token cracking

566
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
service also supports non-dynamic

567
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
interactions where a cider application

568
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
approves a login or purchase immediately

569
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,880
after a correct token value is entered

570
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,360
and this particular service from x4 crow

571
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
cannot bypass mfa on servers that limit

572
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
the number of connections

573
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
servers with slow response times or

574
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
tokens that expire within certain time

575
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,559
frames like your typical maybe 10 to 15

576
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
minute time frame

577
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
so successful token cracking can take

578
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
anywhere from several minutes to a few

579
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
hours for a single mfa token

580
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
and it requires customers to pay into

581
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
one thousand dollar non-refundable fee

582
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,840
for target analysis

583
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,559
the actor x4 crow can also even perform

584
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,400
reconnaissance on targets with

585
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
limitations to discover vulnerabilities

586
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,919
for bypassing multi-factor

587
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,280
authentication

588
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,120
but not surprisingly the actor doesn't

589
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
provide many details on how they crack

590
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
these mfa tokens and that's very typical

591
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,360
of peop of actors in the deep and dark

592
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
web because they don't want to disclose

593
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,039
too many details or organizations that

594
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,000
deploy mfa are likely to remediate those

595
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,700
flaws

596
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,120
[Music]

597
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
so

598
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
i accept i assess with high probability

599
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
that x4 crow intentionally avoids

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
disclosing any really real intimate

601
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
details on the token cracking methods so

602
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,000
that the organizations that use mfa are

603
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,840
less likely to remediate those existing

604
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,559
so a method that has become more popular

605
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,360
in recent years is sim swapping um so if

606
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,880
you're not familiar with sim swapping

607
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
it's the process of socially engineering

608
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,919
uh

609
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,799
a mobile mobile account holder

610
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,880
to transfer their sim card ownership to

611
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
a malicious actor but it can also

612
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
involve not only social engineering but

613
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,039
the use of insiders at mobile carriers

614
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
so it involves an actor collecting

615
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
personally identifiable information of a

616
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,760
potential fraud victim that can include

617
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,080
a name a phone number an email address a

618
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,320
password or a mobile carrier pin

619
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
to see more convincing once they call up

620
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
the mobile carrier and try to transfer

621
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,159
ownership of that sim card to themselves

622
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,400
successful sim swapping enables an actor

623
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
to not only intercept phone calls

624
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
potentially but also multi-factor

625
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
authentication codes that come via sms

626
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,559
message

627
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,799
so over the over the last couple years i

628
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,760
found numerous actors that buy and sell

629
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,240
sim swapping services on deep and dark

630
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
websites

631
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
in these advertisements the criminals

632
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
that are selling these particular sim

633
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
swapping services will indicate the

634
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
country and the mobile carriers that

635
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
they will perform sim swaps for

636
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,679
and my research i've encountered a lot

637
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,679
of criminals that are

638
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,520
sim swapping for mobile carriers in

639
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,880
canada the us and the united kingdom

640
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,039
and they also typically indicate the

641
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,200
price for a single sim swap which can

642
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,000
range

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
anywhere from 200 to 2 500 for a

644
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
successful sim swap and sometimes they

645
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,159
the criminals will instead of charging a

646
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
flat rate for a single sim swap they'll

647
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
work in partnership with another

648
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
criminal to try to withdraw funds from a

649
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
cryptocurrency or a bank account and

650
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
then they'll split the profit with one

651
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,200
another

652
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,120
so a recent example of this um of sim

653
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,039
swapping that i observed was an actor

654
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,840
that called lucas koenig one who

655
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
advertised sim swapping services on a

656
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,400
russian underground forum called exploit

657
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,720
and they advertised

658
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
sim swapping services for a identified

659
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,000
us mobile carrier and they were

660
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
willing to do it for as much as twenty

661
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
five hundred dollars for a successful

662
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
sim swap which is on the very uh

663
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
quite high end

664
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,720
all customers have to do for a sim swap

665
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
to be successful if they work with this

666
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
particular individual is provide the

667
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,679
target

668
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
phone number and the associated

669
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,919
integrated circuit card identifier the

670
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,880
icc id of the number that they want the

671
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
sim card to be swapped to

672
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,919
the use of insiders to conduct sim

673
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,760
swapping attacks is also very

674
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
commonplace to bypass multi-factor

675
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
authentication

676
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,799
i found

677
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
multiple actors since the beginning of

678
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
2019 that claimed to have access to

679
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
insiders at mobile carriers

680
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
so in march 2020 i found an actor called

681
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
one two one two two that stated that

682
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
they had access to quote-unquote many

683
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,159
insiders at multiple uk mobile carriers

684
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,440
that they could

685
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,919
leverage those insider connections to

686
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,880
swap the sims and

687
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,080
intercept uh phone calls and mfa codes

688
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
and then more recently in february i

689
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
found an actor

690
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,159
called i'll pronounce it nazakive that

691
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
stated that they have access to more

692
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
than 25 different insiders at major

693
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,960
mobile us mobile carriers who can

694
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,720
perform swim swaps on their behalf

695
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
so the advantages of sim swapping to

696
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
bypass multi-factor authentication is

697
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
that sim cards are interchangeable an

698
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,279
actor can switch between not only any

699
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
sim card they wish but also the sim card

700
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,200
of the fraud victim once they have

701
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,720
ownership transferred to them

702
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,039
so disadvantages of sim swapping include

703
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
that victims can potentially regain

704
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,559
access to their phone numbers if they

705
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,960
realize they've become fraud victims

706
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
and sim swapping has become

707
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
based on chatter i've observed in the

708
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,679
deep and dark web more difficult due to

709
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,159
advances in the international mobile

710
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,760
subscriber identity or mc technologies

711
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
and some of the criminal chatter i found

712
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,520
in the underground indicates that some

713
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,440
banking systems can identify sim

714
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,279
swapping by detecting sim cards

715
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,679
associated with new mcs

716
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,200
and how that's done is that mobile

717
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
carriers and banks supposedly parse this

718
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,320
mc information through phone networks

719
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
and compare these against databases of

720
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,200
previous call records so if an mc does

721
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
not match that of the original sim card

722
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
banks may block accounts and then send

723
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
fraud notices to the bank account

724
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
holders

725
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,360
so another method that i've observed is

726
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,279
exploits to bypass multi-factor

727
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,679
authentication

728
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,520
and the main type of exploit that i've

729
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,000
seen criminals using to try to bypass

730
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
multi-factor authentication is signaling

731
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
system 7 or ss7 exploit

732
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,919
which can

733
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,799
be used theoretically to intercept mfa

734
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,000
codes transmitted via sms

735
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,880
and

736
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
as i had mentioned

737
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
ss7 is just a system of protocols that

738
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,000
enable

739
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
phone networks to exchange the

740
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,840
information necessary for users of one

741
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,520
mobile carrier to use another mobile

742
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
carrier such as when you know when you

743
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,080
travel overseas

744
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,799
overall the risk of ss7 exploitation to

745
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,960
exploit mfa is quite low and

746
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,440
historically actors have not widely

747
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,919
exploited this ss7 protocol

748
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,440
but in early 2017 ss7 was successfully

749
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,760
exploited to conduct phishing attacks by

750
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,679
unknown malicious actors

751
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,039
to bypass sms based mfa to withdraw

752
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,960
funds from bank accounts in germany

753
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,480
and as of as of this month i have not

754
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
observed in my research after selling

755
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,279
ss7 exploits but there is a demand for

756
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,360
criminals that want to purchase ss7

757
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
exploits even though there's clearly not

758
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
much of a supply really of any supply

759
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,760
um

760
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
and based on my research actors have

761
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,120
also stated that ss7 attacks may not be

762
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,919
as difficult to conduct as security

763
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,919
researchers lead the general public to

764
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,240
believe

765
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
but even with the absence of ss7

766
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
exploits for sale there's clearly a

767
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,799
demand for them

768
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
because i've seen

769
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,799
multiple ads in deep and dark web forums

770
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,320
and marketplaces where actors are

771
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
wanting to purchase access to ss7

772
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,799
exploits specifically for intercepting

773
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,399
mfa codes transmitted via sms

774
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,159
and this is one particular instance here

775
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,919
that i highlighted an actor called born

776
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,320
stunna who is on the russian criminal

777
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,399
forum xss which is

778
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,799
forum for selling all sorts of uh you

779
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,880
know personal data malware and stuff

780
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
like that

781
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,559
who in may 2020 indicated that they

782
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,320
wanted to partner with someone that had

783
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
access to an ss7 exploit to intercept

784
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,559
mfa codes sent via sms

785
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
for the purpose of what they call bank

786
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,720
jobs which are really just cyber heist

787
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,039
for stealing as much as

788
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,760
240 to 6 million us dollars is what they

789
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
claim the amount of money that they

790
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,679
claim that if they can get someone to

791
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
provide them with the 7 ss7 exploit

792
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,240
that's how much they claim that

793
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
partnership will earn

794
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
so another service that i saw

795
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,679
in the underground for potentially

796
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,039
bypassing

797
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,720
mfa exploitation is ss7 networks however

798
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,559
in these particular instances where i

799
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
saw actors claiming to sell access to

800
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
these networks i wasn't really able to

801
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
get much of a read on their credibility

802
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,000
but i have seen actors claiming to sell

803
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,720
access to ss7 networks to redirect calls

804
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
and sms messages globally for

805
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,200
intercepting mfa codes as well as to

806
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,559
determine phone number geolocation

807
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,520
so prices for accessing the ss7 networks

808
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,799
can range from

809
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,640
five thousand as much as ten thousand

810
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
dollars and in march there was an actor

811
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,279
that i noticed called cybersec 101 who

812
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,760
tried to recruit 20 different partners

813
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,000
on the relaunch of the notorious

814
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
criminal forum alpha bay which went down

815
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
in about i think

816
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
mid 2017 mid-2018

817
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
due to a law enforcement bus but it came

818
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,080
back online again anyways just last year

819
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,559
and the actors claiming to be recruiting

820
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,960
20 partners that they want to pay

821
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
5 000 a year

822
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,320
for access to this particular uh ss7

823
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
network

824
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
so there are exploits other than ss7

825
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,919
that are being that are being sold and

826
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,919
that are in demand in the underground

827
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,080
and one of those was from early 2020

828
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,399
when i found an actor nicknamed cyber

829
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,039
waffen that claimed to sell a sim swap

830
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,720
exploit on a popular underground

831
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
discussion forum and apparently this is

832
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
a social engineering exploit that

833
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,120
impacts a number of major us mobile

834
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,039
carriers

835
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,279
and the exploit supposedly not only

836
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
obtains device data but in certain cases

837
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,159
personally identifiable information

838
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,320
and that includes

839
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
the ability to obtain sms and call

840
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,679
histories location data imei numbers

841
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
mcs sim card numbers and mobile account

842
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,399
pins and scarily the actor claims as

843
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,840
well that it can obtain billing

844
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,080
addresses for the mobile account holders

845
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,919
partial credit card numbers and in some

846
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,640
cases also their social security numbers

847
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,440
but

848
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
based on my my experience in the deep

849
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,159
and dark web this particular exploit is

850
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,919
probably not legitimate they're seeking

851
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,519
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars

852
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,200
for it and usually the high price in the

853
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,799
deep and dark web like that indicates

854
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
that an actor doesn't have uh much

855
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,559
credibility because something that the

856
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,080
deep and dark web actors will do is

857
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
they'll try to raise the prices on goods

858
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,240
that really may not be worth

859
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
what they're really claiming the prices

860
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,159
are or they're claiming to sell goods

861
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,080
that really shouldn't be sold because

862
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,519
the services are too good to be true

863
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,960
so

864
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,519
exploits of bypass mfa as i was just

865
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
mentioning the promise of exploits for

866
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,000
sale to bypass mfa are an ideal

867
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,679
opportunity for act

868
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,279
criminal actors actually to prey upon

869
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,039
one another and steal each other's money

870
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,799
that does happen believe it or not

871
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
but i do think that it is highly likely

872
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,840
that actors with legitimate exploits to

873
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,559
bypass mfa are going to avoid selling

874
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,320
them because the monetary return on

875
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
investment that they can get for using

876
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,679
the exploit is much greater than if they

877
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,039
sold the exploit on a one-off basis

878
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,799
and not only that but selling exploits

879
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
will likely tip off organizations

880
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
deploying mfa

881
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,679
to the vulnerabilities in mfa

882
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,679
so i also wanted to discuss how

883
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,919
criminals are bypassing mfa to steal

884
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,480
cryptocurrencies which is something that

885
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,399
i've seen more and more of in recent

886
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,320
years

887
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,159
so these particular

888
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,880
services exploit mfa on cryptocurrency

889
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
wallets are incredibly popular in the

890
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,519
russian language underground

891
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,760
and actors providing these uh mfa

892
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
exploitation services to steal

893
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,519
cryptocurrencies they typically don't

894
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,679
provide many details around how they do

895
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,760
that which isn't surprising because if

896
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,840
they do disclose too many details then

897
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,720
the

898
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,480
uh cryptocurrency exchanges are going to

899
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
pick up on the techniques they're using

900
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
and then try to remediate those flaws

901
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,799
however

902
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
what i was able to gauge is that based

903
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,120
on these advertisements i found the

904
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,640
criminals are

905
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,960
bypassing mfa using authentication

906
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,120
applications to hack the crypto wallets

907
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,039
so um

908
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
i i highlighted a few particular

909
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,000
examples so in october 2020 i came

910
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
across an actor on one of the russian

911
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,719
underground sites i mentioned called xss

912
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,480
and their name was legion usa and they

913
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,159
claim they can remove google

914
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,918
authenticator

915
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,119
um and just completely disable mfa on

916
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,440
any cryptocurrency wallets that have mfa

917
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
enabled but for the hack to be

918
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,760
successful customers have to provide

919
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
legion usa with particular uh data they

920
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,359
have to provide the wallet log files

921
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,000
belonging to that particular uh

922
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,079
cryptocurrency wallet user along with

923
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
the data cookies

924
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,599
so the way this particular business

925
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,440
model works for this particular uh

926
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,560
individual

927
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,480
is that they'll withdraw all the funds

928
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,000
after bypassing mfa on the

929
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,159
cryptocurrency account and then they'll

930
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,520
send 75 of the the funds that were

931
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,879
withdrawn from the cryptocurrency

932
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,119
account to the customer and then legion

933
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,639
usa will actually just pocket the

934
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,879
remaining 25 percent so it's profitable

935
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,160
for for both parties involved

936
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
and they legion usa also boasts that the

937
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
success rate for hacking and withdrawing

938
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,240
funds from wallets with mfa uh

939
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,040
protecting them is 100 though i can't

940
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
validate that particular statement

941
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,880
and apparently

942
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,280
the way this particular method for

943
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
bypassing mfa in this instance works is

944
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
that the actor states that they

945
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,760
are capable of withdrawing funds from

946
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,920
api keys without necessarily having

947
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,280
withdrawal rights on those wallets

948
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
so another instance i found is that in

949
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
february 2020 i found an actor using the

950
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,839
nickname jock

951
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,119
on a russian criminal forum exploit they

952
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,200
also advertised a service for bypassing

953
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,760
mfa on digital wallets and digital

954
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,119
wallets just being those that are

955
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,040
connected to the web versus cold wallets

956
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,880
which are cryptocurrency wallets that

957
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
are hardware wallets or are not

958
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,040
connected to the web

959
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,760
so this actor this actor in particular

960
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,400
provides a little bit more detail on how

961
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
they're able to bypass multi-factor

962
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,520
authentication

963
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,920
to exploit those cryptocurrency wallets

964
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,400
they even said in their advertisement

965
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,320
that they communicate directly with the

966
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
cryptocurrency exchange technical

967
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
support teams so probably through social

968
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,800
engineering that is

969
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
the method that they use to bypass mfa

970
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
and then withdraw funds from the

971
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
cryptocurrency wallets

972
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,800
and this actor is interesting in

973
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
particular because they offer to

974
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,599
withdraw money from uh cryptocurrency

975
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,359
wallets that are the cold wall as i

976
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,880
mentioned that are not connected to the

977
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
internet and they claim to be able to

978
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
hack cold wallets that are protected by

979
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,320
sea phrases of up to 24 uh phrases or

980
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,960
freight uh sorry up to 24 words or more

981
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
so

982
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
i assess that is highly likely that as

983
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
i've mentioned before that actors are

984
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
going to avoid publicly disclosing the

985
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
methods for how they're able to bypass

986
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,040
mfa on cryptocurrency wallets so that

987
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
the methods are not burned and that they

988
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
remain effective

989
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,839
so

990
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,680
the popularity of cryptocurrencies and

991
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,920
large numbers of investors drives a high

992
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,680
demand for these particular wallet

993
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
hacking services

994
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,560
so

995
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,800
to sum everything up

996
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
as we've seen exploiting multi-factor

997
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,640
authentication is a frequent topic of

998
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
discussion among cyber criminals in the

999
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
deep and dark web

1000
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
the products and services to exploit it

1001
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,920
are in high supply and demand not

1002
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,640
surprisingly

1003
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
despite a great deal of chatter actors

1004
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,800
are reluctant to disclose too many

1005
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
details on how they are exploiting

1006
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,119
multi-factor authentication

1007
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,599
and another key takeaway is that

1008
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,760
weaknesses in mss

1009
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
sms based mfa as in the proliferation of

1010
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,480
bypassing techniques available in the

1011
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,560
underground have led for many

1012
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
organizations to try to move away from

1013
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,480
sms as a form of mfa authentication

1014
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
so

1015
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,079
and that's based on some research that

1016
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,880
um

1017
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,119
microsoft came out with in 2020 that

1018
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,640
highlighted some of these major

1019
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,920
weaknesses in sms based mfa

1020
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,359
so some of those weaknesses are that

1021
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,599
mobile carriers may transmit mfa codes

1022
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,680
in clear text and that they're easy for

1023
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,000
actors to access via social engineering

1024
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,839
or through uh

1025
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,359
interception through uh methods like ss7

1026
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,800
exploitation

1027
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,520
not only that but

1028
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,359
mobile users can also be subject to

1029
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,599
mobile carrier performance issues like

1030
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,040
uh mobile

1031
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
carrier outages and that results in

1032
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,160
delay

1033
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,240
of some of these sms codes being sent to

1034
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,799
the users

1035
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,880
so mfa tools such as authentication

1036
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
applications and hardware keys are

1037
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,800
typically considered more secure than

1038
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,359
sms and voicebase mfa

1039
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,680
but as long as as long as organizations

1040
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
continue to rely on multi-factor

1041
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,480
authentication

1042
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
actors are going to continue to try to

1043
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,680
find ways to exploit those technologies

1044
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,079
but with that being said accounts

1045
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,800
protected by any form of mfa regardless

1046
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,280
of the different type whether it be

1047
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,240
authentication apps sms voice based or a

1048
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,920
hardware key

1049
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,160
mfa is obviously going to reduce the

1050
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
risk of account takeover regardless of

1051
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
what form you're using and there are a

1052
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
number of simple actions users can take

1053
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,200
to reduce their risk of exploitation

1054
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
that includes using authentication

1055
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,560
applications and hardware keys where

1056
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,280
possible instead of sms and voice based

1057
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,960
mfa techniques

1058
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,280
um you know doing simple stuff that that

1059
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,119
many of us know about like using complex

1060
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,520
passwords in combination with mfa

1061
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
um not responding to requests like via

1062
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,760
email phishing phone calls that are

1063
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
prompting for mfa codes because those

1064
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,359
are likely going to be from malicious

1065
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,760
actors

1066
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,680
you know avoid sharing personal details

1067
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,839
online when you possibly can you know

1068
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:48,800
don't

1069
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,960
share overly much like birth dates zip

1070
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,720
codes phone numbers and social security

1071
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,400
numbers and keeping that type of

1072
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,240
information private whenever you can on

1073
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,599
the web

1074
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,440
to reduce the risk of phishing social

1075
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,599
engineering and sim swapping attacks

1076
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,520
use pins on mobile carrier accounts and

1077
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,359
try to remain vigilant of network

1078
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,520
connectivity issues that may indicate

1079
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,680
sim swapping um and also if you can try

1080
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,520
to avoid associating phone numbers with

1081
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,040
important online accounts wherever

1082
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
possible because that will obviously

1083
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
reduce the risk of the mitigate damage

1084
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,359
if you ever fall victim to sim swapping

1085
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,480
so

1086
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,620
thank you thank you all for attending

1087
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,388
[Applause]
