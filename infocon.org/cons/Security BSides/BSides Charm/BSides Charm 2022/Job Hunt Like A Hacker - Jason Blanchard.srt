1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,560

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,840
blanchard it's five o'clock so i'm gonna

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,039
get started

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,880
i'm going to stay to the podium and this

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
hurts me i have a hard time just

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
standing still so i'm going to do the

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
best i can my name is jason blanchard

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,000
like i said and since

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,520
2020 well it's weird to say it like that

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,320
since 2020 of march when the pandemic

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
started i started a live stream on

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,399
twitch where i helped people job hunt

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,719
since then 207 people have found jobs

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
and i got really good at it

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
and helping 207 people find jobs spent i

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,879
had to figure out how to help 207 people

17
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
find jobs which meant i got really

18
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
really good at helping people find jobs

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
so if i ever need a job i'm good

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
i'm good okay so what i'm going to do

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,760
today is just give you a real quick

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
crash course 30 minute style and like

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
how to job hunt like a hacker

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,520
some of the people earlier today who

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,000
came to the hiring village and said hi

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
to me i see some of you here so welcome

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,439
back it's good to see you and i'm going

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,200
to try to cover all the most pertinent

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,720
information in 30 minutes because this

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
is 11 hours of content in 30 minutes

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
so if you ever want to see the other 10

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,720
hours 10 and a half hours it's on

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,840
youtube

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,439
just do a search for jason blanchard and

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
have a job hunt like a hacker all right

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
so i know you can't see this very well

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,320
and that's okay because i'm going to

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
describe it as well as i can if you want

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,479
to get closer feel free to do so but

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
what we have here is linkedin

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
prior to march 2020 linkedin was like

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,399
okay you know i checked and

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,159
some people checked linkedin like oh

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,000
that's right i have a linkedin profile

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
you know like you barely remembered your

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
linkedin profile but all of a sudden on

47
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
like march 2020 when they laid off you

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,040
know

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,119
hundreds and thousands of people then

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:05,920
people

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,800
really found linkedin and so during that

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
period of time people like took it more

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
seriously they built their linkedins and

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,000
stuff and if you're like why does this

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
have anything to do with job hunting

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,080
like a hacker i will get there okay

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
so linkedin became like the thing that

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,599
people went to and so since it's the

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,120
thing that people go to ha ha

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,080
that's fine all right

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,400
that's fine

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
i'm hot spotting if anyone else is using

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720

okay

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
okay so there's a bunch of things that

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
you can do to your linkedin profile but

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
let's get into like how to actually

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
build a resume what i'm going to do

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,920
right now is go to this page right here

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,519
and i'm going to see the most important

78
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
thing i'm going to see today and it's

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
this

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
all right i'm going to type it real big

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,879
okay so here we go

82
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,319
i'm gonna type it on the screen because

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
i'm i'm used to being a live streamer

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
and i'm not used to seeing the humans

85
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,799
watching me do this so here we go

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,080
humans

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
there we go suck

88
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,879
at

89
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
describing

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,159
that's fine themselves

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
they are much

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
better at finding something that

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
describes

94
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
themselves

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
so i don't know about you but if you've

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
ever if someone's like hey now that

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
you've been unemployed why don't you

98
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,480
just build a resume if anyone ever uses

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
the words just when they ask you to do

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
something it means they have no idea how

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
hard it is to do the thing that they've

102
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
just asked you to do they're like just

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,599
make a resume and you're like

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,478
okay

105
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,440
so

106
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,279
this is typically what human beings

107
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
would do you're unemployed and since

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
you're unemployed you're

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,919
upset and since you're upset that's the

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,160
best time to ever write a resume and so

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
you're sitting here looking at a blank

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
sheet of paper and all of a sudden you

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
have to

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
figure out a way to describe who you are

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
in a way that gets you a job that will

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
feed you

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
and house you

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
and make sure that you don't die or

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
something like you it's healthcare and

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
all these like and so you're like

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,280
and then it falls apart from there

122
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,840
and at this point you're like uh

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,198
do i put my phone

124
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,199
maybe do i put an email

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,320
i think

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
what about a link linkedin what about my

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,479
linkedin account

128
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,639
all right so at this point and then you

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919
start like should it should i make this

130
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
bold and like this is what you

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
accomplish on day one

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,919
and at this point you like fall apart

133
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,600
you're like

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
that was enough today and so the next

135
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
day you have to then give yourself a

136
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
title and it might be do i put aspiring

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
do i like it's always a question like

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
aspiring junior

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,600
sock analyst

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,080
pen tester like at this point you don't

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
know what to put i don't know does this

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
happen to anybody you just like you look

143
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
at this okay okay all right

144
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
and and then you're like do i put in

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
about me section to put an executive

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
summary do i put this do i put that what

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,000
do i put here i don't know how to

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,919
describe myself this sucks i hate all of

149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
us and then it's like well what skills

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,759
do i have do i have like bow hunting

151
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
skills do i have like you know liger

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
drawing skills

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
and so if you've ever looked at a blank

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
page and tried to figure out what the

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,600
heck to put on this i get it it sucks

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
now the other way you could do this is

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,039
go to

158
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,639
your document

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,160
and then they're like would you like to

160
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
make a like a template let's go from a

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,440
template gallery and you're like okay

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,759
i don't know about you but a template is

163
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
only as good until you actually use it

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,199
the moment you put words in a template

165
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,000
the whole thing falls apart so here i

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,840
look all right

167
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960

168
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
blanchard

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
crap

170
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,960
now what do i put my address do i put my

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,759
phone

172
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
and then look at this part for skills

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,160
how many of you can put all your skills

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
you have in this section

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
that makes no sense and then you get

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
down here and it says three companies

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,479
and some of you are like i haven't

178
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
worked at three companies i'm getting

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
ready to graduate i'm getting ready to

180
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
do this well i worked at the same

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
company for 15 years do i put the

182
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,599
company that i worked at 15 years ago

183
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
like before like does that make any

184
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,520
sense and then i only get room for two

185
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
bullet points

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
15 years two bullet points and then like

187
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
this other company helped out for six

188
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,319
months also two bullet points like it

189
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,720
doesn't make any sense to do a template

190
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
like this and then school education

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,120
where do i put my search awards i never

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
got an award

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,639
oh god i never got an award so i don't

194
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
know about you

195
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
but that part sucks too

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
so

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,479
i get back over here and i'm like well

198
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,199
how do i build a resume like how do i do

199
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
this and so it was about three months

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,919
into the live stream when all of a

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,599
sudden i was helping someone with a job

202
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
hunt and it was like oh

203
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
damn it i wish i would have known this

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
three months ago i would have helped a

205
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
lot of other people so here's what you

206
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
do here's how to build a here's how to

207
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,039
build a resume here's how to put this

208
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,680
together so what you do is do a search

209
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,919
for the job that you want

210
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,360
you do a search for the job that you

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
want so if you want to be a stock

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
analyst i'm not saying you do you go

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,919
over here to sock analyst and then you

214
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
click on jobs the reason why i use

215
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
linkedin is because i like linkedin

216
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,039
because everything's in linkedin the

217
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,240
jobs are in linkedin the people are in

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,599
linkedin the recruiters are in linkedin

219
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,800
everyone's on linkedin glassdoor

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
monster i don't care like linkedin is

221
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
just the place that i like to go so if i

222
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
go here to sock analyst and then it's

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
the united states and i hit refresh

224
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
because for some reason it never comes

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,840
up with all the jobs available there are

226
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,639
currently 17 020 jobs available in the

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
united states for stock analyst now

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,120
those of you who have been job hunting

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
or you will job hunt

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
how many of you have gone to the like

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
you look for entry-level jobs and then

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
you just get pissed off

233
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
like you entry-level stock analyst jobs

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
and then like immediately like i hate

235
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,720
this all right so instead of doing that

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,080
there's a simple little trick where you

237
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
just type in the words minus senior

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
and minus sr that's the abbreviation for

239
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,600
senior and senior as soon as you do that

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,680
and then you hit search it will get rid

241
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,399
of all the senior level jobs and senior

242
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
jobs and so what you're left with is 12

243
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
492 stock jobs available in the united

244
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
states the reason why you don't do a

245
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
search here if i go over here to filters

246
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
and it's like i'm looking for an

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
internship where i'm looking for entry

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
level never ever ever ever ever ever

249
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
ever ever ever ever ever ever ever click

250
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
these buttons and the reason why is

251
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
because the person who uploaded it

252
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
didn't care enough to click the right

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
button

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
they didn't

255
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
why would they want to limit the amount

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
of people who see

257
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
the job posting and the way that they

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
do their job is the more people who see

259
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
it then people fill those positions and

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
so why would they want to limit the

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
amount of people who see their job

262
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,959
postings so they don't care enough to

263
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
click the right button and so if you're

264
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
like really yes really

265
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
so don't ever ever ever ever ever click

266
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
these just put in mind a senior minus

267
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
ssr and then if you want to get a job uh

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
up here do a search for the past week

269
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
past week not

270
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,200
all time not last 24 hours just the past

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,240
week

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
and then if you want to know why you can

273
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,680
come up to talk to me later on because i

274
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
don't have the time and if you want to

275
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,279
work remotely then you click the remote

276
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,680
button and then you hit search all right

277
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
so there were 642 results of remote

278
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
stock analyst work that are not senior

279
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,560
level jobs in the united states posted

280
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
in the last week that you can apply for

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,000

282

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
and then if i go over here i see two

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,519
applicants three days ago

286
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,279
something describes themselves as this

322
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,279
don't say no on behalf of

323

that you will come across a job

325
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720

oh that looks like a really awesome job

333
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
but it's a microsoft and they would

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
never hire someone like me

335
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
like i don't know about you but the

336
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
problem with job hunting is that your

337
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,639
self-confidence sucks and your

338
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,360
self-doubt is super through the roof and

339
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
that's not the like time to make

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,399
decisions

341
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,480
especially for somebody else and so

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,399
whenever you're job hunting if you see

343
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
something that you want please don't say

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
no on behalf of somebody else at least

345
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
apply and let them say no on

346
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
behalf of themselves instead of you

347
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
saying no on behalf of them that make

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,519
sense

349
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,880
so if you're job hunting and all of a

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,160
sudden you come across something you're

351
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
like that looks really cool i will apply

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
for it

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
and they may say no

354
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
but let them say no okay so now that

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
you've found this job over here and

356
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
you're like oh look at all this stuff

357
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,680
that i should be able to know but i

358
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
don't know all those things i wish i

359
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,920
knew all those things well let's stop

360
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
let's stop let's stop job hunting for a

361
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
second and let's put your resume

362
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,360
together so what i want to talk about

363
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
right now is called a catch-all resume

364
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
a catch-all resume and it's just a term

365
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
that i call that i didn't know what else

366
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,360
to call it so i called it a catch-all

367
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
resume and here's what it is

368
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
it's you

369
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
scrolling through every linkedin job

370
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
post you can possibly find and then just

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,320
harvest anything that is true about you

372
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
as you scroll through linkedin and you

373
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,720
go from job post to job post you just

374
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
harvest every bullet point you find that

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
is true about you so what that looks

376
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
like is we're over here right now

377
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,240
looking at past week remote jobs you

378
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
know senior minus

379
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,760
sorry don't do that we're just going to

380
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
go over here and say anytime and we're

381
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
going to say any job

382
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
all right so we're going to say any job

383
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,639
so

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
what this looks like is

385
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,360
i'm going to look at all 12

386
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,279
471 jobs that are not senior level stock

387
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,560
analyst jobs

388
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,079
i'm going to click on the first one here

389
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,920
and as i scroll through and it says

390
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
review i'm going to

391
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
zoom in a little bit

392
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
review and develop metrics related to

393
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
the operation and maturity of the jsp

394
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,560
sock now you would just remove jsp

395
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,519
because i don't know what the heck that

396
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,360
stands for but it would say something

397
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,440
like review and develop metrics related

398
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
to the operation mature maturation

399
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,199
of the sock

400
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,199
if this is a true thing about you then

401
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,600
copy it you copy it you go over to a

402
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
brand new sheet

403
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,800
you then hit

404
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
new document and then you paste it

405
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
any true bullet point about you becomes

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,360
something that you harvest from job

407
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,199
descriptions

408
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,760
which were written by hr professionals

409
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
and recruiters so it's written in this

410
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
knowledge and speak that they speak to

411
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
each other and so if you like work with

412
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,079
large cyber security operations data

413
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,920
sense and implement error checking data

414
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
quality assessments and queries if this

415
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,839
is a true thing about you then you would

416
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,000
copy this and then you'd go over to your

417
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
document

418
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,279
and then you paste it for some reason i

419
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
don't know why both bullet points aren't

420
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
in the same damn place but for some

421
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,440
reason it isn't and that's fine okay

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
so if it's true about you here's the

423
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
thing about this i would never in a

424
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
million years sit down at a blank sheet

425
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,320
of paper and say

426
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
what is true about me

427
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
you know what i work with large cyber

428
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
security operations data sets and

429
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
implement error checking data quality

430
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
assessments and queries

431
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,959
i just wouldn't

432
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
i wouldn't

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
and so when you go through and you

434
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,519
harvest the bullet points that are true

435
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,199
about you they're true you just found

436
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,079
them it's like all right i'm a virgo

437
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
so i'm just going to type in virgo up

438
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,360
here and then i'm going to go over here

439
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,140
to images and then

440
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,480
[Music]

441
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,959
let's click on this one

442
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
i don't know what that is

443
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,079
natural born detectives

444
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
always give people the benefit of the

445
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
doubt tends to suffer in silence and

446
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
keep to themselves

447
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
we'll always have your back does not

448
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,959
like to be told what to do super high

449
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,320
standards

450
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
nailed it

451
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,160
nailed it

452
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,440
so

453
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,839
when it comes to job hunting i would

454
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,839
never sit down and say now you're born

455
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,680
detective

456
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,079
i always give people the it's true but i

457
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
would never write it and so when i went

458
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,600
through and harvested every single

459
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
bullet point i could find about me

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
through job descriptions of things that

461
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,000
i'm capable of i found things like this

462
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
strong analytical chops able to still it

463
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
all down for your grandma

464
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
i don't know what that means but i was

465
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,959
like sure it makes sense adapted

466
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
simplifying communicating complex ideas

467
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,839
to broad audiences

468
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
nailed it i like this one i found it on

469
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,359
the job description that says i have big

470
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,958
ideas and big ambitions

471
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,520
true but if i was sitting down to a

472
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,199
blank sheet of paper i would have never

473
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
written that

474
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,400
i would have never thought to write i

475
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,199
have big ideas and big ambitions

476
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
one of my favorites is mainly sedentary

477
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,640
in an offensive environment

478
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,080
yeah

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
accurate

480
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,520
now one of the other things that i do

481
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
recommend is there are two types of job

482
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
description there's the narrative

483
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
job description or the narrative resume

484
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
that says here's who i am as a human

485
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
being right because as a human being i

486
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
can accomplish anything that you ask me

487
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
to do

488
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
but then i have skills so there's the

489
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,280
narrative here's who i am as a human but

490
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,559
then there's also the skills and

491
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
abilities that i have so i have this

492
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
section that's called who am i and

493
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
that's where i find any of the things

494
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
like excellent excellent critical

495
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
thinking and passion for creative

496
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
problem solving like

497
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,679
sure okay but then when you get actually

498
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,000
down to the skills where it says manage

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
client customers brands internal

you know change some of the tents change

519
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,720
some of the wording around to make sure

520
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,559
that it's you not like the job

521
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,120
description part but that's you that's

522
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
the job that you're doing like you don't

523
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,799
have to like fill in the blank and then

524
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
eight years goes by and then all of a

525
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,080
sudden you have to job hunt again you're

526
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,840
like oh what do i do at my job

527
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,760
i can't think of it

528
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,840
i can't think of what i do all day and

529
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
so i uh i used to work at sands my old

530
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,840
boss is out there right now we're right

531
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
across from each other it's not weird

532
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,880
and so

533
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,240
we have

534
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,559
sans marketing where i just went in and

535
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,000
i found the job description and i was

536
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
like yep

537
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
that's what i did

538
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
those are the things i did and i just

539
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
harvested my old job description and

540
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
then i made it 100 true about me because

541
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
how many of you have ever gotten a job

542
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,799
and then you start doing the job and

543
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
you're like that's not what the job

544
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
description said

545
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
that's fine it's a little different now

546
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,799
you have that little part at the bottom

547
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
says duties as assigned

548
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,000
you got me

549
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
you got me

550
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,880
all right so

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
now that you have this okay so all of

552
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,159
you here you will then you know take two

553
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,760
hours of your time set a timer because

554
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,039
if not you'll get

555
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,720
like super distracted like i'm starting

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
to apply for jobs no that's not what

557
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
this time is for you just take two hours

558
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
and you go through and you harvest all

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
the bullet points you can find that are

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,679
true about you make sure that in the

561
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,080
proper tense before

562
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,200
all

563
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,320
job

564
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,600
resumes should have each bullet point

565
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,760
start with an action verb in the proper

566
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
tense hopefully that just made sense

567
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,919
when you build out a resume the first

568
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,000
word in your

569
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,080
here's what i can do is an action verb

570
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
in the proper tense so if it's something

571
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
you're doing it's in the present tense

572
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,880
if it's something that you did it's in

573
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
the past tense

574
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,159
and if you don't know what action verbs

575
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,120
are

576
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
that's fine i had to look it up too uh

577
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,480
185 action verbs

578
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
for job hunting

579
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,159
so 185 action verbs that will make your

580
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,520
resume shine

581
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,400

plan produce and program so you want to

587
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720

588
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
of each and every bullet point of here's

589

you'll see that you know i have i could

603
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,960
create experience one more thing

604
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
experience is not what you got paid to

605
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
do

606
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
i want to be very clear before i move on

607
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
experience is not what you got paid to

608
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
do experience is experience

609
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,159
if you have hacked the box or if you

610
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,840
have a home lab or if you have things

611
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,760
that you do you can put it in the

612
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,320
experience section if you're a volunteer

613
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
somewhere you can put it in the

614
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
experience section experience is

615
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
experience it's not because you got paid

616
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,120
or told what to do

617
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
so make sure that you're not like

618
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
neglecting things that you've done

619
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
because someone didn't pay you to do

620
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,039
them all right so if i go down here let

621
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
me show you what the finished the turkey

622
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
looks like after i've cooked it for five

623
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,600
and a half hours

624
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,919
is that it looks like this

625
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
do you see that each section starts with

626
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,840
a bullet point please for the love of

627
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
god put bullet points in your linkedin

628
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
profile the reason why is because human

629
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,600
beings are okay with bullet points they

630
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
if they see a big block of text they're

631
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
like no

632
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
i will not read

633
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,080
so if you have bullet points here the

634
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,720
human goes i'll read a couple so

635
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,000
produced creative valuable created led

636
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
developed oversaw engaged attended do

637
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,120
you know why there's spaces in between

638
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
just to make it easy for you to read

639
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
that's it there's spaces in between to

640
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
make it easy for you read because here's

641
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,799
here's how human beings have become over

642
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
the last couple years we like tweets and

643
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
facebook posts tweets and facebook posts

644
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,280
and so this is like tweet tweet tweet

645
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,039
tweet tweet tweet 280 characters don't

646
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
go over that all right then down here i

647
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
got some stuff i you know added anyway

648
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
so

649
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,600
why is this important

650
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
because you're going to apply for jobs

651
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000

652
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200

653
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200

665
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,880
there's six of them

666
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
hi kelly peter

667
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,320
dixon

668
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
lishba

669
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
i think

670
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,799
what you could do is here is a

671
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
university recruiter at fireeye if any

672
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,720
of you right now are in college you

673
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
could essentially reach out to kelly

674
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,320
here on linkedin

675
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,000
and she has her messages locked

676
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
doesn't mean you can't send a message

677
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,039
you totally can if you have a premium

678
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,400
linkedin account you can send a message

679
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
to anybody in linkedin world you can do

680
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
that but here's the work around to that

681
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,159
is if you look at someone's activity

682
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,600
feed on linkedin

683
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
and you see if they have anything kelly

684
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
doesn't use linkedin so we're gonna move

685
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,760
on from kelly kelly was a terrible

686
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,799
example

687
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
all right so let's go over here to

688
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
microsoft

689
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,320
okay

690
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
thank you thank you thank you all right

691
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,880
so we get a microsoft and then that's a

692
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
computer company apparently and then if

693
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
you go over here to people and then we

694
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,080
type in recruiter they got 225 000

695
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,919
people that work there

696
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,360
and there we go i'm going to increase my

697
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,480
odds alright so we have 2 000

698
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
493 magical job fairies

699
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,559
that work here

700
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,039
we got jessica global talent acquisition

701
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,880
recruiter we got a senior talent source

702
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
or recruiter at microsoft we got a

703
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,320
recruiter here jamal let's go ahead and

704
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,360
click here messages locked that's fine

705
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
that's okay i know boo thank you all

706
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
right so we go down here to look at his

707
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
activity

708
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,640
nailed it all right good so as a five

709
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,799
days ago if you ever see a linkedin

710
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,000
profile it will show you the post date

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
so this was posted five days ago but

712
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
jamal interacted with if you didn't know

713
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,120
linkedin is the world's biggest

714
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,039
tattletale on social media they will

715
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,400
tell you exactly what you've been doing

716
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,159
what you commented on what's shared what

717
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,760
all that stuff and so i scrolled down

718
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,440
through here and i see that jamal's used

719
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,039
like two weeks ago well who's this

720
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,760
person i started doing some crazy oceans

721
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
on recruiters i will find out everything

722
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,120
about them i will

723
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
just send that letter

724
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
okay so when you look through here

725
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,440
sometimes what you'll find is they'll

726
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,919
actually post jobs or they'll post

727
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
friends or they'll post this or they'll

728
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,320
post that now whenever they post a job

729
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,919
one of the things that you can do is add

730
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
on to the message like hey i see that

731
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
you posted this job for such and such

732
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,760
position would it be possible to reach

733
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,279
out and talk to you for 10 to 15 minutes

734
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,039
to find out more about the role and to

735
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,840
introduce myself to the

736
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,520
company you can totally do that and what

737
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
this recruiter is going to do in

738
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
response is like

739
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,360
who are you

740
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,360
yes

741
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
and they will click on your profile and

742
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,760
you've just fleshed it out you made it

743
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,600
look nice you filled in all those

744
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
different categories of all the things

745
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
that you can do because you harvested

746
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
from other bullet points and when

747
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,120
someone gets to your profile they're

748
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
like solid

749
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
that looks good in fact we're hiring for

750
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
a position very similar to that

751
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,120
i have seen this

752
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,520
i have seen this work at least 207 times

753
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,080
the main takeaways from today is this

754
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
resumes suck that's the main takeaway

755
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,200
but the thing is that we suck at

756
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,799
describing ourselves we're much better

757
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,840
finding something to describe to

758
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
ourselves so go harvest every single job

759
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
description you can possibly find to

760
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,919
find things that are true about you this

761
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,919
includes the job that you want and jobs

762
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,159
that you've had in the past because you

763
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,600
can go through and find jobs you've had

764
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
in the past and and really fill out all

765
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,000
the things that you're capable of once

766
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
you do that then fill out your linkedin

767
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,120
profile and then after that anywhere

768
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
that you want to work you find a job

769
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
description that you want to apply for

770
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
you will then apply for that job and

771
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,559
then find the recruiters at that company

772
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,919
to introduce yourself to and then say hi

773
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,279
my name is

774
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
would it be possible to talk about this

775
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,559
job for a few minutes

776
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,720
and not every one of them will respond

777
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,559
that is not what this is about

778
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
but don't say no on behalf of somebody

779
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,559
else when you reach out to that person

780
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,240
you are not expecting a response in

781
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
return but do not

782
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,200
say no on behalf of them send the

783
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
message and let them say no but

784
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
sometimes they say yes and that's how

785
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,600
you get your next job and that's it

786
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,740
all right

787
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,980
[Applause]
