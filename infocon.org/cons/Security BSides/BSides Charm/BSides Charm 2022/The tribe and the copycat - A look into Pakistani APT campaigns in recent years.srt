00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
and then we can have a discussion or any

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800

um so today i'm gonna be presenting

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,840
on the tribe and the copycat

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
we're going to be taking a look into

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
pakistani apt campaigns in recent years

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
specifically from 2020 into 2021 and

19
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,600
then 2022.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
before we start for those of you that

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
don't know me my name is ashir malhotra

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,479
i'm a threat researcher at cisco talos i

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
specialize in malware analysis reverse

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,360
engineering and threat intelligence

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,600
these days i work on a variety of apt

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
disclosures

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
everything i track everyone from the

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,479
north koreans to the chinese to the

29
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
pakistanis

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,560
i am located in maryland out of the

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
fulton maryland office that is where we

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
the headquarters for cisco talos is

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
all right so on today's agenda we're

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,759
going to go through an introduction i'm

35
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,040
going to tell you a little bit about

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,799
pakistani hacking operations that are

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,720
state-sponsored we're going to take a

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,360
look at two key apt groups here

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,920
transparent tribe and side copy and then

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
i'm going to summarize by talking about

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,840
the similarities and the differences

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
between these two groups

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
so before we begin

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
by a show of hands how many of you know

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,719
what an apt is an advanced persistent

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,119
thread all right that's pretty cool so

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
for those of us that don't know

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
an advanced persistent threat is a

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
threat actor or a hacking group that is

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
usually affiliated with the government

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,480
you know they're sponsored by a

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
government in some some some form or the

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,040
other and they do the bidding of the

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,280
nation state in one form or the other

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
um

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,160
it's it's debatable whether they're

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
advanced or not there are certain apts

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
that are not really advanced they're

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
just regular hacking groups and some of

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
them are really really advanced so

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,760
um we'll see that um the pakistani apd

62
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,040
groups that i'm going to be discussing

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
here today they're not really advanced

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
they're kind of sort of like tier 3 apd

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
groups

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
so yeah let's begin

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,959
pakistani nation state operations have

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
been active since at least 2015 and 16.

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,200
they were first disclosed by proof point

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
in 2016

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
as part of a report called operation c

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
major

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,920
their operations consist of two key apt

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
groups one of them is transparent drive

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
and the other one is side copy

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
so the leopard on the screen represents

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,000
transparent tri because they're also

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
called mythic leopard

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
and then the side copy this two

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
computers representing side copy because

81
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
we're just trying to show that they copy

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
so

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
transparent tribe is the og apd group

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
they are the ones that started

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
operations for pakistan for the

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,799
pakistani government in 2016

87
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
and they have not lost momentum since

88
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
then like we see a new campaign every

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
every three or four months operated by

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
transparent tribe ever since 2016. so

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,799
they've really upped their game since

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
you know 2016 in the past six years or

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
so

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
side copy is the new kid on the block we

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
first found them in operating in 2019

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,159
um they started uh proliferating

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
themselves and their infection chains in

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,680
2020

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,040
uh their targeting absolutely exploded

100
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
in 2021 and they continue to do so in

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,400
2022 as well

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
now

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
the the thing about the most interesting

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
thing about both of these groups is that

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
you know i spoke about advanced in

106
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,959
advance persistent threat they're not

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
really advanced and you know we look at

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
their implants a little bit and we'll

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,839
look at their infection chains

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,680
but they're not they don't really run

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
cutting edge operations um

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,520
you know in spite of transparent tribe

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
being operational for like seven six or

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680
seven years now they still want to do

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
what what works best you know they don't

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
want to put a lot of effort and you know

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
infect targets at the same time which is

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,000
why i feel that they are a tier 3 apt

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
now what they lack for in technical

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
skills they make up for in motivation

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,120
and perseverance they are extremely

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
aggressive when they try to

123
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
infect their users and their targets and

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,040
i'll show you some examples of that

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,199
since these are pakistani groups they

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
have a very special interest in india

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
and afghanistan

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
and pakistan we've seen them deployed

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,880
target

130
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
malware against targets that

131
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,720
that are domestic targets as well you

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,759
know for domestic surveillance as well

133
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,960
all right let's take a look at

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
transparent drive now

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
transparent tribe has been extremely

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
prolific they're extremely aggressive

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
when they try to infect their targets uh

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,280
over the few years you know that they've

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
been operating they have had a great

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
degree of success with very little

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
technical

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
expertise if i may say

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,440
they have a very special interest in

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
india and afghanistan as i said

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,280
they try to go after

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,199
military diplomatic

147
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,759
entities in in these two geographies

148
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
in pakistan we've seen sporadic

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
instances of individuals being targeted

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
that are

151
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
more related to um you know human rights

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,039
activists and stuff like that

153
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
humanitarian the the individuals that

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
are performing humanitarian efforts

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,919
now a transparent tribe likes to use two

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
key malware families one of them is

157
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
called crimson rat and they absolutely

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
love this malware family this is their

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,319
go-to malware family

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,440
it's a c sharp based net based custom uh

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,199
remote access trojan

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
uh with a wide variety of capabilities

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
uh these days they don't put a lot of

164
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,759
effort into putting in features into the

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
rat family because you know it's already

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,840
packed with so many features so these

167
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
days they just put an effort to

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
obfuscate the rat family so that

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
analysis and identification becomes

170
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
difficult for them

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
so about an about 95 of their infection

172
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
chains 95 percent of their targeting

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,440
results in an infection with crimson rat

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
other than crimson rat we've also seen

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
oblique rat

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
this is a sea based uh remote access

177
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
trojan that was disclosed by talos in

178
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,759
2020 it's still evolving every every

179
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
every every quarter or so we see an

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,599
addition of like a couple of features

181
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
into this rat family

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
uh the thing about this rat is that it's

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
it's used in highly targeted attacks

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
they will use it they will use the strat

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,759
family very very judiciously uh it's not

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
like crimson rat they will

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
they won't just willy nilly distribute

188
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
it they know exactly what they want they

189
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,720
they know exactly who they want to

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
infect and then they'll deploy oblique

191
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,479
rat against the targets

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,000
all right so let's take a look at the

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
hosting infrastructure so

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,599
the hosting infrastructure for

195
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,680
transparent tribe is interesting because

196
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
they have a two-pronged approach

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
the first approach that they have is

198
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
that they will register fake domains

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,479
that masquerade as those of legitimate

200
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
entities so they'll pick up a defense

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,080
contractor um you know they'll

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
create a typo squatted domain for the

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
defense contractor that operates out of

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
india or afghanistan and they will clone

205
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,319
the entire website of that contractor

206
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
for example and then they will host that

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
website on their domain and they will

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
also use that website for hosting

209
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,879
malicious artifacts that participate in

210
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,879
their infection chains

211
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
i'll show you an example of this in the

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,479
next slide as well uh the second

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,039
approach that transparent tribe loves to

214
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
take is that they use media and file

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
sharing websites you know these are

216
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,000
websites that masquerade or look like um

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
cms websites something like dropbox or

218
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
like onedrive or you know

219
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,199
something else

220
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,280
and a good example of that is a domain

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,360
like dropbox.cc it looks like

222
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
dropbox.com but it's not it's actually

223
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,360
operated by these attackers and they use

224
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
it to host malicious artifacts on there

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,120
all right let's go through a few

226
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,960
examples so

227
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
i've got three examples on the screen

228
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,080
here of fake domains that they've

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,120
created

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
uh they like to create fake domains for

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,958
a variety of um

232
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,799
you know for a variety of their targets

233
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,399
and and entities that they try to

234
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,800
impersonate we've seen uh fake domains

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
and websites being created

236
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
sorry

237
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
for defense contractors and think tanks

238
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
and even government themes team themed

239
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
websites uh the first two screenshots

240
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
that i have on the screen are basically

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
it's a it's it's taken from a website

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,000
that they operated uh and they basically

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
cloned a legitimate website called with

244
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
a tool called hd track

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
and they set it up so if you open up the

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
the fake website in the browser it looks

247
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,959
legit

248
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,080
um

249
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
the second screenshot the one in the

250
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
blue the one with the taj mahal in the

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
in the back

252
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
uh this is a fake website that they set

253
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
up

254
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
for the employees of the government of

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,360
india and it the download now button

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
basically downloads a malicious xls file

257
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
and an excel sheet and you when you open

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
it up it gives you a bunch of data about

259
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
the different page pay grades in the

260
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
indian government

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
but it also ends up infecting you with

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
crimson rat so

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
all right let's take a look at the lures

264
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
and targeting now um

265
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,399
we've seen a variety of lures and a

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
variety of themes being used against the

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,959
malicious documents that a transparent

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,480
tribe aims to distribute against their

269
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
targets we've seen this defense themed

270
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
malicious documents we've seen them

271
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
targeting conference attendees we've

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
seen diplomatic themes and we've even

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
seen honey traps as well

274
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,880
in terms of defense themed uh documents

275
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,839
um

276
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
so i've got i've got an interesting

277
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
example here

278
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
this is an email a phishing email that

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,839
consisted of a malicious document this

280
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,160
this malicious document basically

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
contains malicious macros that in turn

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
deploy crimson rat onto the infected

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,519
endpoint

284
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
this exact email was sent out by the

285
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
attackers to

286
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
defense advisors stationed in indian

287
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
embassies in southeast asia so you know

288
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
it looks very very innocent it looks

289
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
very benign

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760
you you can't figure out what's going on

291
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
or whether this is malicious or not just

292
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,440
by looking at the email and then when

293
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
you open up the document um you know you

294
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
end up getting infected with their

295
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
implant

296
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
in terms of conference attendees they

297
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,079
like to target people like you and me

298
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,959
you know

299
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,320
people who attend different types of

300
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,279
conferences especially trade conferences

301
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
defense related conferences and even

302
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,079
humanitarian conferences we've seen an

303
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
extensive targeting of humanitarian

304
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
conferences in afghanistan

305
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
especially before you know the taliban

306
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,560
took over the country by a transparent

307
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,480
tribe

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
the screenshot that i have on the screen

309
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
is an example of a malicious powerpoint

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
presentation

311
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,640
uh that was created by the attackers and

312
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
distributed to attendees of the

313
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
conference known as indie sem 2021 this

314
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
is a conference that is owned and

315
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,200
operated by the indian air force

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
uh for those of you that that are

317
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,040
wondering uh that's the sukhoi 30 that's

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
draped in the indian flag so you know

319
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
they try to make it look as legitimate

320
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
as possible you know their their content

321
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,200
and their layers

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
okay so in terms of diplomatic themes uh

323
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
we've seen an extensive targeting of

324
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,440
indian

325
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
and you know afghani uh agencies

326
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
but what's um what's also interesting is

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
that we've seen non-indian diplomatic

328
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
agencies being targeted as well

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
for example in in 2020 um in august 2020

330
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
in september 2020 the attackers sent

331
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
the sent employees of the british high

332
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
commission in in pakistan a malicious

333
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
archive that consisted of

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,600
a ton of copies of crimson rat so you

335
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
know you just have to click any one of

336
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
them and you'll get infected by them and

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,519
that's the first screenshot on the

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,480
screen

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120
we've also seen sporadic targeting of

340
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
agencies located out of iran

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
the islamic republic of iran but these

342
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
are one-off cases primarily their targe

343
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
their targeting is focused towards india

344
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,599
and afghanistan

345
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,279
okay honey traps so transparent tribe

346
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,360
loves to use honey traps this is a

347
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
direct translation of spying and

348
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
espionage operations from their

349
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,040
intelligence services into the cyber

350
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,000
rail

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,480
usually they will send you files that

352
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
have icons with alluring or enticing

353
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
photos of women and they will ask you to

354
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,440
click on them and you know you get you

355
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
end up getting infected by them

356
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,480
um they also love to send people you

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
know to send targets copies of resumes

358
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,279
of women so that people end up opening

359
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
them and they get infected by malware as

360
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
well um

361
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,639
this is this is a favorite technique of

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
that there's like they love doing this

363
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000
and we we

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
and incidentally side copy also loves

365
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,839
doing this they will contact their

366
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
targets through social media websites

367
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
like facebook and talk to them establish

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
trust and then end up sending them like

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
a resume or a file that says hey these

370
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,279
are my pictures you want to take a look

371
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,720
at them and then you know people end up

372
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,839
getting infected by

373
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,360
them okay so let's talk about

374
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
transparent tribes latest campaign this

375
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
was disclosed um

376
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
i think this month to last month

377
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,920
uh by cisco um in this specific campaign

378
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
we saw a shift in the way the the apt

379
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,279
group operates

380
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,000
usually and by far about in 90 percent

381
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,279
of the cases

382
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,760
transparent tribe will use malicious

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
documents that act as entry vectors into

384
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,760
their infection chains

385
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,040
in these cases however we saw the group

386
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
use fake installers that were disguised

387
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,079
uh as installers for applications that

388
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
are used by the government of india and

389
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
employees of the government of india so

390
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
you see that you see the the screenshot

391
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
in white that says coverage

392
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,320
authentication uh coverage is a

393
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
two-factor authentication software that

394
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,959
is created by the government of india

395
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,240
and it is used by the government of

396
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
india's employees to you know login into

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,760
their emails and their internets and

398
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,800
such

399
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,199
so the way this infection chain works is

400
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
that you get the fake installer you

401
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
execute it and it downloads and executes

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
crimson right onto your system and then

403
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
at the same time it downloads a

404
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,839
legitimate copy of the the you know the

405
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,839
application that it's masquerading as

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,279
and then sets it up on the system as

407
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,240
well

408
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
um in this specific campaign uh we saw

409
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,800
the use of a new lightweight.net based

410
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
uh implant as well and i call it

411
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
lightning lightweight simply because it

412
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,079
doesn't have as many capabilities as

413
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
crimson rad because crimson rat is

414
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
packed with capabilities

415
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
uh so

416
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
honestly i feel that the attackers are

417
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
now trying to refresh you know their

418
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,600
infection chains they're also moving to

419
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
a use and throw tactic where they will

420
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
use a new lightweight implant for a

421
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,240
campaign and once the campaign has run

422
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,279
its course

423
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,639
they will throw it out and they will

424
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,199
move on to another set of implants for

425
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,440
the next campaign

426
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,519
am i going too fast is this okay is this

427
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
enough to digest okay i tend to get go

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
fast when i

429
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
get really excited so

430
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,120
okay so in 2021 we also saw the

431
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,800
diversification of their entry vectors

432
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
you know they love using maldox and even

433
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
today you know they they still use

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,079
malicious documents to infect users with

435
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
crimson riot and oblique rat

436
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
but as part of this latest campaign

437
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,079
in around around june 2021 we saw them

438
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,720
start to experiment with different

439
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,079
entry vectors you know these are

440
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
basically files that are the beginning

441
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
of the infection chain

442
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
we saw them use image files img files we

443
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,360
even saw them use vmware hdx files

444
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
i don't know why honestly why they were

445
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,399
doing that but

446
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
maybe it was effective

447
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
we saw them use rar archives hosted on

448
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,199
cms legit cms services like google drive

449
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
and you know onedrive etc

450
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
and then in january and february we saw

451
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
them start using fake installers for

452
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
different types of applications and that

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
has

454
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,079
that that practice has uh continued into

455
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,000
march and april as well yes you had a

456
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,079
question

457
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,240
files or anything like that no not yet

458
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,320
not that i've not that i've known of

459
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,959
what's what's interesting about these um

460
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
these both of these apt groups is that

461
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
they don't like implement experimenting

462
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
a lot

463
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
so um you know anything that works for

464
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
them they will continue to use those

465
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,079
tactics for years and years and years

466
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,880
and

467
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
i don't know why that is maybe they

468
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,639
don't want to be agile maybe they're too

469
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
bureaucratic an organization

470
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
of

471
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
you know it's that's just up for

472
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,319
speculation but that's something that

473
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
we've observed in the past as well so

474
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,679
they don't like experimenting a lot

475
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,480
honestly uh for example we haven't seen

476
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
them use any sort of zero-day exploits

477
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
uh over the course of their campaigns

478
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,760
over the past five or six years so you

479
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,039
know they're like hey if malicious

480
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,520
documents that contain macros work for

481
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
us then why not why should we invest in

482
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
finding zero days so and that kind of

483
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
makes sense you know whatever works for

484
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,520
you so

485
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,679
all right let's take a look at side copy

486
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,440
now site copy is the new kid on the

487
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
block the new addition to the family

488
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
um when as i go through side copy you

489
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
will realize that a lot that side copy

490
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,360
is very very similar to transparent

491
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
tribe but i still want to go through it

492
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,679
and i still want to talk about it

493
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,000
because there are some key similarities

494
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,520
between the two groups but there are

495
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
also some key differences which is why

496
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
we're tracking them as two separate

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
entities and we haven't merged them into

498
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,520
the transparent tribe umbrella right so

499
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
in terms of targeting trans uh sorry

500
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
side copy also targets the indian

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,919
subcontinent they will go after india

502
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
and afghanistan and pakistan they will

503
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
target government entities they love

504
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
going after military and diplomatic

505
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,960
targets

506
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
for some reason um well that's espionage

507
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,039
so

508
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
okay so

509
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
here's an interesting fact so the name

510
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,720
side copy comes from the fact that this

511
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
apt group

512
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
loves to copy tactics and techniques

513
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,000
from an allegedly indian apt group

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,679
called sidebinder

515
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,480
so uh this is funny and not ironic cause

516
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,440
you know um at one and at one end you've

517
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
got site copy which is a pakistani apd

518
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,960
group and then you've got sidewinder

519
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
which is an indian apt group

520
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,039
and they're both adversaries of each

521
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,039
other but they love copying from from

522
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,039
one another

523
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,360
so basically their infection chains are

524
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
very similar it starts out as a

525
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
shortcut file or an lnk file a link file

526
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,799
and what follows is

527
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
different components of the cactus torch

528
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,559
offensive framework along with side

529
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,960
loading of dlls etc but the final

530
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
payloads are very different in the case

531
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,840
of side copy and sidewinder

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,640
in the case of side copy

533
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,360
now side copy loves using two implants

534
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
one is called satarat

535
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
i know this isn't a cool name i'm very

536
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,880
bad at naming malware implants uh it's a

537
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
c sharp based custom rat family it is

538
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
the most widely used rat family

539
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,480
for side copy

540
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
in fact

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,640
side copy love cedar red so much that

542
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
sometimes they will deploy twice on an

543
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
infected endpoint without realizing that

544
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,919
they've deployed the malware twice on

545
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,440
the actual endpoint

546
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,919
uh the second uh rack that they love is

547
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,559
aliko rat this is a commodity rat it's

548
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,799
been available in the while since 2017

549
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
it's a delphi based rat it's

550
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
it's very easy to um

551
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
to to operationalize you know to

552
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
configure to operationalize and to

553
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
deploy you know as in the case of a lot

554
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
of commodity rats

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
uh we have seen alako rat being

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,240
progressively being used with satarat

557
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
you know increasingly being used with

558
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,679
satarat over the course of the past uh

559
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
couple of years as well

560
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,960
now in 2021 uh we saw an explosion of

561
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,679
rat families being used by side copy we

562
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
saw the introduction of another ad

563
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,159
family called data rat

564
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,159
it's pretty similar to satarat but it's

565
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
not quite the same which is why we gave

566
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,919
it a different name

567
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
we saw them using reverse rat which is

568
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
basically a reverse shell created in c

569
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
sharp and it's got some other

570
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
functionality in inside of it as well

571
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,760
then we saw the attackers deploy

572
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
margulis rat

573
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,280
which is yet another ad in c sharp

574
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,480
then there came action rat which is a

575
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
rat that looks like alicor but it's not

576
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
quite um it's this is a custom bespoke

577
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
implementation of

578
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,440
a delphi based and a c-sharp base track

579
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,679
which we're calling action rat and then

580
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,520
we saw a number of commodity rats like

581
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,760
nj rat and lilith and epicenter being

582
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
used by the attackers at some point in

583
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,600
time

584
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,439
against their uh their targets

585
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,360
now

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
we also found

587
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
many components many

588
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
supporting components used in their

589
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
infection chains that we can't quite

590
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
term as uh full-fledged implants which

591
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,919
is why we're calling them plug-ins so we

592
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,760
found different kinds of plug-ins like

593
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,600
you know file managers and browser

594
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
credential stealers and key loggers of

595
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,919
different types you know like sheetan

596
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,559
and law these are commodity key loggers

597
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,919
that are available

598
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:40,960
online

599
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
and then we also found a golang based

600
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
component that we call nodaci

601
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,840
this component is mainly geared towards

602
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,679
uh stealing um

603
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,280
browser credentials and login

604
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
information and you know wi-fi

605
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
credentials as well it uses a library

606
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,400
called google lasagna um

607
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
and um we also saw the attackers try to

608
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,360
uh use this implant sorry this plug-in

609
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
for uh exfiltrating different types of

610
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
files that were of interest to them so

611
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
you know something like the backup

612
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,559
database for the two-factor

613
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
authentication application that's used

614
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
by the government of india so they were

615
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
specifically looking for those types of

616
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
files that they wanted to exfiltrate

617
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
now um side copies sidecorp is a very

618
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,760
new group right it's the so it it it's

619
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
very obvious that they'll be highly

620
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
motivated as well you know they want to

621
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,880
prove their uh significance they want to

622
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,240
prove their metal

623
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
and which is why they took their

624
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,240
operations a step further

625
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
side copy will actively try to harvest

626
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,320
credentials for their targets and they

627
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,440
have spa they've set up like a ton of

628
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
websites like they said hundreds and

629
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
hundreds of phishing websites that they

630
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
send out to their targets and uh on the

631
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
screen i've got an example of that this

632
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,840
is a fake page for the webmail of the

633
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
government of india and they send it out

634
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
to a target and then you know they get

635
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,960
tricked into putting in their

636
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
credentials and they can harvest those

637
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,120
credentials

638
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,600
okay so now let's take a look at their

639
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,840
let i'll take a very quick look at their

640
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
lures and decoys

641
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,360
if you take a look at this list it's

642
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
very similar to that of a transparent

643
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,280
tribe you know the defense theme think

644
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
tanks diplomatic themes and even honey

645
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
traps

646
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,919
that's that's because um

647
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
here's what i feel um they're two

648
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,760
separate entities but they have the same

649
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,679
set of goals they answer to the same set

650
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
of people which is why they conduct

651
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,159
different

652
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,520
operations operations that are different

653
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
technically but they have the same set

654
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
of people that they want to infect

655
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
all right so

656
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
yeah this is a defense themed uh

657
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
document that they used as a decoy from

658
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
2021 january 2021 and this is from this

659
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
is this is a document that they obtained

660
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
from the indian army through some means

661
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,279
and they started using it as a decoy and

662
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,960
it's basically a list of it's a

663
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
seniority list of officers and one of

664
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
their commands in the in the indian army

665
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
now um they

666
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,679
sidecopy loves to go after think tanks

667
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,400
as well just like a transparent tribe

668
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
we've seen them

669
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
target different uh individuals

670
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,960
associated with different think tanks

671
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
that are associated with the indian

672
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
military

673
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,440
some of the think tanks that were

674
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
targeted are claws sanjo's and orf claus

675
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
is the center for land and warfare

676
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,360
studies

677
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,279
uh senjo's

678
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,000
is related to the indian army as well um

679
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,679
this is this too long an abbreviation

680
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
for me to remember honestly so

681
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,919
oh wait i've got it on my notes center

682
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,000
for joint warfare studies oh it's it's

683
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
directly sponsored by the indian army

684
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
and then you've got the orf which is the

685
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,400
open research foundation

686
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,080
the screenshot on the screen that i have

687
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,360
for you is an article from february 2021

688
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,480
by the orf it was published

689
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
in in their in their journal

690
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
and it was geared towards their readers

691
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,159
and this

692
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
infection chain well this decoy is used

693
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
ultimately results in the deployment of

694
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,520
nj rat on the victim's endpoints

695
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,240
in terms of diplomatic themes so so far

696
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
i've been showing you a lot of

697
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,559
malicious documents and lures that are

698
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,200
related to india but i wanted to show

699
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
you something about afghanistan as well

700
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,000
so this is a lure and a decoy that was

701
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,960
used by side copy where uh you know once

702
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
the infection is successful they would

703
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
show this decoy document to their

704
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
victims and it's basically from the high

705
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
council for national reconciliation in

706
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,799
afghanistan and um this was this is a

707
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,039
council that was established

708
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,120
for reconciliation between the previous

709
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,559
government of afghanistan and the

710
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,600
taliban so you know they actively target

711
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,799
um

712
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
afghanistan afghani agencies as well

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
and similarly we've got honey traps this

714
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
is they have a very close resemblance

715
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
with transparent tribe as well uh the

716
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
example that i have here for you guys is

717
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,159
uh is of an afghanistani individual it's

718
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,480
a lady and they have you know they used

719
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,320
her resume to

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
try to infect

721
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,760
their targets it's very similar

722
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,279
transparent tribe also tends to use

723
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,880
resume themed and you know i guess side

724
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
copy has learned from that and they're

725
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,679
now

726
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,440
adopting the same

727
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
technique and the same tactic

728
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
okay i've been going too fast and

729
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
i'm sure you guys are falling asleep so

730
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,200
i'm going to summarize now i promise

731
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
this is going to be like three slides i

732
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,640
promise

733
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,799
okay so there's a lot of similarities

734
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,840
between

735
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,679
side copy and transparent tribe right

736
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,559
like

737
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,400
the kind of people they target the

738
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
tactics they use the lures that they use

739
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,120
so it's a very fair assumption to um to

740
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,520
think that they're both the same

741
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,559
right

742
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,520
and

743
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
there are similarities to support that

744
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
assumption as well they target the same

745
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,159
geography they go after india and

746
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,279
afghanistan and even pakistan

747
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,440
they have very similar themes in their

748
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,760
lures and their decoys they go after

749
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,120
defense and

750
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
diplomatic and you know they use honey

751
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,520
trap tactics as well

752
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,279
in terms of technical operations we've

753
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,919
seen both the apt groups use the same

754
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,520
vps providers

755
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,399
like contebo and others

756
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:27,840
and they love cloning websites of

757
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
interest this is another tactic that

758
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,159
they share with each other

759
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,440
however um there are some key

760
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
differences

761
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,399
first of all they operate a very

762
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,240
different suit of malware

763
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
we haven't seen a lot of code

764
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,679
similarities we haven't seen a lot of

765
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,520
similarities in the way the malware has

766
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,640
written you know there's a specific

767
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,159
coding style when somebody's writing

768
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,440
code

769
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
and both uh

770
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
the malware for both these apts are very

771
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,399
mutually exclusive from each other and

772
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,080
that includes their infection chains as

773
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,559
well um you know transparent tribes

774
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,320
infection chains are usually very short

775
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,559
and sweet to the point they don't want

776
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
they want to be as healthy as possible

777
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
side copy on the other hand is

778
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
you know they're still learning if

779
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,559
if i'm being tactful about it

780
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,240
in terms of operational security

781
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,159
transparent tribe is way more mature

782
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
like they will conduct their operations

783
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,559
so that things can't be traced back to

784
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,640
them side copy is still learning that

785
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
there's some operational mistakes that

786
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,279
they make that makes you feel that you

787
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,640
know they're still learning you know

788
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,080
there's still some noobs in that group

789
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
also we haven't seen any technical

790
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
infrastructure and overlap between these

791
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
two groups between the domains and the

792
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,080
ip addresses and the cnc addresses that

793
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,279
they operate

794
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,799
we've hardly we've never seen any um

795
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,480
you know overlap between them which

796
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
suggests that the two distinct groups

797
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
that are operating uh with each other

798
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,240
you know

799
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
they're operating alongside each other

800
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
but they have their own teams and their

801
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,799
own ways of getting things done

802
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,039
and that brings us to the end of the

803
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,840
presentation um so i've got i've got a

804
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
few links for you on on the screen

805
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,960
um the these this is the research that

806
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
we've done over the years tracking both

807
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,159
of these groups

808
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,679
and and their different campaigns as

809
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,799
well

810
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,039
and with that um

811
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,360
i will open this up for

812
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,799
for any questions that you have might

813
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
have for me any feedback any blessings

814
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,080
any beer i'll take it all

815
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
um so it it's it's not really

816
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
significant but it shows a preference in

817
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,279
their coding styles as well you know

818
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,440
everyone has a different coding style

819
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
um

820
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,559
a lot of new age apt groups

821
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,840
you know especially when they're in the

822
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,279
learning phase of when they're in a very

823
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,960
nascent phase of their operations tend

824
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,480
to focus on technologies that they can

825
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
understand and i'm sure c plus

826
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
c sharp is way more easier than c and c

827
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,919
plus plus so i mean maybe that's just a

828
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
design choice

829
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
so

830
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,480
sure do you have a question uh yeah i

831
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,919
just want to say uh thank you

832
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,279
proxy

833
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,640
fuzzer okay um

834
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,600
welcome i have no idea what they are

835
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,000
i'm i'm honestly i'm not a product guy i

836
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,279
just track uh apts that's all i do for

837
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,520
for a daily basis but yeah i'll i'll

838
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,039
take that forward i'll take that forward

839
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,720
yeah yeah i'll take that as a win

840
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,880
so uh they they tend to use a lot of

841
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
different kinds of vps providers but

842
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
contaibo is the one that they absolutely

843
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,600
love

844
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
um

845
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,360
they will set up oh yeah so

846
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,919
here's an example of um here's an

847
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
example of the domains they set up so

848
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
they will set up short and sweet domains

849
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
that look like they're very very benign

850
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
and they're very

851
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
inconspicuous if i may say

852
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,519
but um you know they actually end up

853
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,760
serving malware also um

854
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,840
they don't care about disclosures no

855
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,919
matter how how many times we go after

856
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,440
them know many times

857
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,960
no matter how many times we disclose

858
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
their operations they will continue to

859
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,679
use the same domains again and again and

860
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
again like i don't know whether they're

861
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,440
just being lazy or you know they just

862
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
don't give a i don't honestly i

863
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,279
don't know like like some of the

864
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,880
websites that i've listed here and some

865
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,240
of the screenshots that i've shown here

866
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,600
i'm pretty sure they're active even

867
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
right now like i can

868
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
and they're serving the same documents

869
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
even now so

870
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
it's

871
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,320
frustrating at times

872
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,039
right so we've been tracking them for a

873
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
long time so we have some amount of

874
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
institutional knowledge as well but we

875
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
also rely on a lot of open source

876
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
reporting from other firms as well

877
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,600
and uh that's basically what we do so

878
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,840
you know for example a transparent tribe

879
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
has been attributed to pakistan again

880
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
and again and again

881
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,840
and crimson rat for example is not a

882
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,679
commodity right so you know an infection

883
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,760
chain that usually leads to crimson rat

884
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,679
is associated with transparent tribe in

885
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,279
one form on the other

886
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,840
um in terms of side copy we've also done

887
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
pretty much the same thing

888
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,559
we know that side copy is associated

889
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,559
with a transparent tribe

890
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,640
they use the same kind of tactics and

891
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
they use

892
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
you know the same kind of techniques as

893
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
well

894
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
so i guess i guess

895
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,600
that's what i'm trying to say we rely on

896
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,880
a lot of institutional knowledge as well

897
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
also we rely a lot on our telemetry as

898
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
well so we've tried to figure out who uh

899
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,120
who's being attacked who the target is

900
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,679
you know that's a very big uh part of

901
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,200
who's being attacked and then we also

902
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,399
have to figure out you know what

903
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,480
geography is being attacked you know how

904
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,240
anomalous is this you know if you see

905
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,039
crimson rad being target used to target

906
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,360
um say a completely different country

907
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
it's an anomaly we will still consider

908
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,559
that but we have to

909
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,720
um you know consider all the facts and

910
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
consider the possibility that um you

911
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,120
know this might be a

912
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,640
the result of leak

913
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,720
in some cases so all of that needs to be

914
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,559
considered and then we you know do the

915
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,519
attribution bit of it

916
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
the chinese like to conduct their own

917
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,399
operations yeah

918
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,840
they're very possessive about them

919
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,000
yeah honestly i don't i don't know um

920
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,559
what goes on behind the scenes but uh

921
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,039
i'm not really sure how much of a con

922
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,000
how much how confident the chinese are

923
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,799
uh with the pakistanis with sharing the

924
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,559
their infrastructure and their ttps you

925
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,960
know apds usually don't tend to do that

926
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,919
unless there's a leak

927
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,840
i hope not

928
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,879
uh

929
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
yeah they do that all the time they do

930
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,079
that all the time but they're very

931
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,399
trivial honestly

932
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,918
it's it's nothing that you can't defeat

933
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,000
if you look at the malware manually so

934
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,359
you know there's always a weight around

935
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,639
it but they do do that

936
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,199
well um

937
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,320
so they they tend to um

938
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,520
they tend to try to detect if there's a

939
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
specific av running in that specific

940
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,440
geography so you know how specific av

941
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
software is popular in specific

942
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,199
geographies so i'm not going to name

943
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,239
names but they try to detect those and

944
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
they're like oh you know if it's being

945
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,920
detected maybe we should um nope the

946
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,240
hell out of there or otherwise they're

947
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,920
like oh we'll take in some infection

948
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,040
chains they're like oh yeah we'll take a

949
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
note of it and you know so that we can

950
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
find a way to defeat this av in the

951
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
future and then

952
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,760
use that in our infection chains

953
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,720
that's it am i missing someone

954
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,800
okay thank you so much for

955
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
tolerating this presentation

956
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,570
thank you so much

957
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,920
[Applause]

958
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,680
23 minutes okay
