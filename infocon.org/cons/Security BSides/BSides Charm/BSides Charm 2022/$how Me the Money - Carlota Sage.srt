1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,519
hi

2
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
hello welcome to show me the money

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,560
this is how you get business buy-in for

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
a small organization to start your

5
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
security program it is also known as are

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
you sure you want to be a cesa i you

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
know i'm not so sure you want to do that

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,840
um

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
i'm going to spend a few minutes talking

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
about myself because i'm awesome

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
and

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,719
thank you

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
and i like me a lot so this is my mug

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,360
with my mug i'm carlita sage

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
i am a virtual cso principal meaning i'm

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
really good at being a vc so i guess i

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
don't know with a company called

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,399
fractional c sound fractional c so

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,840
serves

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
smaller small midsize organizations

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
usually sub 200 employee organizations

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
they're small enough that they can't

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,720
hire a full-time cso they're not ready

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
for that step but they've also

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
recognized oh hey

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
that security stuff is kind of important

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
especially to sales who knew

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,439
so i'd say of our 30 clients 30-ish

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,759
clients majority of our prospects come

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
to us because

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
their clients are going hey i'm

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
interested in your product but

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
like are you stock2 compliant like do

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,040
you do anything about security and that

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
is what drives them to us

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,560
that's about 85 of them the other 15 the

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,119
big majority of that is investors or

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,720
board of directors say

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
hey this is cool and all but i want to

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
protect the money and uh you need cyber

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
security so why don't you go hire a

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,520
virtual cso firm or something like that

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,000
that that tiny little one i have exactly

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
one customer out of 30 that came because

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
they had an incident so

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,079
the good news is that small and

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,560
mid-sized businesses are looking at this

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
earlier and they're taking it more

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
seriously now before i was a virtual cso

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,520
because at no point in my career did i

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,599
go i want to be a virtual cso that seems

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
like a great idea because nobody knew

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,239
what a virtual cso is you probably

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
in this room how many of you had

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
actually heard of a virtual suitor

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
before this weekend

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
like yeah

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
only because you knew me right so

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,640
like it's it's a growing niche because

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,599
smaller

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
and smaller organizations do need

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,640
security

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
and they need that strategic advisement

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
we are purely strategic advisement we do

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
not do any hands-on work if you want

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
somebody to come in and do tacky-tappy

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,560
stuff i either tell you i look at your

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
job description and tell you

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,599
yeah that looks like a good job

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,200
description i'll interview top three

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
candidates or i say you know my client

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
over here is using this msp or this mssp

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
whatever

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
this consulting group i'll make an

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,440
introduction but then i step out because

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
i don't do that i'm purely advisory

77
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,360
before i became a vcso though i spent a

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,519
lot of time in silicon valley by attack

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,000
i mostly spent my time

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
doing large scale content management

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,239
systems help centers knowledge bases

82
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,200
that sort of thing so if you go to

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,360
support.netgear.com or

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
health.netflix.com

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,799
those were my babies back in 2010 2012.

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,599
um

87
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
from what i can tell netflix actually

88
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
hasn't changed it so i guess i did a

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,159
good job they got the money to spend

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,720
uh and and for support websites it's

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,959
really easy to prove roi

92
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,319
um so

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,319
it was great for me to say hey if you

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,040
spend 140 000 setting this piece up or

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
240 000 whatever it cost

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
i can save you x amount of money in call

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
center operations so that is a direct

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
here's the money you spend here's the

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,720
money i'm going to save you

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
let's do it much easier kind of sell

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
especially at scale

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
that whole process is called knowledge

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
strategy

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,400
and that knowledge strategy boils down

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
to people processes and technology you

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,159
hear that a lot in cyber security

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,478
because cyber security is a knowledge

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,000
industry so

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
i spent my time at netgear netflix i did

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,520
a stint at facebook consulting to them

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
and then i took a little six-week

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
contract with a tiny company called

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
fireeye back in 2013

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,479
and five years later when i quit i was

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
like you know i didn't like the company

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
so much but this industry is amazing so

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
um so here i am i actually started out

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
on their ip operations side

119
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
i hopped over to their support

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
operations side because again i'm really

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
good at metrics right

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
and uh

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
one day their community person came to

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
me and said hey

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,680
i can't find any product documentation

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
for the ipmi product and i'm like

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
you didn't even google that because ipm

128
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,360
is a hardware studio bro it's not

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,680
are you okay what's going on out there

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
in those communities what's what

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
questions are getting answered or asked

132
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
and it turned out a lot of random

133
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,639
questions were getting asked right

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
security covers a lot of areas sometimes

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
it's networking sometimes it's hardware

136
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,280
sometimes it's product um

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
but the community guy was neither

138
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
technical or interested in security so

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,320
we kind of pissed off everyone in the

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
company and support engineers sustaining

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,440
engineers and they stopped answering

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
customer questions

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,000
so i spent my last three years at

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
fit

145
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
where was i fireeye

146
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,600
um

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,080
managing the communities and helping

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,639
dozens and you can say hundreds of

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
security teams solve problems

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,080
so

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
what do you do like not many companies

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
are forward thinking enough

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,919
to have that involvement in a community

154
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,120
um

155
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
so there was nowhere else for me to go

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,960
it was hard for me to move around inside

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
the company because

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
nobody wanted to be the person that

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
poached karluda out of the communities

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
everyone felt like that would be a bad

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,280
move so i was having a hard time getting

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,400
a job inside the company um and i really

163
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
just didn't like my boss so i took off i

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
started my own company started doing

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,199
consulting was doing virtual cto work

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
ended up fell into virtual seats at work

167
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
so that's kind of the

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
everything you need to know about how

169
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,919
carluda got into cyber security and i

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,960
give you that

171
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
not just for contacts but because if

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
you're early in your career i want you

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
to understand that you can come to bc so

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
or cesa work

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,759
any different path there are a lot of

176
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
paths in cyber security if you're a

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
hiring manager in this room i want you

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,280
to understand i'm a college dropout i

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
dropped out of auburn university um i

180
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
was a marine biology major uh took me 13

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
years to finally graduate from nc state

182
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
i did community college in there at the

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
same time eventually went back for my

184
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
master's at columbia university the

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
carlotta who graduated from auburn

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
university and the carolina who

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
graduated from columbia

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
same amount of talent and skill i was

189
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,599
just a lot more expensive on the other

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,960
side so

191
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
um i am a big proponent of not requiring

192
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,599
certs not requiring degrees and i will

193
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,039
die on that hill

194
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880
uh the other thing that i do

195
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,479
um i am on the board of directors for

196
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
the diana initiative which is an

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,880
inclusivity and cyber security group

198
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,199
we meet during that black cat def con

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,479
come see us

200
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,160
and i do a lot of posting on

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,440
twitter

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
my meme game has gotten a lot better

203
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
since i know this mick guy

204
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,039
and you can also find me on linkedin

205
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
where i actually post useful information

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
for smaller mid-sized businesses

207
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
so

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,240
come on

209
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
all right so that that gave you a lot of

210
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
context i gotta give you a lot more

211
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,840
context than you what you need

212
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,400
um okay so this is more context part of

213
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,080
the reason that i

214
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
created this particular talk

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
is because

216
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
there are 5.6 million small businesses

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,319
in the united states alone that's sub

218
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
500 employees

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
um the majority of those have less than

220
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,160
100 employees

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,319
they all need to get secure

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
but we always hear from those vendors

223
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,360
and the enterprises for those big scale

224
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,800
solutions where people are throwing

225
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
money at the problem

226
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
those clients that i'm serving i am

227
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
their security budget

228
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
that's it like i'm gonna have to justify

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
every cost that i ask of them unless

230
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
they are very well very well funded um

231
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
and it's not a bad thing i'm not going

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,319
to knock the vendors

233
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,919
and the enterprises but you know there's

234
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,039
only

235
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,839
500 fortune 500 companies

236
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
how applicable is their model to yours

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
if your sub 500 people probably not at

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
all

239
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
which brings us back to this knowledge

240
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,640
strategy people process technology

241
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
my clients can't afford that bottom line

242
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
if you're in this room you are probably

243
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
very familiar with that bottom line so

244
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,000
we're not going to talk about that

245
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
bottom line we're going to focus on

246
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
people

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,839
processes and that data or if you're in

248
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,320
a hospital situation the lives

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
that you're trying to protect so

250
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
if you're looking for a technical visual

251
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
talk

252
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
there's your time to escape

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
um

254
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
yes so

255
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
i'm trying to decide how much kind of

256
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
background i don't want this to be a

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
sales pitch for my services but i think

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
understanding what i do for small

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
companies is helpful for people

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
basically when you engage me

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
you get me you get a cyber security

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
analyst we do a gap analysis you are

263
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
here i need you to be here

264
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
for some basic level of cyber security

265
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
all of our cyber security programs are

266
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,680
meant to be

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,519
feed into compliance programs because we

268
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
all know compliance does not equal

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
security so we are very much about

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
security first even if you want if

271
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
you're coming to us saying i want to

272
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
talk to your compliance i'm like right

273
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,680
that's great we're going to get you

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
secure and along the way we're going to

275
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,519
get you compliant

276
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,560
um

277
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
we do a lot of stuff we look at your aws

278
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
configurations we do all of that stuff

279
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
so

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,160
for our purposes though just from that

281
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,279
people

282
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,640
process

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
technology perspective

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
i want to focus on the people lens first

285
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
there are a lot of concepts here

286
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
um

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
you are not your average customer if you

288
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
are in cyber security you are

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,839
automatically

290
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,240
not anything like the people you serve

291
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,160
whether they're internal customers or

292
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
external customers and i cannot stress

293
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
this enough your job is to make them

294
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,440
secure their job is to produce something

295
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
you've got to find a way

296
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
to set your expectations realistically

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
like it's great if i could people to not

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
teach people to not click on links

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,360
awesome

300
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,079
right they are doing what i need them to

301
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
do i can't expect too much more a little

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
more

303
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
but

304
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
it's important that we recognize that

305
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
our customers don't think like us

306
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,079
is very different

307
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,200
you cannot succeed in cyber security

308
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,839
with securing an organization

309
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,600
if others in your organization are not

310
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
invested in your success so you have to

311
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
be empathetic if you are thinking about

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,560
being some kind of bcso role you have to

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
be approachable you know as mick was

314
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
talking earlier in his keynote he's like

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
oh russia's gonna get you yeah i can't

316
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
he's right you can't do that he's

317
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
talking to 20 year olds i'm talking to

318
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
business folks

319
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,240
but i've got to make it seem like i

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
really care about what they're doing and

321
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
that i want to hear them

322
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,839
and that's

323
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
really important

324
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
i you know there's we dandy around you

325
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
know the average season 10 years like

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
two and a half years and i think that

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,160
burnout comes because

328
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
they're approaching it from the security

329
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
perspective and they're banging their

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
head on this wall over and over again

331
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
and they're not stepping back and

332
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
thinking

333
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,079
this isn't working

334
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,639
to try something else and that something

335
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,360
else you try is shutting up listening

336
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,839
for a little while giving more context

337
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,639
on why this is a relay race i need you

338
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,959
to take the baton and run with it hand

339
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
me the baton and i'll run with it

340
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
when you give people contacts they are

341
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
more interested in helping you

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
and my last mantra when it comes to

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,480
people

344
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,560
any friction that you create to a

345
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
process is immediately an obstacle

346
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
and they will do everything they can to

347
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
work around that right so

348
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,079
multi-factor authentication let's turn

349
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
that on

350
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,160
that's great

351
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
how many people have been in an i.t

352
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
order in a small word i've seen this

353
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
several times you turn on multi-factor

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
authentication and everybody just

355
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,920
enrages

356
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,479
turn it on

357
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,519
you did not communicate effectively

358
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,600
why you're turning this on when you're

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
turning it on why it's important to them

360
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,079
why

361
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
this will in the long run help them do

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,720
their job better because then i can just

363
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
bug out you don't have to call id as

364
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,800
much you can just you know do this

365
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
um any time you are altering somebody

366
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
else's process

367
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
you are potentially creating friction

368
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
and that becomes an obstacle to be very

369
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
aware about that that's where change

370
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
management becomes

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,240
really important

372
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,760
so

373
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,040
as

374
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
we hear in doctor strange it's not about

375
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
you and it's not about security it is

376
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,240
about

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,040
making the people in your organization

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
understand why they need to do what

379
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,199
you're asking why i'm asking you not to

380
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
click on links marketing why i'm asking

381
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,959
you to turn multi-factor authentication

382
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
on in linkedin and facebook i'm going to

383
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,440
give you a great example a couple of

384
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
months ago

385
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
went through a client's marketing team

386
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,839
made sure

387
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,920
all of their social media platforms had

388
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,760
multi-factor authentication turned on

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
and of course somebody can turn that off

390
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,279
you know

391
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,519
you can only confirm once once a quarter

392
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,839
that it's on

393
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,720
um

394
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
an attacker took over their facebook ads

395
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
account

396
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
and

397
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
while that attack facebook was on it

398
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,560
they they shut that down within 12 hours

399
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
they cleared out all the bad guys that's

400
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,880
great but they didn't turn the account

401
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
back over to my client

402
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,040
for two i think eight days

403
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
like the attackers got kicked out within

404
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
12 hours they're supposed to turn the

405
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
account over within 24 hours in that

406
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
eight days my client is losing because

407
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,440
they are not running facebook ads two

408
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
hundred thousand dollars a day

409
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
right

410
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,760
for a small business that's a lot of

411
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
money

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
scale that up right this is supply chain

413
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
that you don't think about sometimes

414
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
um advertising who would think that

415
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,320
that's going to be a million-dollar head

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,959
if i can't run facebook ads 1.4 million

417
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,079
so think about that

418
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
and as it turned out somebody in

419
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,920
marketing went back and forth out of

420
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
multi-factor authentication and we were

421
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,360
minus two marketing people that

422
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
following week so

423
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,959
um it really is about understanding and

424
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,199
empathizing with your audience and and

425
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
we're gonna get to stick with me here

426
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
this is i'm laying the groundwork for

427
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
where we get to the really good stuff

428
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,199
you need to understand what business

429
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
people care about

430
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,279
because they're there to run a business

431
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
as everyone points out security is a

432
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
cost center until you can tie security

433
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
to sales which i've done this with

434
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
clients oh

435
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
how many how many hundred thousand

436
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,519
dollar deals are you losing because

437
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,000
you're not stock two compliant

438
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
oh why don't you put that in the crm

439
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,279
now you have data awesome now you're

440
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,800
tying your cost center to actually

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
generating revenue

442
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
do a little things like this

443
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
and it does help the business understand

444
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
how

445
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
making your job easier makes it easier

446
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,240
to sell things so your executives care

447
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
about operational costs these are costs

448
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,000
the business know

449
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
and can plan for

450
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,279
um

451
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
and risk and that is anything that's

452
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
going to put pressure on the business

453
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
that's going to spur spending above

454
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,800
those known costs like

455
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
if i know my cost that's great

456
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,040
where are the costs that i don't know

457
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,199
are coming from and if you can tie your

458
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,560
stuff to any of those risks

459
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,480
now you can actually has charlene had

460
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
with her modeling if you didn't go next

461
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,360
door

462
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
if you can put a dollar value to risk

463
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,720
here's how much how likely a risk is how

464
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
much it will cost you if that happens

465
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
here's how much if we spend

466
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
we spend 30 thousand dollars and can

467
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
prevent 250 000 an unexpected spend

468
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,240
that's really valuable to a ceo and cfo

469
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
most of my clients i'm dealing with the

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
cfo

471
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,959
or the cto they don't have a cio they

472
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
probably don't even have an icy person

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,599
but about half of my clients the cfos

474
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,520
sit in our weekly meetings because they

475
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,000
consider this risk management and they

476
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
feel it's very important so if you can

477
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
talk about risk in terms of money

478
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,919
you can really get a cfo on your side

479
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,119
and that's the person you want on the

480
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,199
side because they control the money

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,039
your internal customers what they care

482
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,600
about is optimizing their work they want

483
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
maximum return for minimal effort we all

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,080
want to work smarter harder if you're

485
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
making it harder for them to work

486
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,559
smarter

487
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,280
they're going to ignore you

488
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,679
they want recognition shaming does not

489
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,559
work

490
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
it just doesn't

491
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
stop doing it um

492
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
one of the most effective things i've

493
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
seen is small in a small company i don't

494
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
know how this would scale but in a small

495
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
company in the it channel every time

496
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
somebody said hey i think this is a fish

497
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,960
to the it team somebody would grab a

498
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
screenshot post it into the it general

499
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
or the employee channel and say hey

500
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,679
thanks so so you're 100 right this is a

501
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
phishing email

502
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,280
appreciate you catching that

503
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
right

504
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
so now they've faked someone publicly

505
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
they've educated everyone else on the

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,679
fact that hey this is a fake email don't

507
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
click on this link please

508
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
right and it generates a lot of goodwill

509
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
you're also now making it awesome it

510
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
gets a little competitive you're the

511
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
first one to send that thing to the it

512
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
group yeah and then if you throw in a

513
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,120
couple of 25 amazon gift cards using

514
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
gift cards that's actually a very

515
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
effective security awareness training

516
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,000
program i kid you not it is one of the

517
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
most effective ones that i've seen

518
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
um

519
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
but that all ties into success

520
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
they need to know that you care that

521
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,679
they are good at what they do and that

522
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,799
you are enabling it

523
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
that's a hard one to do that's a lot of

524
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
social engineering i poured a lot of

525
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,480
whiskey in my day like i always ran in

526
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
my in-person backpack when i worked in

527
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,240
an office i always ran the weekly

528
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
whiskey for

529
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,039
because it's like oh hey you've done

530
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,240
really great this week come buy the

531
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
weekly whiskey for i'll give you a shot

532
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
of mcallen 18. right like i'll i'll give

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,480
you something really good

534
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,919
but

535
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
it's really important that people feel

536
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
like you're not holding them back in

537
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,440
that success that's where you know that

538
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
whole department of no becomes a problem

539
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
um

540
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
it's easier to get people to feel like

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
it's easier to get them invested in your

542
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,760
success as a security person or as a

543
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
citizen

544
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,039
if they feel like you are invested in

545
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799
their success right it's just little

546
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,918
tiny bits of psychology

547
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
okay so people process technology

548
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,880
ignoring technology we've just done

549
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
people

550
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
process can be a little bit boring so

551
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
i'm warning you

552
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
um

553
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
yeah run run

554
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,640
um

555
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
get the basics done

556
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,799
like there's no way around that doesn't

557
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,000
matter how much security

558
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
building you have if you don't have your

559
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,440
basics done

560
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,520
you are not doing it right period um

561
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
hardware digital asset inventories data

562
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
flow architecture diagrams policies

563
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
plans patch

564
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
change vulnerability management cyber

565
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,679
insurance

566
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
cyber insurance is one of those things

567
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
where i end up feeling really geeky

568
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
because i actually like reading through

569
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,799
insurance policies

570
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,640
but it's also the nice thing about

571
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,159
having a look across 30 different

572
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
clients is that now when i talk to one

573
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,080
of my clients i'm like

574
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,919
who is your broker because you're

575
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,000
freaking cyber insurance

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
you're getting

577
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
twice what my other clients are getting

578
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,799
for half the money

579
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,880
like they're they're paying twenty

580
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
thousand dollars a year for one million

581
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
dollar cyber insurance

582
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
sorry three million dollar cyber

583
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
insurance policy with a ten thousand

584
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
dollar retention and the retention is

585
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
kind of like it's acceptable but it's

586
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
per incident so if you have four

587
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
incidents you're paying 10 000. you're

588
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
not paying 10 000 for the year right um

589
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,880
most of my clients are paying 40 000

590
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
for 3 million and 100 000

591
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
retention so if you have a 900 you know

592
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,520
99 000 sorry 99 000 incident you're

593
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,679
paying for that entire incident and if

594
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,679
you get another one that's a hundred and

595
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,600
two thousand dollars you're paying for

596
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
the first hundred thousand and your

597
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,640
insurance is giving you two grand so

598
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
you've just paid two hundred thousand

599
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,240
dollars for

600
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,720
events right this is

601
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
like i said it's really pretty but one

602
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
of my favorite things

603
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,760
um

604
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
there is i realized that i came from

605
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
cyber security at a different angle for

606
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,559
my boss because i'm reading through this

607
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
other insurance

608
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,120
policy and i see that the

609
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
phone number for the claims ends in one

610
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,559
three three seven and they start

611
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,720
laughing like oh one three three seven

612
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,039
that's funny and my boss is like lie

613
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,000
like it's league it's it's leaked so you

614
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
don't know we'd speak i am in the wrong

615
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
place no yeah i'm in the right place um

616
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,320
policies and plans seem like a real time

617
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,200
save

618
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,120
they are i won't lie it's pain in the

619
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,520
ass to do them you write them for what

620
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
you're doing today even if you're not

621
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
doing stock compliance stock compliance

622
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
will really enforce this write policies

623
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
for what's going on now don't have some

624
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
aspirational we should be doing it this

625
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
way in your policy if it's not you've

626
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,919
got it right to what you're doing it

627
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,840
takes everything you want simpler

628
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,640
um

629
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
digital asset inventories hardware asset

630
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
inventories are the easy part digital

631
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,400
asset inventories are easier now that

632
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
people are in the cloud you can just

633
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,480
like

634
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
hit aws and

635
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
work its magic

636
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,159
data flow and architectural diagrams

637
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
legit are the hardest thing i have to do

638
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
with clients because they want you to do

639
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
it for it for them and it's like i don't

640
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
know you're a product man i don't know

641
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,559
your systems i know the security you

642
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
know your stuff that's how this works i

643
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
need you to write this stuff down

644
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
um

645
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
i am amazed at how few people can

646
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
legitimately do a data flow diagram it's

647
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
like box starts here

648
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
data goes from here to there it doesn't

649
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,240
seem like it's that hard

650
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,320
but i don't think i have very many

651
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,520
clients that can do it without me

652
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
actually talking them through the

653
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
process so if you can do those diagrams

654
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,919
you've got a great potential to be a cso

655
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,280
i'm just letting you know

656
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
uh the biggest thing that i've done

657
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
is a security health model and i was

658
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
calling the security material at one

659
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,159
point it's not accurate i don't like the

660
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,600
word maturity

661
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
um because it

662
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,600
it indicates that we're growing and we

663
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
get better or more sophisticated or more

664
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
aged at least you know

665
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,120
maturity has this connotation that you

666
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,760
move in one one direction right so if

667
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,640
you put the cnnc or the nist maternity

668
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
model in front of a business person

669
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
they have no idea what that means that

670
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
is completely meaningless they're great

671
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,400
maturity models for a security

672
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
practitioner because we have the

673
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,000
education that we can look at the model

674
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
and that's meaningful for us for ceo or

675
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
cfo it is not meaningful stop using it

676
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
don't throw that stuff stop copying

677
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
security to non-security people

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,919
this model is basically here's what's

679
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,240
healthy here's what's not healthy most

680
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
of my clients are starting somewhere

681
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,799
between

682
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,440
that left and middle space and so i've

683
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,520
got this um

684
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,080
piecemeal compliance driven risk base

685
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
really it's ad hoc grassroots someone

686
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
somewhere in an organization is trying

687
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
to do security

688
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,919
but they're kind of that one person

689
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,440
who's doing it maybe they're not doing

690
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,880
it well but they're they're putting that

691
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
effort in there

692
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
that's great i want to make that person

693
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
feel really good that compliance driven

694
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
can also be team driven once you've

695
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,919
gotten to a point where you've got one

696
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,039
person

697
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,600
focused and dedicated to security for my

698
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,360
clients that person is me

699
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
um and they're only getting me for three

700
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
hours a week so how focused is it really

701
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,039
um but once there is some kind of

702
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
structure or program around that

703
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
security

704
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,840
you're moving towards that middle

705
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,320
section that right hand section that's

706
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,679
advanced that's where you're getting

707
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,520
security when you're getting your sims

708
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
and your

709
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,600
you know whatever

710
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,520
you're getting more advanced here i want

711
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,840
my people to be in that middle column if

712
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
we put this on a one to five scale that

713
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
middle column's a three three means that

714
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
it's documented repeatable and scalable

715
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,159
that's what i need for my clients if i

716
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,039
can get them to that point that is very

717
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,360
successful and the way that that you

718
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,760
measure a security program before you

719
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,919
have a security program is that you take

720
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,159
this you put it on one to five scale and

721
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,799
you literally ask questions about that i

722
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
don't have that in the stack because

723
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
it's a long

724
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,799
kind of assessment

725
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
i do have it in my github

726
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,200
it is free it's under creative commons

727
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,039
so if you are in a smaller organization

728
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,559
or you have a friend who's in a smaller

729
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,240
organization or you're just trying to

730
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,679
talk about security the non-security

731
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,840
people you're more than welcome to take

732
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,200
that uh github.com

733
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,679
show me the money uh no dollar sign but

734
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,799
literally

735
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,600
really important that that and and in my

736
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,840
contracts part of the reason the cfo or

737
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
cta shows up after these and our

738
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,320
contracts say the executive sponsor will

739
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,559
be involved in this product in process

740
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,320
right because we signed three-year

741
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
contracts we want you to understand

742
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
security is a process it's an ongoing

743
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
need it is not a project it is not one

744
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,520
and done

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
um

746
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,799
the biggest thing

747
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,679
for my clients is just being able to say

748
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,960
to their board

749
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
here's where we are

750
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
here is where we're moving

751
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,559
oh here's where we were last quarter

752
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,720
here is where we are now and if they can

753
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
do that with little check marks on this

754
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
chart that's fine whatever it takes to

755
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
start communicating

756
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,640
security at a very simple level but

757
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
meaningful like this is a lot of

758
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,520
verbiage

759
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,279
but it's helpful

760
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,919
i've never seen a c-suite look at this

761
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,600
and their eyes glaze over they look at

762
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
this and go oh i see the green side

763
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
that's where i really spend money right

764
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
now i guess that is where you really

765
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,000
spend money because that's where the

766
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
real tooling comes in but

767
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,039
it's also a lot less scary when i tell a

768
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,679
client who's only got 50 employees i

769
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,000
just need you to be yellow i just need

770
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
you to be a three i just need you to

771
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
write stuff down

772
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
make it repeatable and make sure that

773
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,919
it's going to scale as you grow because

774
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,760
a lot of my clients

775
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
fractional has 30-ish clients i have

776
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,399
eight that i serve

777
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,559
most of mine are e-commerce or sas we

778
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
have things like a private college we've

779
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,200
got a medical device company i have a

780
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
software uh a security vendor a security

781
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
startup as a client why would a security

782
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
startup need a fractional cso because

783
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,320
they're 50 people and their money is

784
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,960
spent on creating product but they also

785
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,279
understand if we don't have a program

786
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,720
we're not going to sell to the bigger

787
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
clients right so we set up their program

788
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,880
we're going to help them hire their

789
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
first eso send them on their way

790
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,640
it's a lot less scary for me to say to a

791
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,440
cfo i need you to be a three i don't

792
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
need you to be a five i need you to be a

793
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
three i need the security company to be

794
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,120
a five because they're a security

795
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
company i need the person who makes a

796
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,399
physical security product for airports i

797
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,200
need them to be a for me i need my

798
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
i need my auction website to be at war

799
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
but most clients i just need you to be a

800
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,960
three

801
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
you just got to take the fear out of

802
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,039
security you've got to make it

803
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,600
accessible once you take out the fear

804
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
and you make it accessible you get them

805
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,840
on board now once you have leadership on

806
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
board it's a whole lot easier there's

807
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,760
there's a certain amount of trickle down

808
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,799
and there's a certain amount of

809
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
grassroots pushing up if you can get

810
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,279
kind of both ends and work towards the

811
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,960
middle you will be very similar

812
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
which brings me to

813
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
the lens that isn't in our people

814
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,919
process technology piece is the money

815
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,799
right

816
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,440
how do i get people to pay for security

817
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
when i can't communicate security to

818
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,399
them well now you can communicate

819
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,799
security to them but more importantly in

820
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,799
that same github i have a bunch of

821
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,039
really simple excel sheets that you can

822
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,279
download and start actually

823
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,559
conversations and the first one is a

824
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,720
really simple efficiency return on

825
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
investment

826
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,880
so if i'm saying i want to spend 30 000

827
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
on a piece of security tooling

828
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
what is it what is it really getting us

829
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,520
giving us more secure okay it's giving

830
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,799
us back

831
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,600
15 hours a week you know of eight

832
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
employees 15 minutes a day of 80

833
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,039
employees it's giving us something

834
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
and that's theoretical product

835
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,159
productivity is a squishy number

836
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
i've never had a cfo come back and go i

837
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,440
just don't believe this i've had them

838
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,559
adjust the numbers because to them

839
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,640
time is money and they will make these

840
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
numbers work in a way that's meaningful

841
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,640
for them so if you can say i'm going to

842
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
save people money at a time

843
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
you can say i can save people or i can

844
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,600
save you company money

845
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
this is a really simple way this only

846
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,880
works in an additive sense like if i'm

847
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
trying to layer something in

848
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
take a manual process and take that into

849
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,840
something

850
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
with digital more automated

851
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
this is a calculator that works really

852
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,120
well if you're trying to justify

853
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
hiring

854
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,399
you can still do it with this calculator

855
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,679
but if you've gotten if you're trying to

856
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,000
do a riff this is not the calculator

857
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,080
that you should be using so

858
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,600
um

859
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
it's really

860
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,799
simplistic

861
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,080
but it is valuable because again

862
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,399
it starts that conversation with the cfo

863
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,640
it says to the cfo i am trying to speak

864
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
your language help me do that

865
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,360
and they will

866
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,559
but more valuable than that

867
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,039
are risk and recovery estimates this is

868
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,039
extremely simple much simpler than what

869
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,559
charlene was saying

870
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,919
but for 50 100 200 person organization

871
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,360
being able to say

872
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
hey if my internal applications are not

873
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
available

874
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,159
this is what it costs us in productivity

875
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,039
per hour per minute whatever

876
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,480
here is our net productivity lost to a

877
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
60 minute

878
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,399
60 minute instant

879
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,679
3 250 bucks doesn't sound like a lot

880
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,519
especially if we're talking about 100

881
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,840
000 person company but to a 50

882
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,480
non-profit that's a lot of money right

883
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,960
um incident response costs i think

884
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
adrian sinabria had originally posted

885
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,519
his version of just what an incident

886
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,919
cost your security team you can actually

887
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,080
map that not just to that security team

888
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,039
but to

889
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,519
the entire organization or the affected

890
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,720
organization

891
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,080
and then your recovery costs your

892
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,159
recovery costs become really important

893
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,720
again because of those operating costs

894
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,360
if i know my operating costs my risk or

895
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
the costs that put pressure on that and

896
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,799
make me spend money i wasn't planning to

897
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,200
spend your recovery cost

898
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,240
if you know you have a system that needs

899
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,760
to be changed

900
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,919
maybe it's legacy software this is what

901
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,919
the system is costing us here is the

902
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,240
risk of you know it getting reached

903
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,320
here's what it will cost us to move that

904
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,399
system somewhere else

905
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,480
now i can either plan for that cost for

906
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,880
next year right this is how you solve

907
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
some of that technical debt when they're

908
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,200
small and it's easy to solve

909
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,159
um

910
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,840
here's what it's going to cost

911
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,679
if we do it under pressure of an

912
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,000
incident right so

913
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,480
let's let's give people those tools uh

914
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,679
it also just sets that expectation on

915
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,880
there is a cost to not doing security if

916
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,519
you can get your cfo to buy into

917
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,760
there is a cost associated to not doing

918
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,480
security and you can say and if we do

919
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,320
that here's what it's going to cost you

920
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,559
can start building that security cost

921
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
into your budget

922
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
does that is that reasonable does that

923
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,320
sound reasonable

924
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,799
i've had one cso push back on this and

925
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,640
go attackers don't care about your

926
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
budget

927
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,519
you're gonna burn out because your ceo

928
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
cares about your budget a lot and yeah

929
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
your attackers don't care about a budget

930
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,919
or your roadmap or anything but

931
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,399
if you're going to your ceo and saying

932
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,760
well the attackers are going to do this

933
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,519
i need a hundred thousand dollars your

934
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
ceo is probably you're probably

935
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,960
frustrated because they're saying no if

936
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
you can put some numbers to that this is

937
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,840
what it's going to cost here as harleen

938
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
was saying here's the likelihood of an

939
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
attack

940
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,679
here's what it's going to cost you if it

941
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,799
happens

942
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,799
here's what it's going to cost you to

943
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,320
prevent it

944
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,640
you get a lot easier volume that

945
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
conversation becomes much more

946
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
collaborative and much less combative

947
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
right

948
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,799
if you're a sufficiently small company

949
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,639
if you're a 1500 company

950
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
one of the things that sometimes there's

951
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,159
still a hurdle they'll look at these and

952
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
they're like this is helpful we'll plan

953
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,559
it for next year

954
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,399
one of the conversations i end up having

955
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,320
with people is how often do you change

956
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,839
your laptops

957
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
and most organizations now accept that

958
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,918
technology moves fast enough that i need

959
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,199
to give

960
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,079
my

961
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,000
internal employees a new laptop every

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
three years

963
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,760
because the technology has changed or

964
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,239
it's just worn out so every three years

965
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
we just built that into our operating

966
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,079
cost and that's the important part

967
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,599
operating costs is expected right

968
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,359
if we just build that into our operating

969
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,839
costs we're fine okay well are you a mac

970
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,280
shop are you spending fifteen hundred

971
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,960
dollars every three years how about we

972
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,918
spend five hundred dollars per person

973
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,480
per year on your most basic security

974
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
tools

975
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
that makes them stop because it's like

976
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,918
i've just admitted that technology

977
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,280
changes and that i'm willing to do that

978
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,520
are you willing to spend as much money

979
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,599
as a laptop every three years to see you

980
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,240
through your small organization

981
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
that's a much

982
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,839
basic much more basic and simpler

983
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,160
conversation to have if you're not

984
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,240
especially if they don't have a cfo if

985
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
you're working with a client that's

986
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,240
small enough that your coo

987
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,400
is not from a cfo kind of background

988
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
they don't have the economic background

989
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,220
or the finance background

990
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,320
[Music]

991
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,240
you might have to change tactics there

992
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,359
that conversation

993
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,359
becomes very successful because once you

994
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,359
can get them to say all right you're a

995
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,800
small organization you're gonna spend

996
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
500 a year let's talk about what we can

997
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,160
get you for that

998
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
now you've grown a little bit now you've

999
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,599
gotten a little more

1000
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,560
you know

1001
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,359
more investors maybe um maybe you've got

1002
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,880
a little more revenue

1003
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,960
being reliably generated let's talk

1004
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,200
about upping upping that

1005
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,520
from my experience and this is purely

1006
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,960
anecdotal

1007
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
if you're a hundred person company you

1008
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,839
should be spending a thousand dollars

1009
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,520
per person per year on security

1010
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
as you get bigger that number drops

1011
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
because there's an economy of scale

1012
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,960
that's why enterprises can afford to do

1013
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,880
their own stuff but if you're a very

1014
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,520
small company i love to see spend a

1015
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
thousand dollars ahead just secure your

1016
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,280
organization and build that into your

1017
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
operating cost model if i can get you to

1018
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,000
spend 500 ahead that's still a win

1019
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,520
um if you're trying to talk me down to

1020
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
250 ahead maybe i don't need to be

1021
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,040
working for you anymore because there's

1022
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,560
not much you can do there

1023
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
yeah there's a lot of things that you

1024
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,160
can talk about here's how we're gonna

1025
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
spend our time for the first few months

1026
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,320
securing the pieces that you have now

1027
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
but once you've gotten the basics locked

1028
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
down

1029
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
now you do have to have those money

1030
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,160
conversations on no really i do need

1031
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,720
i do need i do need

1032
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,880
maybe you need for a small organization

1033
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
something of an article for expel

1034
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,960
security as a service knock center sock

1035
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,640
as a service that kind of thing

1036
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
there's a lot of things that you can do

1037
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,839
by playing with numbers

1038
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,400
um

1039
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,160
oh my timer just

1040
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,200
okay

1041
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,040
um we're doing pretty good

1042
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,000
so

1043
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
are there any questions at this point

1044
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,680
has anyone had an experience where

1045
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,440
they're trying to set up a program do

1046
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,720
you want me to go more on the

1047
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,000
operational side of the health model

1048
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,079
are we good i know this is a lot of like

1049
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,520
really high level really boring

1050
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
information but

1051
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,880
i know this is interesting you like

1052
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,680
yeah yeah it's really simple sure

1053
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,560
have you seen one of those

1054
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,079
things

1055
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,240
i saw it one time that i just kind of

1056
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,000
lost that link so i never saw it again

1057
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
um usually i haven't seen it as a how do

1058
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
i pet it uh

1059
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
free to the world here's what you do x y

1060
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,240
and z i'm sure there are guides out

1061
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,479
there

1062
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,160
usually an msp is trying to bake all of

1063
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,440
that in as part of their service

1064
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,680
offering so it becomes a sales pitch

1065
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
that's how i usually see it

1066
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
uh most of the clients yeah and it's

1067
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
interesting because we're not cheap

1068
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
i'll be really trying for 100 person

1069
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
company you're spending

1070
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,680
80 to 100 000 for my company to help

1071
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,440
guide you through security

1072
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,599
can you get a vc so a solo practitioner

1073
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,280
cheaper

1074
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
sure they're 400 an hour

1075
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,040
um but if you only need five hours a

1076
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,880
month that's great

1077
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,400
if you're willing to do the hands-on

1078
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
work and i think there are a lot of a

1079
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,880
lot of the ctos that i that i work with

1080
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,960
are willing to do the hands-on work they

1081
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
just don't know where to start or they

1082
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
don't have time to sift through all the

1083
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,079
information and figure out what's

1084
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,160
actually useful for them that's really

1085
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
what they're coming to us for

1086
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,760
because we don't like i said we're

1087
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,000
purely strategic or purely advisory we

1088
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,920
don't do any hands-on work

1089
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,839
and what they're trying to do is save

1090
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,920
that vp of engineering with that cto and

1091
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,839
that cm is time

1092
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,599
and learning security

1093
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,119
because they know that

1094
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
it's just gonna happen a lot faster

1095
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
so there are lots of things and even we

1096
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,960
have blogs we write blogs every week

1097
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
on here's what you do small business

1098
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,240
here you know

1099
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,680
you want to understand the difference

1100
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
between sock 2 compliance vendors here's

1101
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,480
a white paper if you want to understand

1102
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
what's better gmail or what's better for

1103
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,760
security gmail or o365 and it's not

1104
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
microsoft

1105
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,400
gee um wonder why um yeah we have a lot

1106
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
of blogs we do put a lot of that

1107
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,280
information out there a lot of

1108
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,119
consulting agencies do because it's part

1109
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,640
of our brand

1110
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,480
but the amount of time that it takes

1111
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,079
someone to read through all of that and

1112
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,160
decide what's relevant to them it's

1113
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
cheaper for them to come to us or

1114
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,359
somebody else right

1115
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,240
so

1116
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,599
does that does that answer the question

1117
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
yeah okay

1118
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,720
um

1119
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,960
but speaking of such things i do have

1120
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,040
some tools and suggestions

1121
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
actually if you i will come back to this

1122
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,599
if you download this there's actually

1123
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,560
several

1124
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,680
several uh tabs that have different loss

1125
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
recovery estimates depending on

1126
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,359
like if you're looking at infrastructure

1127
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,839
or if you are a service provider with a

1128
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,800
subscription model great but the last

1129
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,960
two tabs on the on this worksheet

1130
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,319
actually have

1131
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,440
links to useful information number one

1132
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,920
like the fbi and sofos reports yearly

1133
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,079
reports that kind of thing and summarize

1134
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,839
some of the kind of

1135
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,760
the numbers that i look at on a regular

1136
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,960
basis

1137
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,839
it also has links to a lot of open

1138
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,160
source software

1139
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,599
um

1140
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
i'm a big fan of security onion i know

1141
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,760
those guys they worked with them at

1142
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
mandiak they're pretty awesome um

1143
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240
security onions free it's not a sim but

1144
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,359
it's about as close as you're going to

1145
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,440
get to assume for free

1146
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,599
if you've got more time then you have

1147
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,400
money

1148
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,440
open source is a really good option

1149
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,480
i think the problem is that most teams

1150
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,960
don't they're so time constrained that

1151
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,599
they have to spend money right if you're

1152
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,200
in an organization that has enough more

1153
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,079
embodies like a university you see a lot

1154
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,599
more open source use if you're a

1155
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,160
developer or you have a large

1156
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,480
organization that has

1157
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
warm bodies it's cheaper for them to

1158
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
take open source stuff and build out

1159
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
their own stuff

1160
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,720
that's great

1161
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,480
if you are a small or mid-sized company

1162
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,040
that's usually not an option unless you

1163
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,079
just have someone who's really

1164
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,760
passionate about it willing to do it

1165
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,599
outside of their regular work because at

1166
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,520
the end of the day the time that they

1167
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,440
spend doing this

1168
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
is not time they're spending on

1169
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,560
producing your product which is how you

1170
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,040
generate revenue and when you're sub 100

1171
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,160
people

1172
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
that becomes super focused that is your

1173
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,400
focus you're trying to generate the

1174
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,560
revenue so that you can keep people

1175
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
so

1176
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,640
there are lots of

1177
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,800
things out there fire eye well it's not

1178
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
fire anymore it's trellis i should go

1179
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,079
and check and see if they still have

1180
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,160
that they used to have a lot of freeware

1181
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,359
that was originally developed by

1182
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,119
mandiants before we purchased the

1183
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,119
indians um

1184
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,640
things like redline and that sort of

1185
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,520
thing really great resources free i

1186
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,880
don't know if they're maintaining it

1187
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
anymore i don't know if mandiant's taken

1188
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,119

1189
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,400

was losing them uh two hundred thousand

1224
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,720
dollars a day because facebook ads

1225
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
weren't running um

1226
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
i have had some interest yeah i mean

1227
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,480
there's some really great

1228
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,000
people out there trying to do really

1229
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
great stuff but then you realize they're

1230
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,440
really built on

1231
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,319
uh

1232
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,319
gum and shoestrings right so had a

1233
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,720
customer last week come to me and say

1234
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,920
hey you know

1235
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,000
we're we need to migrate our aws

1236
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,400
accounts from uh somebody's you know

1237
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,560
from an email address to

1238
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,400
to another one do we need to use our

1239
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,359
main

1240
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,319
domain

1241
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,160
or should we use some other domain so

1242
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,240
because if our domain gets compromised

1243
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,520
you know then they have access to our

1244
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,920
ews am i overthinking this and of course

1245
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,839
my first question is why are you moving

1246
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,760
your aws accounts from one account you

1247
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,359
know email address to another and it's

1248
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,200
because when they set those up

1249
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,720
uh they were set up on somebody's

1250
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
personal email address which

1251
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,040
right

1252
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,119
this was a friday afternoon at 4 30

1253
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,560
questions so

1254
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,680
you know

1255
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,720
it's like

1256
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
well you know and when you're doing your

1257
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
gap assessment you're here i need you to

1258
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,440
be here that's not a question you asked

1259
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,000
where is your aws account owned who owns

1260
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,079
that what's the root account email

1261
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,920
address there that's not something you

1262
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,319
think to ask yeah so they're

1263
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,640
really entertaining um

1264
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,520
i have had i i think prospect calls was

1265
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,599
fun for me because i actually got a

1266
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,520
talking to a prospective client and they

1267
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,280

1268
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,800
forensics team they got everything

1269
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
cleaned up they were very confident that

1270
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,359
the people were out that they felt like

1271
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,880
it's clear we need a cyber security

1272
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
program and you cannot help you you know

1273

1275
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,160

1282
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,119

1283
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,359
bad about it but but the guy's like yeah

1284
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
you can laugh i've only been here three

1285
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,119
months i'm the new cpa this is

1286
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,800
one of the things i need to clean up he

1287
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
did become a client and they were very

1288
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,720
entertaining my clients were using

1289
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,200
technology in ways i wasn't expecting

1290
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,440
um i had it when i first joined

1291
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,960
fractional css on my first client

1292
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,400
they're like it's a marketing services

1293
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,839
firm and i'm like oh that's going to be

1294
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,640
a nice easy client they are the most

1295
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,880
complicated client i have they have the

1296
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,000
most complex environment got 250 domains

1297
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,720
they've got 60 aws accounts they have

1298
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,680
things in aws they have things in gcp

1299
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,839
we are not charging them

1300
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,720
frank they are really doing stuff that i

1301
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,800
was not expecting because what they're

1302
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,280
doing is they're basically doing online

1303
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,160
advertising for universities but they so

1304
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,400
they've got that kind of marketing model

1305
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,760
but where they're really making their

1306
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,720
money now is that they go okay if this

1307
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,480
student comes to us

1308
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,160
you know we're not going to charge you

1309
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,440
for the click

1310
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,800
we're going to take a percentage of

1311
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,200
their tuition right the entire time that

1312
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,720
they're enrolled but we're going to make

1313
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,119
it beneficial to the student they

1314
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,119
actually have basically a call center

1315
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,119
that is a whiteboard call center for any

1316
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,960
of the students that are enrolled

1317
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,160
through having come through their

1318
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
marketing programs so if that student

1319
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,520
has a problem

1320
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,839
with getting their financial aid

1321
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,440
this company will actually call the

1322
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,920
bursar's office and go hey

1323

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,800
online auctions for a lot of at auctions

1329
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,880
so like soft abuse is the one that

1330
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,559
everyone knows it's not necessarily

1331
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,559
their client but you know when soccer

1332
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,319
these cuisines whatever

1333
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,079
has an in-person live bidding option

1334
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,400
and then you'll hear so and so from

1335
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,559
online we have a bid from the online

1336
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,800
auction this is one of the like four

1337
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,720
companies in the world that do that

1338
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,160
um

1339
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,800
they have taken with the pandemic

1340
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,119
they've taken their physical locations

1341
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,240
and now you can actually bring the

1342
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
artwork to them they will scan it

1343
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
and they will not only scan it to

1344
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,559
produce the online image for the

1345
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,440
auctions they will mention nfp as a part

1346
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,440
of the providence so if you have the art

1347
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,839
and you have the nft you own the art if

1348
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,440
you have the art but you don't have the

1349
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,839
nft maybe the art is stolen

1350
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,599
and that is like the first time i've

1351
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,640
actually

1352
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,599
heard of nft is used in a useful way but

1353
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,920
it's time confidence of a physical

1354
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,240
object right um

1355
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
i have clients yeah like i said i've got

1356
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,000
a security client they are doing

1357
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,599
interesting things but if i talk about

1358
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,319
it and figure out who they are um

1359
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,119
what else have i got i've got a client

1360
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,319
that does

1361
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,680
you know if you go to a dealership

1362
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,800
website

1363
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,200
you can like spin the car on the

1364
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,680
dealership website like the 360 models

1365
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,800
of the car

1366
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,960
they do that that is the only thing they

1367
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,839
do

1368
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,520
for dealership websites that's their

1369
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,079
whole and they're like 60 70 people

1370
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,119
right

1371
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,640
that's that's great for them they're

1372
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,040
expanding in other areas but it wasn't

1373
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,800
they're actually they bought and just

1374
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,319
bought a company

1375
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,480
um out of eastern europe

1376
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,079

1377
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,680
somewhere near ukraine

1378
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,920
so talking as i'm doing the the secure

1379
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,440
lifecycle development uh secure

1380
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,079
life yeah secure software

1381
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,680
life cycle

1382
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,200
assessment

1383
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,520
uh and i'm talking to this this team in

1384
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,680
the country of georgia just as the

1385
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,520
ukraine is starting

1386
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,200
and so like the first 10 minutes of our

1387
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,800
conversation are always you know the

1388
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,160
first actually the first 10 minutes of

1389
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,839
the first conversation is like how did

1390
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,079
you get into this business oh well in

1391
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,040
2014 i was uh tracking russian

1392
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,520
misinformation campaigns that guy's cool

1393
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,200
talk to you nothing to do with our

1394
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,040
product but he's really cool to talk to

1395
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,119
you so getting to talk to somebody like

1396
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,079
that i was not expecting to like my

1397
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,640
clients and enjoy actually talking about

1398
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,599
clients as much as i do yeah you know

1399
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,839
you don't get to pick your clients like

1400
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,839
it's whoever signs the contract and

1401
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,520
they're like you're up next

1402
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,040
you know so

1403
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,599
when you get that it it has really

1404
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,440
surprised and delighted me how lucky

1405
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,599
i've been with the clients that i've

1406
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,440
gotten they're all very cool they're

1407
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,119
doing something neat sometimes they're

1408
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,800
doing something they're doing

1409
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,880
interesting things with technology to do

1410
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,640
things that you weren't expecting like

1411
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,760
the client itself hair care products

1412
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,839
really not interesting to me as you can

1413
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,559
tell my hair's a mess i don't care about

1414
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,240
the hair care products but what you're

1415
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,160
doing to sell the hair care products on

1416
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,720
their ecommerce site that's interesting

1417
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,440
e-commerce is a really different bag too

1418
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,760
from a security model because you know

1419
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,880
your end client your your consumer

1420
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,319
doesn't care if you're sought too

1421
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,440
compliant they really only kind of care

1422
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,400
if

1423
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,920
you're secure at all

1424
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,680
and that you know maybe their credit

1425
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,200
cards will get popped but if that

1426
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,520
happens that always happens no big deal

1427
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,200
we've kind of we've become

1428
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,280
consumers are important to that so they

1429
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,119
have actually a lower bar so if you're

1430
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,880
an e-commerce site coming to me actually

1431
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,960
wanting to do security i actually had to

1432
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,359
kind of go good job your cto actually

1433
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,920
seems to care um

1434
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,200
but

1435
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
you know when you you have to treat them

1436
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,920
a little bit differently so we ran some

1437
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,359
fans and said hey

1438
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,440
you've got some open s3 buckets you know

1439
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,760
they should be public you know and they

1440
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,319
looked down no no i said no oh you don't

1441
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,800
care okay well here's a risk register

1442
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
here's what the problem is here's what

1443
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
we recommend um

1444
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,720
sign that you accept that risk i want

1445
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,720
you to put your name on that cto and

1446
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,480
then all of a sudden he cared like when

1447
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,119
i made him when i wanted him to sign off

1448
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,760
on this suddenly it's like

1449
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,880
give me two days to research

1450
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,000
so

1451
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
it's it's very

1452
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,359
interesting kind of the different

1453
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,680
personalities you get like i said i'm

1454
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,520
dealing with ctas cfos vps

1455
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,760
the cfos are very much about the risk

1456
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
they get it they're on top of that risk

1457
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,520
the technology doesn't necessarily make

1458
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,720
sense to them

1459
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,760
but if you again if you can learn to

1460
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,319
talk and risk you can get a lot more

1461
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,800
done with securing a small organization

1462
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,520
so

1463
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,920
i think those are the most entertaining

1464
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,720
discussions i can have without

1465
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,399
ruining client confidentiality

1466
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,920
any other uh we've got five minutes left

1467
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,839
and i'm happy to call it there for no

1468
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,559
other questions

1469
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,359
good

1470
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,960
all right go get water before the

1471
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,180
keynote

1472
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:26,509
[Applause]
