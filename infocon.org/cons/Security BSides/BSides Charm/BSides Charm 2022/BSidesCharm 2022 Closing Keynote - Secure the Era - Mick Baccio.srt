1
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,119
make sure i got all these things good

2
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,480
morning everyone

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
uh thanks for coming i know it's super

4
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,120
early i'm gonna move away from this

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
uh so let's get started

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,160
the title is secure the era there was a

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,920
guy i used to work for named pete buddha

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
judge his campaign slogan was win the

9
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
era this would have made more sense two

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
years ago that's going to be an ongoing

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,960
theme just bear with me this morning all

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,800
right

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
so

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
before we get started it's 2022 this is

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,800
not 2020. uh

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,559
campaign's over with

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,600
you know

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
like a lot of things this is kind of

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,680
dated information we're kind of a time

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
capsule uh but i think it's relevant now

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
it's relevant more so in two years so

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
like me like many things it's so much

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
cooler two years ago

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
uh for also fun facts some more

25
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
housekeeping i'm super colorblind like

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
really i see a 12.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
and that's really it um so there's like

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
some real primary colors going on all

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
right uh fun fact i joined the navy and

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
i was supposed to be a nuclear engineer

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
and this lady walks in and she's like

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
hey no

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
uh it's not gonna happen

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
so your file says you're good at

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,240
computers and i was like we're gonna go

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,520
with that and here we are

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,640
so

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
uh i figured i'd break this down into

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
four parts make it pretty easy pretty

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
digestible uh first we'll start off with

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,040
like why am i here who am i uh what it's

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
like to be a campaign ceo in a

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
presidential campaign uh talk about 2020

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,439
a little bit and i might be a downer and

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
then finish off with uh dana ma

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
so

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
oops all right

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
oh no the formatting is gone

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160

random stuff been doing this for a super

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640

uh career-wise like i said most my time

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
in the federal government

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,200
a company called splunk some of you

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
might have heard of on a research group

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,159
called surge

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,159
uh so yeah that's a lot of work a lot of

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,360
government stuff mostly in the threat

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
intelligence wheelhouse uh but cyber's

86
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
know hopefully it will take you there

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,239
too

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
so we're gonna focus mostly on this area

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
like when i was at the white house um i

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,959
kind of got there in october of 2015.

92
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
everything leading up to the 2016

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
election uh

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
the inauguration the transition and a

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,959
year and a half in the trump

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
administration and then my time with the

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,840
buddha judge campaign and then 2020

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,280
where like all the elections happen and

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
there was no problems and here we are

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
now uh so yeah

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
side note uh i did work at the white

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
house and remember this when secretary

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
sean spicer tweeted out what looked like

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,040
his password at the time so

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
i get to work and i get caught over the

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
west wing and the person tells me hey

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
mick this intel's an hour old i'm like

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
all right oh i'm sorry it's an hour and

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
15 minutes old because it took you 15

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
minutes to get over here and i'm like oh

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,480
it's one of those converse i'm tracking

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
i got it

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
i need you to call air force one and i'm

114
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
like i what

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
dialed nine first or like how do you do

116
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
that um

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
so you know this happens when you find

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
out what's going on you need to get to

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
the bottom of this and i'm like that's

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
not really threat intelligence right

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,040
threat intelligence is stacking actors

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
this is somebody doing something stupid

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,919
more than likely

124
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,280
um

125
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
and

126
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,800
so you know end up calling air force one

127
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
hey i need to speak to uh mr spicer he's

128
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
with the media right now do you want me

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,040
interrupted i'm like what no the branch

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
chief of a threat intelligence team does

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
not need to interrupt the press

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
secretary while he's on air force one

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
talking to the media please don't do

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
that um

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
so long day plans in atlanta we get to

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,160
the bottom of it and all that to say you

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
dial nine first all right and then

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
but you know a job like that um you know

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919
layla talked what a campaign was like

140
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,280
that high pressure high intensity

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,680
environment be ready for anything uh

142
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,039
that's what working at the white house

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
was like so

144
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,120
when i quit uh i know that's not really

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
a linear transition and and and you know

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
and i didn't quit because of that i quit

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,639
like a much longer time later but

148
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,840
there's a lot of stuff i really can't

149
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,199
talk about so we're just not going to

150
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,720
talk about it

151
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,680
sorry

152
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
so

153
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,400
i want to be a campaign ceso um

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
sure why not right well well real quick

155
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,520
uh

156
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,759
show our hands who are applause who has

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
worked on a political campaign anybody

158
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,039
awesome austin you're the man

159
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,560
uh all right so there's this guy pete

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
buddha judge and i had to google how to

161
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
pronounce his name because i just did

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
not know uh but when you go to his

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
campaign headquarters like boot edge

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,320
edge is written on the wall pretty big

165
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
so it's pretty easy

166
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
so before i took the job i'll be honest

167

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
i don't know how campaigns work uh i

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,720
don't know how elections work uh a

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
caucus like i knew it was this thing in

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
iowa where there's tape on the floor and

172
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,800
like where you stand on the tape is who

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,160
you put your vote for and i'm like

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
that's how we choose our president in

175
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
america

176
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,319
uh election day is on a tuesday because

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
can't have it on sunday i gotta travel

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,759
on monday but not too late in the season

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
because the crops come in that's right

180
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
crops that's that's our system um

181
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
so really i learned so much about it in

182
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
that time but i kind of walked in and

183
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
hey i know all these other things you

184
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,800
know i've done vip executive protection

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400

know they're kind of secure um you know

188
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
and then i i thought about i was like

189
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
this is such a unique job a campaign is

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
so unique it's i got a call one day and

191
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400

uh you heard all the things yesterday

195
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,240
right campaigns don't pay well at all

196
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
it's a very very temporal job either you

197

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,039

202
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,880

this article came out

224
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,000
so like i um most of my career has been

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,400
on the classified side of things right i

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
just do secret squirrel stuff it's kind

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
of my background i've been real big on

228
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,680
my privacy right and then this hey this

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
mig is this guy coming out oops um let

230
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,879
me go back when

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
so just came out and there was privacy

232
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
it was super awesome

233
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,639
but you know uh and then on reddit

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,680
fat cat in tight places endorsed me so

235
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,879
like i don't

236
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
can't get any better than that

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
so let's talk a bit about that campaign

238
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
a political campaign at you know a

239
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
presidential level even lower level it's

240
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
a for-profit company it's incorporation

241
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,639
all right it has its own tax code the

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
fec is a separate tax law for it it

243
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
sells items of no value uh for donations

244
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
so it's funded entirely by donation and

245
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,279
its sole purpose is to elect its mascot

246
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,080
president uh and and i say mascot

247
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
because and it's not a negative way for

248
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
the most part um

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,959
it's not a ceo right your your candidate

250
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
is not the ceo of this campaign it's

251
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
completely detached and it's not like a

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
board of directors either where you know

253
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
it has some kind of

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
involvement in day-to-day operations

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
that's not what a candidate does a

256
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
candidate does exactly what you see a

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
candidate do on tv run for president so

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
and the other thing

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
this job might end tomorrow anything can

260
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,399
go wrong you don't raise money you're

261
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,240
out of a job you say something stupid on

262
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
tv you're out of a job um perfect

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,240
example

264
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
anyone remember this it was a long time

265
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
ago

266
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
2004 howard dean gave a speech to a lot

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
of people he's going to the white house

268
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,440
we're going to d.c

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
yeah and then like i had friends who

270
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
worked on that campaign were in the room

271
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
when he said it and they're like well

272
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,180
done here

273
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,040
[Laughter]

274
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
uh fun fact about that

275
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
so we some of you have seen the clip

276
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,240
heard the audio

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
the initial recording of it his voice

278
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
was not that scream

279
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
someone took the audio lowered the rest

280
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
of it and raised just the end and that's

281
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
the part that went viral that video is

282
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,880
went

283
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
viral so

284
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,560
sorry bro we gonna do right

285
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
um

286
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
so let's talk about

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,279
campaigns in general all right so you

288
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,959
have election infrastructure your voting

289
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,320
machines your voting systems everything

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
like that that's

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
covered under eic influence operations

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
you see a lot about that now because you

293
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
know it's the new hotness so those are

294
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
things that are covered under the

295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,720
election assistance commission uh those

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,640
are things that are covered under cesa's

297
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
definition of election security

298
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,279
campaigns aren't

299
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
there's no there's no oversight so

300
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
you know it's a

301
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
the distinction between these i don't

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
think is made enough okay

303
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
there's no oversight in a campaign so

304
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,399
all of you uh that work in the field now

305
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
who's ever been audited like who knows

306
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
what fisma is or security scorecard i

307
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
know i made all of you sad just saying

308
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
that all right i work on a campaign i

309
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
don't have to do that i don't have to

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,720
follow anything

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
uh and the problem becomes because this

312
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
is such a temporal job

313
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,680
is the juice worth the squeeze and and

314
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,720
that's what you're going to run into

315
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
chip had a good point yesterday where it

316
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,200
was

317
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
uh

318
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
hey you want to be secure we all want

319
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,399
things to be secure but when you impact

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
operations

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
it's not going to let you do it this

322
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,560
can't happen

323
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
so you know that that's a very very big

324
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
thing so the other two i don't know as

325
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,079
well i know cyber security been doing it

326
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
for so long so all right let's do this

327
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,519
let's put this in a campaign what's that

328
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,480
look like

329
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
uh

330
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,040
campaigns generally there is no security

331
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,600
culture right uh 2016 we saw the things

332
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,519
that happened with hillary for america

333
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
with john podesta with the dnc the

334
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
d-trip everything like that um

335
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
that it you think there's more security

336
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
inside of it but security is a cost

337
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
center just like your job so if i'm

338
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
trying to every vote

339
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,680
every dollar i spend on you is a dollar

340
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,320
i don't spend on votes in iowa that's

341
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
just the way it goes

342
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,560
so

343
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,800
creating security on a real budget on a

344
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,839
real temporal thing is super hard to do

345
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,120
so you're creating a culture like heavy

346
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
on the cult part right

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
think of who this staffer is and

348
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
i'm trying really hard not to be scary

349
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,519
most your campaign staffers are either

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,760
first job out of college or second job

351
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
out of college and the first job was on

352
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,959
a campaign all right so

353
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,800
i've been doing super

354
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
threat intelligence type stuff for the

355
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
past decade of my life and i'm sitting

356
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
down with some 20 year old like hey

357
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,760
russia going to get you um

358
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
and i really felt bad there was one time

359
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
i gave a speech

360
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,639
my training the whole team because

361
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
when you aren't a campaign you can't do

362
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
one to one you try to as much as you can

363
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,639
do one-to-one with principals uh but

364
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,920
with the entire teams the entire

365
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,279
campaigns you're doing an entire broad

366
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
message right the training we all go

367
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,240
through it's kind of like that

368
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,079
so i'm doing it and there was this cat

369
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
named ian malue who was in a leak dc

370
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,880
leaks back in 2016.

371
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,079
talked about him a bit and said oh

372
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,480
that's my friend ian and i'm like oh no

373
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
i'm sorry i don't mean to rag on your

374
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,279
friend but has he heard a multi-factor

375
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,959
spoiler he did not so

376
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
when you talk about a campaign all right

377
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
so a political campaign is is a lot like

378
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,160
a lot of businesses you you

379
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,839
work with now but it's entirely

380
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,680
different because each has its own fund

381
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
and pillar so you have principal ops

382
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
principal ops is your um your candidate

383
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,959
candidate's family

384
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
immediate staff so for me you know i

385
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
think uh peter judge think his husband

386
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
his mom the immediate close members you

387
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
want to lock them down those are the

388
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,639
folks that have the tightest level of

389
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
security think of when you do a crown

390
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
jewels assessment now like your ring

391
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
zero stuff you need to protect that's

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
what you need to look at first after

393
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
that your policy folks policy folks are

394
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,240
going to get targeted because if i want

395
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,839
to know what your candidate is thinking

396
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,760
i'm going to steal their work all right

397
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
that's just how it goes

398
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,720
finance is the money media control the

399
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
message investment

400
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,399
it's

401
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,120
campaigns are really really money

402
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
is so fast all the time think about how

403
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
much money when you've seen this on the

404
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
news when a candidate raises 30 million

405
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
dollars in a month all right cool we got

406
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
30 million dollars well no actually you

407
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
don't um the problem with that becomes

408
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,760
when you go out in the vendor space

409
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,800
you're like hey i need to do this

410
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,880
solution oh we saw you have 30 million

411
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,399
dollars you're like oh that's adorable

412
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,639
you think that goes to me it's no it's

413
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,560
to iowa votes

414
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,120
uh data and data is a very very big

415
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,320
problem i think in all the campaigns we

416
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
deal with every time it's data is a very

417
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
very nebulous ecosystem behind

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
everything we'll get into um and again

419
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
they don't pay well so you're not

420
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,199
getting like the sharpest and brightest

421
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
you just get who wants to believe in

422
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
this candidate and help them win so each

423
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,440
of these departments inside of a

424
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,279
campaign has a security story and your

425
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
job just like it is now is to tell that

426
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
story

427
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
so

428
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
supply chain we can't have a cyber talk

429
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,360
without talking about supply chain right

430
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,560
it's kind of our thing the past two

431
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,519
years

432
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,360
so when you were on a campaign and i was

433
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,720
on a democratic campaign so i can't

434
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
really speak to uh what where what a gop

435
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
side is like i imagine it's exactly the

436
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,760
same

437
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
so you have everything pretty much in

438
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,240
the cloud then you rely on an ecosystem

439
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,440
things like the civist act blue ngp van

440
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,199
these are kind of back-end databases

441
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,720
that are hosted by third parties you log

442
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
into for information uh there was a

443
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,279
thing that happened back in

444
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,560
2016 which i get it where senator

445
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,360
sanders campaign accessed the voter data

446
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
of then secretary clinton um and if any

447
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,839
of that you know oh you can't use this

448
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
data for two weeks so that was the

449
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
penalty for it but the problem becomes

450
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,360
you know this information when you

451
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
download it from these uh these vendors

452
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,199
if that gets out it's kind of on you if

453
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
that data is manipulated it's kind of on

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
you if one of these vendors gets

455
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
compromised that's a downstream effect

456
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
so i'm sure we've all seen things like

457
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
that in our day jobs

458
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
so uh canvassing data you know that's

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
also a really really big thing that's

460
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
your door knockers uh trying to get

461
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
folks to vote through real targeted real

462
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
targeted demographics that you're going

463
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
for every day

464
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
and

465
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
another aspect consider when you're

466
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
doing security is the gamesmanship so

467
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,199
someone registered pete buddhajudge.org

468
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,440
and when you went to that it redirected

469
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,680
you to donald j trump.com which we

470
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,360
directed you to his campaign website

471
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
like

472
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,440
what are you going to do right this is

473
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
how it goes right

474
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
um if you remember the debates when

475
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
president biden said hey text joe 30 30

476
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
and he misspoke someone registered that

477
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,440
domain and pointed it to pete for

478
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
america which

479
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,399
that's just part of the game like if you

480
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
didn't do it fast enough we see it all

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
the time

482
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,880
uh so that's not really malicious right

483
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,399
i mean i don't i care but i don't really

484
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
care that much unless you're having to

485
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
go to like some really foul website and

486
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,120
i'm like oh i gotta do something about

487
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
that uh and then it becomes important

488
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
your relationships with those cloud

489
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
providers with those uh with those

490
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
registrars because

491
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
we've all tried to take down a domain

492
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
how long does that take is it an hour is

493
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
there a day like we don't have that kind

494
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
of time of the campaign

495
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
so

496
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,079
spoof domains like this is something we

497
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,639
all know way too much about run dns

498
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
twist on pete for america and let me

499
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
know what comes back when i did this

500
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
there were 525

501
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
i

502
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
i have a staff minimal at a campaign

503
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,360
you're gonna do the same thing we talked

504
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
about what funding is like you just

505
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
don't have that kind of staff you wear

506
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
so many hats so

507
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
i hope they're not bad those 18 uh are

508
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
they registered they send in mail like

509
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,679
what are you gonna do so it's something

510
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,880
you keep an eye on and you try and

511
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
leverage that ecosystem as much as

512
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
possible but like we all know nothing

513
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,559
happened bad from spook domain ever so

514
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,359
we're good we're good

515
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,760
uh supporters and optics

516
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
is another

517
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
you know big big area to consider and

518
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
this isn't really the information side

519
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,440
of it it's kind of close though

520
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,799
um

521
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
you know your your people that are

522
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
supporters of your campaign

523
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
you don't want to piss them off right so

524
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
let's say that uh

525
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,559
you know you're a fan of campaign you

526
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
open up a website you're selling

527
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
t-shirts you know you're selling bumper

528
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
stickers but i didn't make those those

529
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
aren't official like peak for america

530
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
ones they're not official campaign ones

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
that's copyright that's brand that's you

532
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
know so what do you do do you shut it

533
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
down like do you go tell one of your

534
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,080
your

535
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,919
campaign supporters hey bro

536
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,480
i can't have you doing that um so that's

537
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
a really really big problem

538
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
and all those things on the right

539
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
like the buddha judge campaign yeah that

540
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,760
was his account or his account the rest

541
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
of those are unofficial ones so you kind

542
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
of got to play that balancing act if it

543
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,760
gets too loud you got to do something it

544
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,039
doesn't get loud enough you don't really

545
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,400
care it's the same thing we deal every

546
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,919
day

547
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
so

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,400
has anyone here ever donated money to a

549
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
political campaign or to the dnc or

550
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,039
all right are you still on that mailing

551
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,919
list

552
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
yeah all right um

553
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,960
sucks

554
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
so the problem becomes on a campaign i'm

555
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
trying to reach as many people as

556
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
possible right i'm trying to

557
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,080
uh

558
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,679
you know get my message out to everyone

559
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,360
let them know who my candidate is and

560
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,960
also it all comes down to money we need

561
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
money so please donate some money

562
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,200
kind of like

563
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
spam kind of like

564
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,919
every bec email you deal with every day

565
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,440
there are campaigns that have gotten

566
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,600
caught in things like spam house

567
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
and like you're going there like we're

568
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,480
gonna do like hey no we're just trying

569
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
to ask for money from people strangers

570
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
no what i meant was we're trying to

571
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
raise funds for a guy who doesn't matter

572
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
so

573
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
you know that's gonna be an ongoing

574
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
thing and i mentioned like who's donated

575
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
to a campaign before because once you've

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
donated and you try and unsubscribe from

577
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
that mailing list it's just i've never

578
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
been able to and it's been on over 12

579
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
years

580
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,559
um but yeah

581
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,080
i'm not saying campaigns are bad for

582
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,850
doing that but like

583
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,559
[Music]

584
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,120
remember this

585
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,600
this is jeb bush 2016.

586
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
he

587
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
so he gave a speech in florida he said i

588
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
will not trash talk i will not be a

589
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,600
divider in chief or an agitator in chief

590
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
i won't be blow harding talk a big game

591
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,760
without backing it up

592
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
i think the next president needs to be a

593
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
lot quieter but send a signal we're

594
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,840
prepared and to act in the national

595
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
security interest of the country to get

596
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,679
back in the business of creating a more

597
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,880
peaceful world

598
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
it's pretty good right

599
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,799
so jeff bush said this to a room full of

600
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,080
people and he thought hey man that's

601
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,039
pretty good

602
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,679
nobody clapped nope there's kind of like

603
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,919
this this is good and then he

604
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,679
said please clap

605
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,120
and um

606
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
i don't know if you've ever talked in

607
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
front of a crowd or told a joke or

608
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
anything like that but uh

609
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
if you have to ask people to it's like

610
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,919
explaining a joke jason you're with me

611
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,200
right like you explain a joke it's not

612
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,559
really a joke at that point you're just

613
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,240
ah and then shortly after jeb was

614
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,280
dropped out

615
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080

campaign gets mail and uh when i first

628
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600

doing anywhere else right you want to

663
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
get people engaged in security which is

664
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
really hard to do because we're a super

665
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,080
pedantic bunch and we kind of let the

666
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400
perfect be the enemy the good a lot and

667
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
it's not a bad thing i guess but it kind

668
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,200
of is a bad thing when you come across

669
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
like a jerk and people just ignore you

670
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
um

671
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,000
educate people like we work in a pretty

672
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
technical field and my friend ryan likes

673
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
to make this analogy of wizards and

674
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
muggles and i don't mean in a mean way

675
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
but like we do a lot we do something

676
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
that a lot of people in the world can't

677
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
do and don't want to do and don't care

678
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
about so

679
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
like no one cared about the plumbing in

680
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
rome till it stopped working

681
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
so security is the same way um

682
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,159
and encourage people like we all screwed

683
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,640
up i have made so many mistakes in my

684
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,000
career

685
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
and then just you know

686
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,440
it's it's

687
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,200
teach people that it's nothing bad

688
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,480
what's the worst thing that can happen

689
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,919
oh we lost some data we lost the

690
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
computer i get it right it's not the end

691
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,039
of the world but let's try and make that

692
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,520
not happen um and just how to be secure

693
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
most folks they're not against it they

694
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
just don't know again this is like first

695
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,840
job at of college second job out of

696
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
college real real young just i get all

697
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,520
these things like why why is it a threat

698
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
for me

699
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,760
um

700
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,520
and and your job is to kind of encourage

701
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,760
that and move that ball along uh you

702
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,799
know i had

703
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,360
difference between like an edp and edr

704
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
they don't care hey how come my email is

705
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,200
slow where'd my email go

706
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,440
um you know culture is everyone it only

707
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,799
works if we're all involved kind of like

708
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
security i i think everybody in the

709
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
infosec field uh we're kind of going

710
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,559
through that now we're like hey we gotta

711
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,919
kind of be more open in what we're doing

712
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,960
or else no one's gonna play ball with us

713
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
so

714
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
a few considerations and i'm sorry the

715
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,679
formatting got messed up i i moved to

716
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,200
powerpoint this morning because google

717
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
slides on a full screen it doesn't

718
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,279
happen anyway um vendors are a problem

719
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,559
like i mentioned right you're in a

720
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,039
campaign tops 18 months

721
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,520
so i start running for president today

722
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,799

the team at gsa i go transfer my network

726
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
over uh so

727
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,039
i don't have a year contract to give you

728
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,760
um and things have gotten better michael

729
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
kaiser and ddc group you know if vendors

730
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,200
hey

731
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
we have services for you discounted

732
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,039
things like that are super great uh but

733
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,559
take advantage of them you know a lot of

734
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,600
folks just don't know that they're

735
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,880
available to them kind of like all the

736
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
stuff we do now

737
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
competition between campaigns

738
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,279
man it's just the dumbest dumbest thing

739
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,559
i don't get it

740
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,679
um

741
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,520
i had a thing where

742
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,200
hey i've got

743
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,120
campaigns don't share right

744
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,000
so

745
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,840
i had an email hey look we got a

746
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
phishing email should i call someone

747
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,600
from the warren campaign and let them

748
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,760
know should i call someone from biden

749
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,960
camp and just say hey should i call

750
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
someone from the trump camp

751
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,720
say hey guys we got this email like i

752
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,320
know they're 20 guys over there should i

753
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
give a call

754
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,760
no it's a competitive advantage uh you

755
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
heard mike yesterday mike sager's

756
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,919
awesome dude he works on the democratic

757
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,159
field he is a pretty progressive guy he

758
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,000
will never work for a republican

759
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,039
campaign

760
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,799
you know and that's kind of polarization

761
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,400
it's not against mike everyone i know is

762
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
like that um but would you share

763
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
information with them right politics is

764
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
super polarizing it's competitive

765
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
advantage but is it really like what are

766
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
you helping out um and i think that's

767
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,120
the thing that really needs to change

768
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,799
more

769
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,320
every dollar you spend as a dollar

770
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,400
doesn't go to votes i heard that so many

771
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
times and i get it and i get it but

772
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,559
security is the cost center and it's

773
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,840
always going to be you got to find that

774
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,799
balance one of the big problems is uh

775
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,320
folks that are running campaigns

776
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,200
like

777
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,120
security is not in your syllabus just

778
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,919
yet right security is a cost we can get

779
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,760
by without it and i'm sure a lot of you

780
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,440
do without every day now like why do i

781
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
need to put this in it's just a

782
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
roadblock it's a hurdle we don't have a

783
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
lot of time left so you know what are

784
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,520
you gonna do

785
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,559
um

786
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,840
and like i said

787
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,679
there's no compliance you don't have to

788
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,799
do something if you don't wanna do

789
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,600
something which is crazy uh you can set

790
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
up your environment and not have

791
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,880
multi-factor for your accounts and

792
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
that's cool no one's going to say

793
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
anything about it uh you can set up your

794
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
email not have spf checks or something

795
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
like that you might get some like some

796
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
horrible article online about oh this

797
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,240
guy doesn't have sps checked that's it

798
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
like no one's gonna there's no there's

799
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
no fine there's nothing like that at all

800
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,240
your ato is not gonna get revoked so

801
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,080
it's really up to you how good you wanna

802
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
make it and

803
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,760
therein lies the problem

804
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
you can make it really good you just

805
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
gotta get involved

806
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
and what's your bar

807
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,000
um you mentioned yesterday the the bell

808
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
first hundred playbook that came out of

809
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,279
harvard after 2016. if you haven't read

810
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,120
it go read it i think it's fantastic i

811
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
also think like

812
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
security doesn't have a bigger role in

813
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
it as it could as it should but i'm a

814
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
security guy and super biased right so

815
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,200
what do i know um

816
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
and again security is likely

817
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,880
one of the hats you're gonna wear and

818
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
most campaigns like i was a ciso is the

819
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,919
only one after i after i left out um

820
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
biden cam picked up chris derussa and

821
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,760
kind of went from there right

822
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,720
security guy is also usually the it guy

823
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
also usually the data guy you just know

824
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
computers so you do all the things on

825
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
the back end that's just your job in a

826
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,120
campaign because look we're operating

827
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
lean here we're you know we're here for

828
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,279
a couple months we're here for a for a

829
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,720
good time not a long time i guess the

830
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
phrase just

831
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
you're here to win and after that if you

832
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,440
know how to do something i'm gonna take

833
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,679
advantage of it oh you speak spanish

834
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,360
okay look what we're doing now oh you

835
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,559
speak russian oh look what we're doing

836
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
now uh just take advantage of your staff

837
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
members which i think is actually really

838
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
good it gives you a chance to let people

839
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
shine in an area they might not normally

840
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,440
because they just didn't know they were

841
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,399
able to

842
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,880
so but at the same time you kind of get

843
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
overworked you're super stressed you're

844
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:36,960
just

845
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,799
super super busy all the time um

846
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,200
i'm not quit

847
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
it's not a theme i know this thing feels

848
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,840
like it

849
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,240
uh like yeah i quit shortly before the

850
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,120
iowa caucus um

851
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
just a bunch of stuff or like you can

852
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
google it you know there was like like a

853
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,360
new york times thing and um

854
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,520
wall street journal article and uh i

855
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
quit right like

856
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,279
i can't really talk about it too much

857
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,120
but i i guess it's kind of a different

858
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
conversation for a different day a

859
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,000
different talk we've all kind of been in

860
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
this there there's some truisms we have

861
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,360
in our career

862
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
um things that kind of kind of stick

863
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
with you right

864
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,399
nobody takes care of you like you that's

865
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,760
just that'll stick with you the rest of

866
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,520
your life um

867
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
and whatever job you have whatever place

868
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
you work out now it's probably there

869
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
before you and it's going to be there

870
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
after you all right you are not

871
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,159
irreplaceable things are not going to

872
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,399
shut down just because you left and it's

873
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,080
like an ego smack to say that to a lot

874
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,279
of people like i walked away from the

875
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
white house as a fed that's your dream

876
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,240
job

877
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
so you know the white house is still

878
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
running shockingly but the white house

879
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,120
is still around you know um

880
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,240
it's just

881
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
things are temporal just remember that

882
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,440
in your career so anyway i quit

883
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,240
um along the way i met a lot of really

884
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
really cool people uh they didn't work

885
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,640
in security though now you heard some

886
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
some folks yesterday talk about

887
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,679
professional political operatives these

888
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,200
are folks that work on one campaign

889
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,320
campaign ends they go to another

890
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
campaign camp it's like contracting but

891
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,039
you don't really make money i i don't

892
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
um

893
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
it's a lot of moving you know it's like

894
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
uh

895
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,159
you're working a campaign you're working

896
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,080
the buddy judge campaign hey let's go to

897
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,919
south bend like you're gonna go get an

898
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,440
apartment in south bend and leave what

899
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
you're doing here i don't think there's

900
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,919
a lot of folks that can just kind of

901
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,279
pick up and do that and i know i

902
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,520
couldn't and i don't think i'd want to

903
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,559
so

904
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
you know i think more folks that are in

905
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
security and campaigns would be awesome

906
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,159
uh i think

907
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,159
more campaign folks that were aware of

908
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,360
security is where we would come in

909
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,720
so

910
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
all right let's talk about 2020 a little

911
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,159
bit

912
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,279
um

913
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,039
i don't i don't i don't really know what

914
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
happened

915
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,799
so

916
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,840
like

917
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,039
is everybody is a bit comfortable like

918
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,120
it's hard

919
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,840
to talk

920
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,520
about politics

921
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
without things getting political

922
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
and

923
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
working on a campaign it's super because

924
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,399
like hey man i don't i don't care about

925
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,279
politics i just work in security um and

926
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
you try and keep that like you really

927
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,399
try like i worked the white house you

928
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,600
know first year and a half the trump

929
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,640
administration

930
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,799
it's the chair you know not who sits in

931
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,080
the chair and after a while yeah it's

932
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,520
kind of suits in the chair um

933
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,799
so

934
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,520
you know the next part here it it

935
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
this is all my aperture and yours might

936
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
be different and i'm not saying this is

937
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,480
the way everything went down it's just

938
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,799
hard to really kind of recap everything

939
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,080
um

940
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
without you know causing a lot of strife

941
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
and dissent you know i just i'm not

942
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,840
trying one side's wronger than the

943
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,919
others just you know

944
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,039
so 2020 all right um

945
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,120
when you look at what happened

946
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
it kind of

947
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,720
there was no hack right there was no dnc

948
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,919
d-trip things like that um

949
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,200
you know it's normal election for the

950
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,880
most part as far as like the election

951
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,399
process itself

952
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,679
um

953
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,640
you know

954
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,279
polarization is alive and well i think

955
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,679
we learned that a lot in in 2020. you

956
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,960
know for some people in america is

957
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
exactly the outcome we expected um

958
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
there's a whole lot of like uh well well

959
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,159
well it isn't if it isn't the

960
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,279
consequences of my actions so

961
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,720
you know it was just it's just a really

962
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,840
really weird

963
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,519
election cycle this time but there

964
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,399
wasn't like a um nothing got hacked like

965
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,519
there was no

966
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,880
no nothing like a technical hack like in

967
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,559
2016. it was a different different area

968
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,840
this time

969
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,559
2016 this is me inauguration day

970
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,880
wild uh not as wild as this time but

971
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,080
like it was

972
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,399
on par i guess um

973
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,679
you know

974
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,000
i remember i was the capital uh and a

975
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,519
fight broke out that's where i was

976
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,480
looking like a fight broke out

977
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,000
at the capitol on inauguration day

978
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,159
like it's like a kegger and it's just

979
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,159
wild i just never seen like i've been to

980
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,360
the government for a long time and i've

981
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
never seen something like that so

982
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,200
2020 i was like oh yeah you know that

983
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,559
kind of tracks like you know this time

984
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,919
they brought grain instead of a keg i

985
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,760
got it um

986
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
so it was just it was different you know

987
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
it was still screwed up super screwed up

988
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
but in a different way which i guess is

989
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,600
good

990
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,480
um 2016 let's look at what we had right

991
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
the d trip hack the dnc

992
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,880
uh hfa

993
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,399
guccifer anthony remember that guy

994
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,279
remember like like two days or a week

995
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,399
before the election

996
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
when uh fbi director comey came out i

997
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,519
was like hey this guy has some emails on

998
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,320
his laptop that weren't his

999
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,440
but it's cool

1000
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,679
like that was a big deal and of course

1001
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,440
the whole email thing that like i just

1002
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,519
whatever um

1003
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,080
2020 it's a lot of technical poking you

1004
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
saw like that weak sauce that iran did

1005
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,000
you know like irgc is not really known

1006
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
for impact operations it's more of an

1007
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
mls thing it's a whole different talk

1008
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
but like that's what we saw we didn't

1009
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,799
see a campaign get hacked or at least

1010
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,159
publicly know about it and i think

1011
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,519
that's a really good credit to the folks

1012
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,200
at google folks at microsoft because

1013
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,559
that infrastructure is hosted there um

1014
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,880
missed information disinformation you

1015
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
know you gotta you gotta admit it was a

1016
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,519
pretty big deal right there's a lot of

1017
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,880
that going around this time like a whole

1018
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,080
big bunch

1019
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,679
um

1020
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,799
and kovid

1021
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,120
like you you kovid changed the way

1022
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
campaigns are

1023
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,240
campaigns are big like door-to-door

1024
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,000
knocking right like hey man come vote

1025
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
for pete

1026
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
if you knock on my door like the third

1027
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,039
week of march i'm not gonna answer that

1028
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,360
door

1029
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,120
so how does that work for a campaign

1030
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
we're like we need to go out and talk to

1031
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,519
people we need to go to these primary

1032
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,960
states and go out and talk to people hey

1033
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
get awareness with my guy

1034
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,320
how's that work now a lot of phone banks

1035
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,760
a lot of phone banks and i think that

1036
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,200
changed forever

1037
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
and covid

1038
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,320
you know everything leading up to the

1039
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,480
election everything after is just was

1040
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,039
wild uh the response the vaccine you

1041
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,480
know that

1042
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,840
did have an impact on our election this

1043
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,600
year i mean you know two years ago it's

1044
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,879
what happened so 2024 what's that mean i

1045
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,760
don't know

1046
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
like i really don't i it could be

1047
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,918
awesome it could be just like a fiddle

1048
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
plane in the background well i'm just

1049
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,599
um

1050
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,560
and i know there's a bunch of stuff i'm

1051
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,119
leaving out right like i understand i

1052
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,879
understand i spent most of my career

1053
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,320
especially the 2016 election at the

1054
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
white house it's like i read a lot of

1055
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
classified stuff and i don't want to get

1056
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,960
arrested for saying something there's

1057
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,679
clouds

1058
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,839
oh that was oh huh turns out

1059
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,960
um so yeah

1060
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
november 5th 2024

1061
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,199
um

1062
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,359
like i said you know you're gonna see a

1063
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,000
lot of folks campaign spinning up now

1064
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
got about 18 months got a year and a

1065
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,199
half um

1066
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,440
security's 24 7 thing normally a

1067
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
campaign is like

1068
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,560
three or four cats in a room like hey

1069
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,880
man you should run for president

1070
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,640
and that's literally how it goes spins

1071
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,839
out from there start getting your

1072
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,160
fundraiser to start security guy might

1073
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
come in you know eight nine months down

1074
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
the road if at all

1075
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
uh

1076
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,560
so i guess what i'm saying is maybe you

1077
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,320
should run for for candidacy and

1078
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
security is first right that's the way

1079
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,240
to do it

1080
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,200
[Applause]

1081
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
so

1082
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
because i'm a nerd because we're all

1083
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,119
nerds we're going to break this down the

1084
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,640
ways we're not you know people process

1085
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
technology right that's what you break

1086
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
things down into and there's always a

1087
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,119
wild card on the end um

1088
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,640
you know and and i think it comes down

1089
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
to these areas here

1090
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,880
uh when you talk about people you know

1091
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,200
you talk about the mis disinformation

1092
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
sisa kind of has something for that

1093
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
where it's their their rumor central you

1094
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,079
know election myth versus reality uh i

1095
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,760
get all my news from twitter and do my

1096
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,680
own research so i'm good

1097
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,040
i'm kidding don't do that don't be a

1098
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
dum-dum uh this is like point people to

1099
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,000
this this is the problem is you know hey

1100
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,359
this is the place where you should get

1101
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
your actual information from um there

1102
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,760
it's gotten a lot better but the

1103
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,040
weaponization of information is

1104
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,359
definitely not new you know the ability

1105
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,320
to rationally discourse is is gone and i

1106
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,000
think part of the problem is

1107
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
you know no one's gonna have a

1108
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
conversation like oh you know you know i

1109
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
really appreciate it i've reviewed the

1110
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,880
notes you sent me i read cross reference

1111
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,160
and notes and i see your point of view

1112
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
now and i'm a better person for it and

1113
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,760
like nobody says that

1114
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
those aren't the conversations i wish

1115
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,680
they were they're just not so

1116
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,119
point people to place where information

1117
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,640
from if they don't want to go they don't

1118
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
want to go i can drag you to the water i

1119
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
can't make you drink it

1120
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,839
um

1121
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,359
voter fraud

1122
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,480
so

1123
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,160
i kind of didn't want to put this in but

1124
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
it's kind of a more and more big thing

1125
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,720
um i do a lot of like i work with a lot

1126
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
of voter lawyers and i'm trying to

1127
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,359
understand it but like the only thing

1128
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,599
that i can come up with for a rational

1129
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,839
explanation is like i lost

1130
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,480
um

1131
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,320
you guys have heard of math right your

1132
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,720
numbers you guys know numbers

1133
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,839
like

1134
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,000
if i want to swing an election

1135
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,079
i'm not going to change three voter

1136
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,560
rolls in wisconsin it's just not how

1137
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
that works it's

1138
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,880
so i'm gonna i'm gonna mess with that

1139
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
but the back end where the votes are

1140
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,560
counted i'm gonna say that's an integral

1141
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,599
system and there's nothing wrong with

1142
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,440
that at all like that's not how you rig

1143
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
an election how you swing an election i

1144
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
was lucky enough to hang out in

1145
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
countries in the military where they do

1146
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,000
swing elections and they didn't change

1147
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,640
voter rolls i'm just saying like

1148
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
i have no doubt that voter fraud exists

1149
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
okay

1150
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,240
i also have no doubt that voter fraud

1151
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,000
does not exist the scale it would need

1152
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,160
to to actually swing an election okay

1153
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,320
it's not how math works so

1154
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
and again you can't tell folks that

1155
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
because

1156
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,880
that rational discourse isn't gone

1157
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
hopefully it gets better but yeah if you

1158
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,240
explain math to people in numbers it'd

1159
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,959
be super good

1160
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,560
so

1161
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,680
this was an fbi note that came out

1162
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
um cyber actors part of an ongoing

1163
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
campaign

1164
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,599
tax technology hacked the things

1165
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,280
a couple of you know secretaries of

1166
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,320
state election officials getting

1167
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,359
targeted

1168
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,599
it's happened i want to say yeah october

1169
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,119
of last year

1170
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,320
um

1171
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
sucks right

1172
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,599
it's midterms

1173
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,280
like but nobody cares about midterms so

1174
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
i don't get why so

1175
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,119
and it's

1176
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,200
midterm elections getting targeted

1177
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,280
you know i don't care enough about it

1178
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,200
and it's weird because when you go back

1179
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,040
to 2018

1180
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,880
same thing happened then

1181
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,240
uh midterm

1182
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
centers targeted campaigns targeted

1183
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,839
elections securities targeted again

1184
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,760
midterms nobody cares so start calling

1185
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,720
bruno

1186
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,959
uh

1187
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,560
so

1188
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,800
road to a broken campaign right you're a

1189
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,960
security guy your job is keep that

1190
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,480
campaign secured i think these are kind

1191
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,680
of the big things that you're really

1192
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,640
worried about uh technical compromise

1193
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,200
that is your nightmare one of your

1194
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,119
systems getting locked up

1195
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,599
on a campaign fun fact remember that

1196
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,680
part i mentioned the egregious lack of

1197
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,400
oversight or compliance so i would say

1198
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,240
90 to 99.9 percent of your staff is

1199
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
using their own laptop

1200
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
like it's using their own gear

1201
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,119
um

1202
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,960
then it becomes a big problem you want

1203
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,440
to install what on my machine

1204
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,680
uh no and to be honest i'm like no i'm

1205
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,880
with you on that one i get that that

1206
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,119
makes sense to me so

1207
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,640
you know again goes back to buying but a

1208
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,760
technical compromise that's what your

1209
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,240
fear is um proxy interference we all

1210
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,440
know what that is and how bad that can

1211
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,920
be as a cso you can't really do much

1212
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,160
about it but you better be aware of it

1213
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,240
um you're a security professional your

1214
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
staff is not so a lot of the things that

1215
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
get into your head are gonna just kind

1216
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,920
of float around and echo back out

1217
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,960
um

1218
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,880
the oversight it's a huge problem and

1219
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
credibility like right let's see once

1220
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,160
you screw something up and this is

1221
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,760
internal or external you're gonna buy

1222
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,440
that trust back right we've all messed

1223
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,880
something up at work and like all right

1224
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
nick next time we're just gonna let

1225
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,599
somebody else talk and you can just sit

1226
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,800
back branches

1227
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,280
but that credibility is super important

1228
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,960
because security is so new in the

1229
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
political sphere

1230
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,320
you know let's make it count let's make

1231
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
it do the right thing

1232
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
but i think the biggest one is apathy

1233
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,319
and and i think

1234
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,839
that's a huge problem because all the

1235
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,520
things i mentioned

1236
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,960
none of them change

1237
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,319
if if we don't care if we don't do

1238
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,760
anything if we just sit around

1239
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,200
about it and like don't do something

1240
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,640
about it and i get it's messed up it's

1241
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,400
super messed up like what are you gonna

1242
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,839
do like we just sit around complaining

1243
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,800
about it i'm with you but we'll get

1244
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
drunk but like it has to get better and

1245
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,720
we have to make it better

1246
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,880
so let's wrap this up

1247
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
uh

1248
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
oh look at me go

1249
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
okay

1250
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,160
so which way is momentum swing i did

1251
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,079
like a whole bunch of like probability

1252
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,920
formulas you know i had like a bayesian

1253
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
calculation in there and whether things

1254
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,680
were anyway

1255
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,800
um

1256
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,920
there's a couple things i think are

1257
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,890
different now you know um

1258
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,359
[Music]

1259
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,520
uh jen easterly over at cesa is doing

1260
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
awesome work they just picked up bob

1261
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,480
lord you guys know bob lord if you talk

1262
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,680
to him for more than like three minutes

1263
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,480
a hardware token appears uh doing super

1264
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,000
awesome work

1265
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,599
bob lords of the dnc in 2016 uh 2020

1266
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,440
rather and and the work he was doing

1267
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,119
there was so amazing like the dnc in

1268
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,319
2016 we all know what happened uh bob

1269
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,280
and the team there are really

1270
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,040
responsible for kind of restoring that

1271
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,200
credibility and you look at what they've

1272
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,720
done and where they were it's super

1273
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
awesome

1274
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,280
uh

1275
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,119
yeah free fido keys you know you

1276
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,040
mentioned um michael kaiser here

1277
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,359
yesterday ddc that group if you're ever

1278
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,040
thinking of going in a campaign remember

1279
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,680
his number remember his name um

1280
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,040
those services that are available

1281
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
through that catalog are incredibly

1282
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,839
useful the other one i found useful was

1283
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,280
dhs has a services catalog they offer

1284
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,720
you know hey we'll do some vulnerability

1285
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,920
scanning we'll do some fishing tests

1286
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,440
like we didn't see eye to eye on that

1287
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,599
but like it's fine um but they'll do it

1288
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,880
for free and if you're in a campaign

1289
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,079
you've got no money like that's what i

1290
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,280
need free stuff i need all the free

1291
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,839
stuff you're gonna give me

1292
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,200
uh but i think it all comes down to this

1293
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,880
dumb phrase right you ever heard this

1294
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,920
before all politics is local um and i

1295
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,200
know what it meant like everybody the

1296
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,640
campaign said it and i was like oh thank

1297
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,920
you for that that's super helpful um

1298
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,200
but we've all heard the phrase the

1299
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,119
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the

1300
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,280
cell it's completely useless

1301
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,599
but it's true

1302
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,160
and that's what this is it's completely

1303
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,560
useless fact but it's true

1304
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,160
um

1305
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,240
if we don't start locally nothing

1306
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,000
changes widely

1307
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,520
so

1308
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,960
you know go vote

1309
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,359

1322
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,400
tell you like where you need to go what

1323
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
you need to do who you represent it's

1324
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,000
really simple stuff it's like just go do

1325
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,839
it it's just tell people to go here um

1326
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,359
some of the other considerations

1327
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,000
donate money i know i just kind of

1328
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,359
on the part where like you're gonna get

1329
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,680
spam emails all the time but like

1330
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,160
time is money and if you don't have time

1331
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
donate money to a campaign

1332
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,040
um volunteer you know we all live

1333
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,480
somewhere there's a candidate running

1334
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,760
and i don't mean on a presidential

1335
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,119
campaign there's probably a congressman

1336
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,960
or a senator or even local they don't

1337
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,640
have the staff they don't have the money

1338
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,280
like i i was on a presidential campaign

1339
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,760
for a state house election how much

1340
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,599
budget do you think he has for security

1341
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,760
or she has for security this is not

1342
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,200
gonna happen

1343
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,880
so voluntary to organization there are

1344
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
plenty of groups out there um

1345
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,200
i want to say is defending

1346
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,400
[Music]

1347
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,240
the other ddc there's michael kaiser's

1348
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
ddc and there's another one and i get

1349
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,400
him confused but basically we talk about

1350
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,839
donations like you can donate to a

1351
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,119
campaign right

1352
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,040
you can only donate want to say 2600

1353
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,119
or so 26 28 right around there that's

1354
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,359
all you get so there's some groups out

1355
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,880
that like hey i'm gonna come down to my

1356
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,640
little checklist sit down with staff

1357
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
lock down their devices things like that

1358
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,319
i can do i can give you twenty six

1359
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,720
hundred dollars worth of that service

1360
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,200
anybody here done consulting

1361
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,119
is that like what 10 minutes cup coffee

1362
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,480
maybe just

1363
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,240
like what are you gonna get out of that

1364
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,880
so that's the problem um

1365
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,079
pay attention

1366
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,240
midterms coming up you guys know that

1367
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,000
pretty big one yeah all right pay

1368
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,200
attention to it um go work on a campaign

1369
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,520
you know i i've had good experience bad

1370
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,280
experience but it's the wildest raw you

1371
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,040
will ever go on uh it is like a career

1372
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,800
capped into a couple months you know

1373
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
like either you win

1374
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,480
or you don't and that's just how it goes

1375
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
it's a pretty binary job unless along

1376
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,240
the way yeah and then you get fired but

1377
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
you know and the other part don't be

1378
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,640
apathetic i i really i can't stress i

1379
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,720
know it's easier said than done i know i

1380
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,359
know um

1381
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,000
again kids in the bag iwillvote.com go

1382
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,520
there go vote it's just it's super

1383
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,040
important um so

1384
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,920
you know i i did a thing one time

1385
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,599
in pretty big stage right i was the

1386
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,160
first season u.s presidential campaign

1387
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,400
to bachchio so maybe like a 300 jeopardy

1388
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,839
question like sometimes

1389
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,280
um

1390
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,640
but there's other campaigns that need

1391
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,480
help every campaign out there does they

1392
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,599
need more than to see so they need

1393
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,040
security staff it needs security

1394
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,240
awareness you need to be more aware of

1395
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,599
what security is in the world we live in

1396
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,560
today

1397
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,640
um the only way to get better to get

1398
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,400
better my they're just supposed to be

1399
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
birds uh you know and it closed out like

1400
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,440

work in security guys come on we pushed

1402

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,200
career

1404
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,640
we're going to do it in politics now

1405
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,880
we're doing a campaigns now so that's

1406
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,720
how that works uh like that's it

1407
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,599
so

1408
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,960
thanks to a whole big bunch of people um

1409
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,359
thank all of you for coming and i guess

1410
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,759
that's really all i have any questions

1411
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,079
yes

1412
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,760
how does physical

1413
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,280
physical for who like the principle

1414
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,560
no i'm kidding um

1415
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,200
so so the question was like uh physical

1416
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,680
like purse force per like persec and

1417
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,920
cyber security so

1418
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
you kind of wear both of those hats

1419
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,599
right and maybe you shouldn't like with

1420
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,520
my background i i've kind of done that

1421
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,359
before so yeah i kind of know how to do

1422
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,280
that um

1423
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,760
limited staff so for a candidate you

1424
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,280
know your your principal is always going

1425
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,880
to have that that body man that's going

1426
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,040
to have that you know service with them

1427
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,680
uh staff you know put some cameras up if

1428
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,960
they're there you're normally in a

1429
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,200
rented building for a few months so how

1430
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,440
much can you really do uh you have badge

1431
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,119
access set up you know just your generic

1432
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,359
stuff your basic stuff low level but

1433
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,680
you're gonna put in what you have time

1434
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,480
for

1435
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
what you have budget for

1436
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,319
and kind of what you're allowed to do

1437
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,800
right because hey we're doing numbered

1438
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
pins on every door in the building yeah

1439
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
man that's not gonna happen we don't

1440
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,119
have time for that we gotta we got

1441
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:07,920
uh

1442
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,880
so

1443
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
you know kind of pick and choose but you

1444
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
as a security guy

1445
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,119
probably going to be under your

1446
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,760
wheelhouse too

1447
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,560
yes

1448
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,400
typically they don't you know

1449
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,960
no uh kidding i'm kidding not really but

1450
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,040
i'm kidding um

1451
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,160
i got a call randomly from

1452
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,000
a friend who was like hey we got your

1453
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
name from from someone which is like

1454
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,040
never a good phone call and

1455
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
you know i i want to say i know ragtag

1456
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,760
is one of the groups out there um but

1457
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,280
there are plenty of folks out there when

1458
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
you know the dnc

1459
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,480
they don't recruit actively that's the

1460
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,920
thing they're not looking for a cyber

1461
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,520
person they're looking for a person to

1462
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
go knock on doors

1463
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,880
so

1464
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,119
go knock on doors and say i also know

1465
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,640
computers and then you'll kind of wear

1466
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,000
that hat as well you'll make the same

1467
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,680
money right but then you'll which i'll

1468
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,880
just do the more work that's how that

1469
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,880
