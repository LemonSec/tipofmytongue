5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
chaos and needless busy work

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
aka vendor risk management so how many

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,480
sure sure russell's gonna interrupt

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
all right

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
cool all right now we've got all the

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
formalities out of the way

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,480
all right so what we're going to talk

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,600
about today we're going to talk about

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
who who am i

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
what is vendor risk management kind of

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
give you a brief overview of what that

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,959
is why did i decide to do this talk

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,479
other than the fact that russell begged

18
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,840
me to do it and said it was going to be

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
the best one here and i don't believe

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,880
that for a minute he was just trying to

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,560
sweet talk me

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
what are the framework requirements why

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,759
do we even do vendor risk management in

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,439
the first place we're going to talk

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,600
about some real world stories from my

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
current position in a former position

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,280
we're going to talk about what really

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
matters for vendor risk management and

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
we're going to talk about what how to

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
fix that problem and get some input from

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,079
folks here in the room because i don't

32
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,520
know all the answers all i can do is

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
relay what i see and what i see the

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
problems being so a little bit about me

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
i started an internet business in

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
pensacola florida back in 1996 it was

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
one of the first web hosting companies

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
in the united states a company called

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
creative data concepts it became grid

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,880
south networks i merged with app river

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,040
i've worked for app river and zix for

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
about 15 years i've been involved in

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
infosec probably

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,119
longer than some of you have been alive

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
but infosec wasn't a thing back then so

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
we just called it hey we were just doing

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,960
sus admin stuff right so

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
but i've spoken at quite a number of

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,759
different conferences all different

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,080
areas my expertise was in dns when i was

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
working for app river system engineer on

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
their

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
security team and then also on their

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
spam filtering so a little bit about my

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
background

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
but what is vendor risk management what

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
why is it important how many of you are

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
involved in compliance or security and

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
you have to do vendor risk management

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
that you're a vendor and you have to

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
provide that for

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
your customers or they ask it from you

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
everybody right pretty much everybody

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,280
does that

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
why do you do it

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
that's that's exactly it right nobody

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,959
knows why do we do this right what what

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,879
is vendor risk management right it's

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
it's the ongoing process of identifying

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
managing and monitoring risks associated

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,599
with a vendor or supplier the problem is

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,280
a lot of us are security minded and

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
those risks are more than just security

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
related risks those risks deal with

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
security obviously but they also deal

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,599
with health and safety compliance risk

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
reputational risks financial risk

78
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
operational risk things that deal with

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
strategic movement for your business

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
most organizations refer to this special

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
publication 837

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
when they're looking at how to do risk

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,400
management

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
or they look at the iso 31000 framework

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,959
for their risk management guidelines

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
then this documents are available for

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
free

88
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
if you want to get the iso documents you

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,599
have to subscribe to those and pay for

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,760
them so they do have a cost involved

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
with them but all these different risks

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
go into determining

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,440
how a vendor is going to impact your

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
business or how you as a vendor are

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,640
going to impact your customers business

96
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
right so that's why we do this you know

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
everybody has a service level agreement

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,400
or a master service agreement that they

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
provide for their customers you have an

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
expectation of service from your vendors

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
and we do this risk management process

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
to help understand where the shortfalls

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
and where the things that we have to

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,159
look at to make sure that our business

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,080
can meet our expectations and that the

106
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
customer's expectations are being met if

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,040
it's the other way around

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
so what what is

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,760
what what isn't vendor risk management

110
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
well it's not a hey you got to fill out

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,399
this questionnaire thing it's not a

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,560
completed security form it's not a

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
security score from a particular vendor

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,120
when i'm talking about those vendors

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,560
we're going to get into

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
we're not going to mention one that's in

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,440
the room but his is a little bit

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
different his is a little bit more

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
useful than what most of them are but

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,479
there's a number of them out there bit

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,199
site security scorecard iss all of those

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
vendors will give you a security rating

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,720
based on what they see on the public

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
internet based on your business we'll

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
talk about that in a little bit going

126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
forward

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
vendor risk management is not one size

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
fits all you cannot say here's my

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
process and every vendor has to do this

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
process come hell or high water if you

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,919
don't do it i'm going to stop my feet

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
yell and scream and make you do it

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,240
that's not good to risk management right

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
the process has to be different it's not

135
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
checking a box why do a lot of people do

136
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,280
it you said because they ask us to

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,800
okay just because they ask just because

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
they say jump off the bridge are you

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
gonna do it

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
right i mean that's what it comes down

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
to right you have to figure out what

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
makes sense for your business to provide

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,039
for your customers and what makes sense

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
for your customer or your vendors to

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
provide to you and it's not a once a

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,039
year exercise because risk varies over

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
time right think of what what just

148
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
happened overseas recently

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
right all of the stuff going on in

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
ukraine do you think people are waiting

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
a year to reassess the risk with their

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
suppliers in the ukraine or people that

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
are related to that they better not be

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
or their business is going to be in bad

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
shape right so following a compliance

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,840
framework that says you have to do a

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,479
vendor risk assessment every year is

158
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,720
foolishness if you're living in a world

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
that changes in real time

160
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
many organizations do a lot of things

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
like outsource their vendor risk

162
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,120
management to a third party and these

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
third parties in many cases simply grab

164
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
a bunch of questionnaires throw it at

165
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
you as the vendor get you to fill it out

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
then they broker that data back to their

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
client their client pays them a shitload

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
of money to do that and you did all the

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,319
work for them right so that's one of the

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
problems that i that i faced and what i

171
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,720
want to look at here is how do we rank

172
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
risk and this is something that a lot of

173
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,919
people don't uh don't do effectively

174
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,919
they don't look at how risk is ranked

175
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
and way we look at risk from a an

176
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
organizational management perspective is

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,960
risks are based on two things they're

178
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,199
based on their current state

179
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,319
and then they're based on some sort of

180
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,479
future state so a spread

181
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,319
and the the likelihood what we do is we

182
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,080
consider the likelihood that a risk will

183
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
be realized and then we look at the

184
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
impact of that realization of a risk and

185
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
then we would take a chart like this and

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
and give different ratings how much

187
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,479
likelihood or how much impact there

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
could be the organization and every risk

189
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
would get a score based on that and fall

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
somewhere in these quadrants on this

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
risk matrix now the the delta looking at

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
a risk the way it is today versus the

193
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
way it is when it's mitigated

194
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
would dictate how much money you want to

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
spend or how much how many controls you

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
want to put in place to reduce that risk

197
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
to an acceptable level and i think one

198
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
of the things that i like to emphasize

199
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
when i talk is that

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
people have this false sense that

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,440
security is an absolute thing

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
it is not

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
all right but i ask people how much

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
security is enough does anybody know the

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,120
answer to that question

206
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,840
just enough

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
the answer is just enough and why is

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
that well that's because you don't want

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,479
to spend more to secure your

210
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,120
organization than it takes to reduce the

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
risk to a level that's acceptable to

212
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,800
your organization why would you do that

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
you don't do it at home you don't have

214
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
doors that have a man trap and 16 levels

215
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
of facial recognition to get into the

216
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,639
house you could protect your house to

217
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
that level

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
you're laughing like that's funny but

219
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
that's what we do in infosec we protect

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,680
things to the nth level without really

221
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
assessing what the risk is to protect

222
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,840
right we don't look at the risk and

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
protect to the risk to get the

224
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
the um

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
to get the risk down to a level that's

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
acceptable business we try to eliminate

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
the risk you cannot eliminate risk

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,280
so

229
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
when people in security say security is

230
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,759
a thing it's not security is relative to

231
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,280
the risk that a business is willing to

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
live with and every business is willing

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
to live with a different level of risk

234
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,440
so

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
that's this is how we we rank risk we

236
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
look at the cost of reducing your risk

237
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
from its current state to its potential

238
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
better state that's a control that we

239
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
would put in place either some sort of

240
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
administrative or technical control and

241
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,360
that those come at a cost we evaluate

242
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
the cost of the risk to the business so

243
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
we know that each of these different

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
levels if the risk is realized let's say

245
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,880
it's an impact of severe well maybe a

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
severe risk has an impact of

247
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,959
five million dollars a year in revenue

248
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,320
to your business

249
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
okay so to reduce that severe risk down

250
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,680
to maybe a moderate risk which might say

251
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,480
oh

252
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
it's a loss of a hundred thousand

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
dollars if that risk is realized right

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
so you've got a big spread there

255
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
that difference in quantitative value

256
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
dictates how much you should spend to

257
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
reduce that risk to that level and if

258
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,399
you're going to spend more than that

259
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
then it's not worth reducing the risk to

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
that level to the business

261
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,720
does that make sense

262
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
okay

263
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
so why did i do this talk

264
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
well a few years ago i was working

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
happily as a security engineer for app

266
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
river in 2019 app river got acquired by

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
zix corporation and they came in and

268
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
said you have to do all the security and

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
compliance you have to do a sock 2

270
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
report you have to do sarbanes-oxley

271
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,120
audits you have to do a pci audit

272
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
and you've got nobody to do it so jim

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,279
you're elected

274
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,600
to help get us on that track

275
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
so i moved from my engineering

276
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,800
department over to the it department

277
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
worked under the

278
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,399
cio and worked directly with the ciso

279
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
and my goal was to bring app river into

280
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
the same compliance that zix had well

281
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,640
one of the things that zix was getting

282
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
from a lot of their customers was a lot

283
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
of security questionnaires a lot of

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
interaction with customers making sure

285
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,320
that we were meeting their vendor risk

286
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
management needs and what ended up

287
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
happening was i was dealing with third

288
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,320
parties that were asking me to fill out

289
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
a 500 question survey when you see the

290
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,120
you know the quote up there from kendra

291
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
nothing says welcome back to work like a

292
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
500 question

293
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,880
questionnaire from a customer how many

294
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
have gotten ones like that

295
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
none yeah you've gotten them right how

296
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
many of you have like a sock two report

297
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,839
or an iso report right do you think the

298
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,839
vendor looked at that and even cared no

299
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,279
they just said here's the questionnaire

300
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,600
fill it out you do the work for us right

301
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
so that was the kind of stuff that got

302
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
me going and looking at this whole

303
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
process because it doesn't scale when

304
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,079
you've got

305
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
20 or 30 customers maybe you can do it

306
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
you know app river had

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,880
40 000 customers and they're all

308
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
starting to ask us for

309
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
one-off surveys of different types from

310
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
different vendors some that they made up

311
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
themselves some that were bought from

312
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,399
third parties but none of them were the

313
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,800
same and it created a process that just

314
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
didn't work so what we ended up seeing

315
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,279
was we were not meeting customer demands

316
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,600
quickly enough sales people were

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
up our butt to get the things done

318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,720
because they want the sale the

319
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,079
customer's not going to do the sale

320
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,279
until the

321
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
security questionnaires are answered so

322
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
we had them barking at us

323
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
customers are then starting to use

324
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
security scores instead of looking at

325
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
overall vendor risk management and they

326
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
weren't giving us

327
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
time to get these things done we're just

328
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
wasting a lot of time and not getting a

329
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
lot of success with the customer so we

330
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
changed things up a bit and i'm going to

331
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
talk to you about how how we did that

332
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
but first i want to show you why

333
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
a lot of people do these things i asked

334
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
the question why in the beginning well

335
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,800
this is some of the requirements why do

336
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
people do these vendor risk management

337
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,399
assessments anyway they're typically

338
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
required for sock too they're required

339
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,279
for

340
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,000
pci they're required for iso and also

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,560
for a cmmc compliance which follows a

342
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,399
government standard there you have to

343
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,240
have some sort of vendor risk management

344
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
in place to be able to

345
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
validate that you're actually vetting

346
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
your vendors and keeping them at a

347
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
certain standard

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
and what what the the problem is these

349
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,560
need to be scoped by the business that's

350
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
doing the assessment so it depends on

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
the type of business that you're running

352
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
it depends on the type of business that

353
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
your vendor runs what they're supplying

354
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
to you what kind of access they have to

355
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
data what kind of access they have to

356
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
your infrastructure there's a lot of

357
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,079
questions that go into this

358
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
i set this up here so i can reach it

359
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
easier

360
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,200
and if you look at for example the sock

361
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
2 requirements

362
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
this is just a couple of them that have

363
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,680
a requirement to do vendor risk

364
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
assessments and when you're looking at

365
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
the sock 2 criteria if you see the cc

366
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
that's called the common criteria so

367
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,560
that's required for all sock 2 reports

368
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
in a sock 2 framework you can there's 5

369
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
trust principles that you can do an

370
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
audit on security is required and you

371
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,639
can pick any one of the other four uh in

372
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,200
this case the privacy trust principle

373
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,360
also has a requirement for uh some

374
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
additional commitments from your vendors

375
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,760
so these are required for 2 in order to

376
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
pass a sock to audit

377
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,760
iso 27001 has similar but more

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
restrictive requirements they're more

379
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
general because

380
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
iso certification is built for

381
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
any kind of business it's not built for

382
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,600
just a tech business it's built for any

383
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
type of business manufacturing service

384
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
whatever

385
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
so you have to do a lot of

386
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
interpretation and if you look through

387
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,200
the um

388
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
clauses that are in the iso 27002

389
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,880
series this is just one of about seven

390
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
of them that are in there and it tells

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
you the different things that are

392
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
required as part of a

393
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,000
an ongoing

394
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,160
vendor risk management program and a lot

395
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
of them you wouldn't even think of doing

396
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
right some of them deal with um illegal

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,839
regulations making sure that your

398
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
vendors are following what their legal

399
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,880
requirements are

400
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
what other third parties do your vendors

401
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,320
use do they use outside contractors

402
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
right and you're a lot of you might be

403
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
in the government space and sometimes

404
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
you're not allowed to do business with a

405
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
vendor that uses

406
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,079
uh contractors that are outside that are

407
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,519
not u.s citizens right there's some

408
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
requirements for those kinds of things

409
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
so you have to be careful about that

410
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,560
when you're doing your your reviews

411
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
so let's talk about a few

412
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,560
real world stories here i want to relate

413
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
some of the experiences that we had when

414
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
i was working at six and when i ended up

415
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
inheriting the cso's responsibilities at

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
that company part of my duties like i

417
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
said earlier involved dealing with

418
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
customer requests and for security data

419
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
about the company and the services that

420
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,399
we were providing and i quickly learned

421
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,120
that the current processes did not scale

422
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
our customers were sending us

423
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
proprietary questionnaires hiring

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
third-party organizations like archer

425
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,040
and other things to

426
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
sending us a form log in do this thing

427
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
and i was some weeks i would get 5 10 15

428
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
of these things now keep in mind we

429
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
already had a sock 2 type 2 report a

430
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,240
sock 3 certificate which is a sock 3

431
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
certificate just says you have a sock 2

432
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,959
report and we're not giving you the

433
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,160
whole report they're kind of useless uh

434
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
they have a we also had an iso

435
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,079
certification and a pci aoc for a

436
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
service provider organization from an

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
outside auditor so it's key it's an

438
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,440
outside auditor somebody has already

439
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,959
attested to the fact that we did all of

440
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,959
these things we would lead with these

441
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,279
documents and we still receive requests

442
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,720
and typically these requests will take

443
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
one to two days minimum to complete per

444
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,959
customer and that just did not scale we

445
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,880
didn't have the staff to do that so the

446
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
first thing we implemented was a

447
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
development of a diligence kit where we

448
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
took all of these documents created a

449
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
few other more detailed security

450
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,399
documents put them into this diligence

451
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,519
kit and we also provided um

452
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,720
if you look up there it's got a list of

453
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
what was in there but we put in what was

454
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
called a gap letter or security

455
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
statement every quarter of the cso or

456
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
myself would write

457
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
all of the changes that happened across

458
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,759
the organization that was in scope for

459
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,560
the audit and put that into this letter

460
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,120
they got our pen test report

461
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,560
summaries all the things that they

462
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
needed to make a reasonable assumption

463
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,079
that we were doing the things we needed

464
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,000
to do to protect their data we would

465
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
give this to customers as well as had on

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
our website a whole raft of different

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
things about what we did from a security

468
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
perspective for each of the different

469
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
services so that they could look at that

470
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
and based on that knowledge then they

471
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
would have a reasonable assurance that

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
they could do business with us but the

473
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
key thing that we did is we adjusted our

474
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,880
master services agreement so that on our

475
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,320
website if you looked at our master

476
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,480
service agreement we told them flat out

477
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
we do not answer security questionnaires

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
people would demand that from us we

479
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,639
would point them back to the msa and say

480
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,240
we don't answer them

481
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
they would pound their feet and stomp

482
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
their feet and pound their fists and say

483
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,160
you got to answer this and i said why

484
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,600
we've given you everything that we have

485
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
and in many cases these questionnaires

486
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
would simply be a rehash of the entire

487
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,279
sock 2 framework

488
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,440
asking us exactly the same questions

489
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
that are covered in that whole sock 2

490
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
report in a much greater detail and they

491
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
were just too lazy to open the document

492
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
and fill it out themselves so we got the

493
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
point where we just wouldn't do it for

494
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,199
them what we ended up doing was telling

495
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,560
them here's you have our security

496
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
documentation and what we want you to do

497
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,199
is we want you to fill out what you need

498
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,400
out of your questionnaire and then

499
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,839
schedule another meeting with us we'll

500
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,599
sit down with you and go over any gaps

501
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
or questions that you have and at that

502
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
point then we're done you should have

503
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,880
all the information you need to make

504
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
sure that your assessment's done you can

505
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
prove the auditors that you've done it

506
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
and we've given you everything that you

507
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
need to make sure that

508
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,400
you're comfortable doing business with

509
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
us

510
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
and the problem we that we also saw was

511
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,880
that we that most businesses once we did

512
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,799
provide those questionnaires they never

513
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
looked at them

514
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
they get thrown in a folder

515
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
stuck somewhere when their sock 2 audit

516
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,679
came up they would throw it at the

517
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,440
auditor the order so you did your vendor

518
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
risk assessment great we're done you

519
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
passed right so that was a big problem

520
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
we did not like that they didn't like it

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
and it was a complete waste of time for

522
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
both parties involved

523
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
and this is just a view of the cable

524
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
contents of a typical sock ii report

525
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
this happens to be graylog's sock 2

526
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,480
report from the other year on the left

527
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
is a table of contents and you can see

528
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,520
typically these are

529
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
rather long reports several hundred

530
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,600
pages typically this is a short one by

531
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
most standards and on the right what you

532
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,919
see is one of the common controls and

533
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,360
it's broken down so that you see what

534
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
the control is

535
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
what the policies are that are in place

536
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,799
or procedures how they were tested by

537
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,799
the auditor and then what the results

538
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
were for each of those tests so as you

539
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,559
can see it's pretty detailed and there's

540
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
typically

541
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,679
depending on the number of trust

542
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,440
services criteria that you look at

543
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,280
there's probably

544
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
three or four hundred items in a sock to

545
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
report that you could be evaluated on

546
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
depending on the scope of the of the

547
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,120
audit

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
so another problem we ran across is

549
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
these questionnaires

550
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
we we basically again they were they

551
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,880
were

552
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,039
the rehash of the sock 2 framework in a

553
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
spreadsheet format fill out the

554
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
spreadsheet what i ended up doing for

555
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,080
most of them it took me five minutes

556
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,600
because i would put in the first answer

557
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,919
csoc2 report

558
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
select all the column control d

559
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
close save email

560
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
and

561
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,760
sooner or later the customers learned

562
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
that they needed to read our sock 2

563
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,799
report because i was not going to take

564
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,360
the time to fill out their questionnaire

565
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
that was already answered in the sock 2

566
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,280
report but a lot of customers would not

567
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
do that some of them would throw their

568
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
weight around the problem is some of

569
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
these customers are very small they

570
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,160
might have been kind of three five

571
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,000
thousand dollars a year in recurring

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,080
revenue others were really large and

573
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
wanted much more attention but at the

574
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
same time we had to build a process that

575
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
that scaled and that's what we ran into

576
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
was figuring out how to do that so that

577
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,799
we could service those 40 000 customers

578
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,360
with the same level of um

579
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,840
of presentation that we were giving to

580
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,080
the bigger customers

581
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
now some customers did use something

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
that was called a sig or cig light i

583
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,720
don't know if you've heard of that

584
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,039
document it's something that's put out

585
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
by shared assessments you can buy a

586
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
subscription to it it runs about six

587
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
thousand dollars a year uh but it's a

588
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
spreadsheet that um

589
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,480
gives you basically a breakdown of all

590
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,919
the security things that you could have

591
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
within an organization but it's it's um

592
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,880
it has macros in it so that you can

593
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
actually if it doesn't apply to your

594
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
organization it pulls all of those

595
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
things out that don't apply and you can

596
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
provide that as a standardized format

597
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,080
for customers so we did fill that out

598
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
and we did do that for customers but

599
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,200
that's a one-time thing you fill it out

600
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
once and then give it to your customers

601
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,760
just like you would a sock to report

602
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
and we did have a case where

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,520
one of our customers this was in the

604
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
finance area

605
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
they hired a third party risk assessment

606
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
company do a risk assessment of us

607
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
didn't tell us they were doing this

608
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,799
i get an email like on a thursday

609
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
afternoon the email comes in from this

610
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
third party and it says

611
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,039
here's what you're going to do for us

612
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,760
and it listed out you're going to spend

613
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
40 hours

614
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,559
in the next

615
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,679
eight weeks

616
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,919
interviewing all of your internal

617
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,520
stakeholders so the people that run the

618
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
services the service owners within the

619
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
company you're going to provide

620
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,280
artifacts for evidence and you're going

621
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
to do all of these things to help us

622
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
provide this documentation for our

623
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,919
customer

624
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,880
and i looked at this thing and i'm like

625
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
you're basically wanting us to redo an

626
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,720
entire audit just so you can do this

627
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
vendor risk management

628
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
process for your customer this thing's

629
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
moving here a little bit

630
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,039
for your customer

631
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
so i emailed them back and i said

632
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,400
basically let's schedule a meeting

633
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,159
we got on that meeting and they started

634
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,600
going through their little spiel and i

635
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
said let's hold on here a second first

636
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
we're not doing any of that

637
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,440
they're like why you have to so we don't

638
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
have to do any of that you're not paying

639
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
for it we don't have the resources to do

640
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
it and this customer is giving us like

641
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,880
six grand a year in recurring revenue

642
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
we're going to spend more money doing

643
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,520
this audit that you guys are forcing on

644
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,880
us because you're doing this for this

645
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
third party that we would make in a year

646
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
from that customer so we ended up going

647
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
i told them i told them the same thing i

648
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,840
said here's what i'll do you fill out

649
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,520
the questionnaire based on the stock 2

650
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
report that i give you we'll schedule a

651
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
couple more meetings and i'll answer any

652
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
of the gaps that you have in that

653
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
process and then you can go back to your

654
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,440
customer and give them all the data they

655
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
want but that's all we're doing and

656
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,880
they're like well you have to do this so

657
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,559
go back to your customer

658
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,080
so we called the customer and just told

659
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,919
them we're not doing that

660
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
because well we paid this company so

661
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
it's not my problem you paid a company

662
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,200
based on what they said they were going

663
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,039
to get you get done and where you didn't

664
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,640
agree to that we don't have a contract

665
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
with you to do that and we're not doing

666
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
those things for you so it ended up that

667
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,400
we got through the whole process we kept

668
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
the customer the customer was happy with

669
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
what we gave them they learned a lesson

670
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,000
by not hiring this third party to do it

671
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
for them and everybody ended up being

672
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
better off but you know most people

673
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
won't stand up to these third-party

674
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,960
vendors and we'll just say oh you got to

675
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
do all these things well you have to

676
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,679
look at the bottom line how does it

677
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,919
impact your bottom line and how is it

678
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
helping your business grow versus how is

679
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,159
it detracting from your business and the

680
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,000
problem with these kinds of things that

681
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,320
we found is we want to be spending our

682
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
time

683
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
improving our processes building better

684
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
security and yet we're chasing off after

685
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,520
filling out stupid questionnaires for

686
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,039
customers that will never look at them

687
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,520
again in their life so that was one of

688
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
the that was really an awakening moment

689
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,559
for us and the last thing that came up

690
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
um

691
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,919
here for us was talking about a company

692
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
called bitsight

693
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
we get it

694
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,799
and i don't want to bash the vendor

695
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,039
because i'll i'll caveat this with the

696
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,080
idea that

697
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,440
what bitsight and what some of these

698
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
companies do has value but the way they

699
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,559
run their business and the way they try

700
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,640
to bring on new customers is not

701
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,480
conducive to growing that business they

702
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
provide a very valuable service if you

703
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,799
wish to subscribe to it they give you a

704
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,840
risk score a security score if you will

705
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,760
based on everything they find on the

706
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
internet that's public facing so imagine

707
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
you go to showdan you scan the internet

708
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
for ip addresses you look at aaron for

709
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,559
all the ips that are swiped to a company

710
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,760
ripe all of these different

711
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
icann organizations that manage ip

712
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
addresses then you go find all those

713
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
resources and you run all of these

714
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,919
different scans against them you compile

715
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,720
all that data and you give them a score

716
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,559
and that's what they're doing here

717
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,279
the problem is

718
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,799
we got this from a customer the customer

719
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,400
said oh your score was i don't know

720
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,720
let's i'll throw out a number 750 and

721
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,520
they wanted a score of well i used 650

722
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,760
and they wanted to score 750. well to

723
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,080
get to that point we had to see the data

724
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,799
so we contact bidsight well you can see

725
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
the data but we'll only let you see it

726
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,799
for 30 days after that you have to pay

727
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
for it

728
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,919
okay what's the cost

729
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,720
60 grand a year to access the data so

730
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,120
that we can service this customer and

731
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,720
get the score down to a level where

732
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,080
they're going to continue to do business

733
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,960
with us

734
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,799
so we got on there

735
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,760
for the 30-day trial we found out that

736
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
all of the stuff that they had assigned

737
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
to us as our company owning was not

738
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
necessarily true we found about a third

739
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
of the domain names that they associated

740
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
with our company weren't even ours they

741
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,760
were other companies elsewhere in the

742
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
country

743
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
ip addresses that have been used by our

744
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,919
company

745
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
10 years ago that hadn't been fixed

746
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
through

747
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
yes sir

748
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,879
yes

749
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,159
you're perceptive

750
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
yeah so you hit that on the head there

751
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,720
but um

752
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
in any case you know that we go through

753
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,559
all of the inventory found i p addresses

754
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,640
things that weren't even ours that were

755
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
lowering our security score so we

756
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,240
tracked the hours it took and it took

757
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
about 200 hours for three members of our

758
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,880
security team to go through all the data

759
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,799
that they had compiled to reduce it down

760
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,600
to what was really ours by then the 30

761
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,320
days was gone and now they were wanting

762
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
us to subscribe to their service so we

763
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,279
could see the data and the

764
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
vulnerabilities so we could remediate

765
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
them to get the score into a level where

766
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
our customer would see that it was

767
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
acceptable the other problem with it is

768
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,679
they give you a score based on the

769
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,480
entirety of the organization and the

770
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
service that this customer was buying

771
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,360
was a very small sub-segment of that ip

772
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,279
space that had very little public

773
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
footprint very little exposure if you

774
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
had just taken the score of that one it

775
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,720
would have been at the top of the level

776
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
but they didn't give you that

777
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
opportunity so then we come to find out

778
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,760
you're allowed to go in there and set up

779
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,679
a profile and tell them well which

780
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,440
things do you want to count toward your

781
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
public score and not so the reality of

782
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,240
it is the scores that you're seeing from

783
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
bitsight are

784
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,799
seriously massaged by the people that

785
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,320
are getting in there and buying that

786
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
data so they're only exposing the things

787
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,440
that they want you to see everything

788
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
else is hidden it's under the counter

789
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,919
it's

790
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,360
behind the scenes that doesn't matter

791
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
that doesn't impact our public services

792
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,880
all of those you know all those old

793
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,360
apache servers all that centos six crap

794
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
that's running back there somewhere else

795
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
that doesn't matter that's not not

796
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,559
important so they only show you the

797
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
score you want to see but in our case we

798
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
we weren't a customer so we had no

799
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,400
insight and no ability to change it so

800
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
all we could do is work on the last

801
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,120
report we had and remediate the things

802
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,039
well the other problem was

803
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,240
their cadence for readjusting your score

804
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,159
is very slow so we could go and

805
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,120
remediate 15 things in a day

806
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
and two months later they would

807
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,279
reevaluate and lower the raise the score

808
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,640
based on the changes they wouldn't

809
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
evaluate it right away

810
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,520
so it was a very

811
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
tough tough situation for us and was a

812
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
tough situation for any business that

813
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
has so imagine bitsight has a customer

814
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,720
they have 20 vendors they want all 20

815
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,919
vendors to

816
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,480
have a score of 700 or better

817
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
and most of them don't well now

818
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
bitsite's got a way to

819
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,559
extort 20 vendors to come on and be

820
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
customers to get at their data so they

821
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
can chase after this one customer that

822
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,799
wants this score at this level it's just

823
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
not a very good situation it's just not

824
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
it's not tenable because

825
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
beyond the fact that there's bid site

826
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
there's about four other providers and

827
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
they all charge about the same amount of

828
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,559
money every year to do these things

829
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
you've got security scorecard you've got

830
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
iss and just

831
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,720
a bit on iss

832
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
everybody has a credit score right

833
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
everybody knows what credit score is

834
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
developed through i think michigan state

835
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
or university of michigan and it's the

836
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,440
standard for how people's credits rating

837
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,159
goes well that same organization is now

838
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,919
developing what's called the iss

839
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,360
security score

840
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
and every company in the world is going

841
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,840
to get one of those scores

842
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
and this company is going to be the

843
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,960
security reporting agency for the

844
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
basically for the entire world

845
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,080
so

846
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
watch out it's coming and it ain't cheap

847
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,480
to get involved with it so if you can

848
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,559
find your iss score and start to lower

849
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,399
it now i would start doing that before

850
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,600
it gets uh

851
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
too expensive to get in there and get at

852
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
it

853
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
if you're a publicly traded company it's

854
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,039
even worse because the iss score is part

855
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,600
of your what's called esg rating how

856
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,200
many of you look at yahoo finance and

857
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
look at stock prices and that sort of

858
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
thing on there

859
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,679
one of the

860
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,600
one of the values for most companies in

861
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
there in the lower right hand side is

862
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,679
called an esg rating it's environmental

863
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
social and governance rating and it's a

864
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
third party

865
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,520
attestation as to how well the company's

866
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
doing in those three areas through a

867
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,200
large set of criteria and stock traders

868
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,039
and investors and all of that use those

869
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,520
esg scores to determine which

870
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
stocks they purchase or which funds they

871
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
invest in so

872
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,720
if you're in a publicly traded company

873
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,039
that's a big deal

874
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
and the last thing we came across in

875
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,120
this whole vendor risk management thing

876
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,039
is believe it or not there's companies

877
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,080
that will

878
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,679
automate

879
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
the security questionnaire answers that

880
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,720
your customers are asking from you you

881
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,480
can pay these third-party companies

882
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,080
money they'll fill out the

883
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
questionnaires on your behalf send them

884
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
off to your customers

885
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,039
and

886
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,640
your customers will get the answers that

887
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
they provide based on your input

888
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,799
so it's pretty bad when we've created a

889
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,640
system that you have to hire somebody

890
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,399
that's an outside third party

891
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,320
to provide these answers to customers

892
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
just to meet a need it just seems

893
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,240
completely ridiculous to me that these

894
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
kinds of things happen and this is the

895
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
way the process works

896
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,399
so so how do we get to

897
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
to what really matters i mean i'll i'll

898
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
pose the question

899
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,559
what what when you're doing a vendor

900
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,799
risk management what what matters to you

901
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,399
and your business

902
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,480
there's a question to answer asking for

903
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,200
for input here

904
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,600
okay that's one area yep

905
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
anything else

906
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
sagan

907
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
yeah yeah so access the data right what

908
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,520
happens to the data or how about

909
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,039
i use you for five years as a vendor and

910
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,640
then i no longer use you what do you do

911
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
with my data after we sever that

912
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
relationship right

913
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
or

914
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,080
you know how much access do you have to

915
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
our data center how much access do you

916
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,080
have to

917
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
our customer data how much access do you

918
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,559
have our source code

919
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,320
if you're a manufacturing company and

920
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
what's your lead time on the parts to

921
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
fulfill my orders how's what's that look

922
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,919
like over time right looking at a key

923
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,600
performance indicator kind of things

924
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,679
like that do these questionnaires and do

925
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,279
this does the vendor risk management

926
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
process address any of that

927
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,279
so

928
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,960
in my mind a lot of this vendor risk

929
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
management has become a money maker for

930
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,200
the vendors that offer those services

931
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,120
and they don't really do a great service

932
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
for the companies that are

933
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
supposed to be looking at real risk

934
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,559
right i mean look at what's going on now

935
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,559
for example we have a

936
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,440
a small internet business and we provide

937
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
internet service in a small part of

938
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
downtown we cannot buy routers we cannot

939
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,159
buy switches

940
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,159
there's nothing nothing there now how

941
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,200
many people if you go back and look at

942
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
their vendor risk management of those

943
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
vendors three years ago or a year ago

944
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,159
would have said yeah i worry about

945
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,440
whether they can supply my needs

946
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,679
nobody's right they're all looking at

947
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,840
security related things and now we can't

948
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,279
as a business make money because this

949
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,279
vendor can't supply us with

950
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,880
things that we need because they can't

951
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
get the parts that they need to fulfill

952
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,039
their orders so it's more than just

953
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,480
looking at

954
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
do you have routers and firewalls and do

955
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,919
you have you know do you rotate your

956
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,080
passwords and you do quarterly reviews

957
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
and that sort of thing there's much more

958
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,399
to this process and that's that's

959
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:27,919
my point of this whole talk is really to

960
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,519
get people to think about how that

961
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,519
impacts your business short term and

962
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,679
long term and how can we get around that

963
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,919
and get at those answers and can you

964
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,320
solve those problems no but at least

965
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
you're aware if

966
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,080
you know if you know that this company's

967
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
financial

968
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,799
status

969
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,240
isn't such that they could buy enough

970
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,840
parts to fulfill the order you might

971
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,440
want to find another vendor right but

972
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,039
are people uncovering that in these

973
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,880
vendor risk management

974
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,760
exercises i would say probably not

975
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,519
right

976
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,279
so what should we be doing how can we do

977
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,360
it better how can we make this process

978
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,200
so that we can still meet the needs for

979
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,760
compliance and yet

980
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,120
help our business actually get some

981
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
beneficial data out of the time that we

982
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,919
put into doing these assessments any

983
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,240
ideas

984
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
russell's got all kinds

985
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,679
now that are ideas what they're calling

986
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:28,880
people they will share

987
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,440
their reports from their stock yep

988
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,200
something that i've yep to implement is

989
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,679
creating that questionnaire but having

990
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,600
someone on my team

991
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,719
try to find all the answers

992
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,399
yes in some ways but again it doesn't

993
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
scale right so

994
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
it goes on to the next

995
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,399
you segue into the next thing there was

996
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,599
i don't know if anybody listens to the

997
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,040
cso series

998
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,359
uh david spark and his group out in

999
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,679
california do the cso series every week

1000
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,879
podcast

1001
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,320
really good information if you're in

1002
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,159
security and compliance if you're

1003
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,918
dealing at managerial levels but this

1004
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,239
guy nick selby was on there he's the

1005
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,480
chief security officer at paxos trust

1006
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,918
and they were talking about this very

1007
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,399
topic right and his his statement here

1008
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,719
is really kind of kind of confounding it

1009
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,239
said this is how we should be doing

1010
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,480
instead the second half instead we have

1011
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,159
spreadsheets from hell that are created

1012
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,719
by accountants delivered by auditors to

1013
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,040
measure cybersecurity risk none of these

1014
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,280
people have anything to do with risk

1015
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,200
or the assessment of the risk so what

1016
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,839
can we do to make this easier so and it

1017
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,680
can't be more than 10 questions tops

1018
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,920
that's his his take on it right so

1019
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,160
really what it comes down to is

1020
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
doing what russell said you provide a

1021
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,839
portal to give people access to your

1022
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,280
documentation

1023
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,760
your your sock reports your iso reports

1024
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,599
maybe you have a sig form that's filled

1025
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,839
out maybe you have a specific security

1026
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,280
document that talks about some more

1027
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
details about the controls about a

1028
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
particular service but then you have to

1029
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,920
go and figure out how if i'm if i'm

1030
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
vetting a vendor how can i ask them the

1031
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,160
right questions that are relevant to the

1032
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
scope of the services that they're

1033
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
providing for me

1034
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
and i have actually an example of that i

1035
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
pulled it up on the

1036
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,640
new

1037
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
i don't want to be active

1038
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,760
let's see i pull up the questionnaire

1039
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,160
that he had here and if you look at it

1040
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,839
it's you know it's got some basic

1041
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,040
information you obviously have to know

1042
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,960
who to contact at the vendor the vendor

1043
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,280
name that sort of thing then they ask

1044
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,880
first question what services does the

1045
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
vendor provide right i mean obviously if

1046
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,079
you if you're delivering boxes to

1047
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
somebody via truck you don't have to

1048
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,520
care much about a whole lot of the

1049
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,079
security questions that that vendor

1050
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,920
might be exposed to then they ask a bit

1051
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,720
and this is specific to um their type of

1052
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,800
business yes but what kind of encryption

1053
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,400
happens here what kind of storage

1054
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,599
architecture do you use vpns how do you

1055
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,599
handle lease privilege

1056
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
how do you handle static credentials how

1057
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,359
do you handle secrets

1058
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,400
so credentials within code and then how

1059
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
do you handle your policies and your

1060
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,599
programs do you have secure coding

1061
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,560
training

1062
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,720
give us a little details on that

1063
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,560
now in this case they have a requirement

1064
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,720
for linter

1065
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
which is used in

1066
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,760
code compiling and then do they do you

1067
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
do static security scanning of your code

1068
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,160
you do dependency scanning

1069
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,520
and then they looks at a couple of

1070
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,119
questions that they have is really only

1071
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,880
20 questions but that's that's all they

1072
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
ask and then if there's more questions

1073
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,839
they may dive into a little bit more

1074
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,680
detail with that vendor on these things

1075
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,079
but they're not going through that whole

1076
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,720
200 300 question ordeal for them

1077
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,320
somebody could fill this out probably in

1078
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,079
15 minutes and get it back to them right

1079
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,160
and this is pretty benign and pretty

1080
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,880
easy to do so this is where we have to

1081
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
go we have to tailor the questions that

1082
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,359
we ask our vendors

1083
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,200
to what that vendor provides for us and

1084
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,119
what the risk is to the business right i

1085
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,079
mean

1086
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
you know if they're providing bottled

1087
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,599
water to our business

1088
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,040
you know all i need all i care about is

1089
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
how do they vet their employees that are

1090
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520
coming into my office space that's

1091
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,800
really all i care about if the water

1092
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,000
doesn't show up it's not the end of the

1093
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
world i can drink water out of the

1094
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
spigot right i mean

1095
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
i wouldn't spend more than five minutes

1096
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,400
vetting that vendor now if this is a

1097
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
vendor that's you know bringing in

1098
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,520
outside consultants to work in our you

1099
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,680
know pci environment and they're logging

1100
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
in and connecting remotely and doing all

1101
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,400
those sorts of things i'm going to vet

1102
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,640
that vendor a whole lot harder but again

1103
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,119
one size does not fit all so that's

1104
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,119
that's really the point of getting at

1105
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,040
this the vendor risk management process

1106
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
has become this

1107
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
hey we're the we're the managers of the

1108
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,880
company you guys that in it and you guys

1109
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,040
in in security and auditing have to do

1110
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,400
this thing this way and if anybody

1111
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,079
deviates from that then tell them to go

1112
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,160
screw off and they have to do this thing

1113
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,400
and it's like it just doesn't work and

1114
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
we have to get to the point where

1115
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,240
we're assessing the real risk of the

1116
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,480
vendor because i i would say that we're

1117
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,119
missing a lot of the big risks we're not

1118
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,599
covering the real risks that matter with

1119
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,920
every vendor right if we're spending all

1120
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,320
this time we're just

1121
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,839
pulling the wool over our eyes saying

1122
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,440
we're doing a process we're doing a good

1123
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,200
thing but when

1124
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
you know what hits the fan somebody's

1125
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,400
going to go back and look did you assess

1126
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
this vendor correctly and

1127
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,359
maybe we should have done a little

1128
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,280
better job doing this so

1129
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,640
that's really the point of this whole

1130
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,760
talk and i

1131
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
i don't have anything else as far as

1132
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
content here

1133
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,480
but getting to the last

1134
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
last slide here how do we fix the

1135
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,680
problem these are just thoughts

1136
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
questions thoughts i can put this back

1137
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,960
on full screen because it's showing a

1138
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
little screen

1139
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,400
there we go so getting it getting it the

1140
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,000
whole idea how do we get past just

1141
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,680
checking a box for compliance right

1142
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
that's why we do it that's why we have

1143
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,359
to do it but the reality is why we have

1144
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,720
to do it is because we want our

1145
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
businesses to prosper we want our

1146
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,240
businesses to know what the risks are

1147
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,000
when it's operating we want to be able

1148
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to have a plan to get around those risks

1149
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
if something critical happens to the

1150
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,760
business it's not about just compliance

1151
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,920
it's about the impact and the down the

1152
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,079
road path that it has on the business

1153
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,839
our security scores all that matter i

1154
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,839
would say probably not there's more to

1155
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,440
risk than just looking at security

1156
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,079
scores now again going back we're all in

1157
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,400
security so that's probably top of mind

1158
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,640
but there's a lot more to it than that

1159
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,000
what happens with those questionnaires

1160
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
what value do third party vendors

1161
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
provide some do good good work some

1162
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,560
don't you know russell brought up the

1163
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,800
idea of having a portal where you can

1164
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
provide that information and we we use

1165
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
one of those at greylock and it works

1166
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,160
out very well when customers ask for

1167
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,440
something i give them a log into the

1168
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,119
portal it provides them all of their

1169
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,119
information and then we meet after that

1170
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,480
and go over any other questions and

1171
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
concerns that they have what are the

1172
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
five to ten key questions you can ask as

1173
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,079
a risk assessor to get at the

1174
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,810
at the level of of um

1175
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,359
[Music]

1176
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,280
sophistication of somebody's risk

1177
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
program or of their security program in

1178
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,880
general you know how do we stop

1179
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,720
evaluating these audits the audits that

1180
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,319
we're doing i mean they cost a lot of

1181
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,280
money you know a stock two ought to 25

1182
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,680
30 000 for a small company it's not

1183
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
that's not penis it's plus the time to

1184
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,000
get the audit done you know a pci audit

1185
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,440
could cost that much or more depending

1186
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,040
on the scope of the audit

1187
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,760
and

1188
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,359
by then by your

1189
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,280
customers not valuing that or not

1190
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,599
understanding what those audits mean

1191
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,240
we're just wasting that money as well

1192
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,400
you know some vendors simply presume

1193
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
uh the businesses are going to purchase

1194
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,839
their services because they come to

1195
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,800
market

1196
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,520
i mean you know we got rsa coming up in

1197
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
in uh june right how many of those

1198
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
vendors will we create something new you

1199
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,560
got to have this thing to be able to

1200
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
secure your network right

1201
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,920
or your your business probably not

1202
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,520
you know and some

1203
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,800
how do we make how do we make these

1204
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
processes efficient and scalable i mean

1205
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,240
if you've got four or five vendors no

1206
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,560
big deal but if you start having 40 000

1207
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,480
customers asking you for your security

1208
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,720
posture you know that that's a big deal

1209
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,319
and i think amazon and some of those

1210
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,920
companies do it well

1211
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,839
and i doubt that they would they would

1212
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,280
submit

1213
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,880
to anybody asking them a security

1214
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,920
question they're going to go here it is

1215
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,599
on our website this is what you get you

1216
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,680
get what you get and it's there but they

1217
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,359
do a dang good job of putting it out

1218
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,480
there so

1219
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
that's all i have but if anybody has any

1220
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,240
questions comments i'm

1221
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,160
here for a few more minutes i'm got 20

1222
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,799
minutes left so

1223
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,599
back there

1224
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,599
um

1225
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,400
so you're doing like pre-audit

1226
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,319
assessments to get them prepared

1227
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,680
oh full audits okay cool

1228
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,400
yep

1229
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,960
okay okay so you're certifying the

1230
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,440
auditors okay

1231
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,359
um

1232
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,920
um

1233
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,599
it depends on the vendor and i guess my

1234
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,200
whole point is

1235
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,119
you know the sock 2 sets a baseline that

1236
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,520
should give you a

1237
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
an overall assessment of security

1238
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,040
posture so that you can spend the time

1239
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
asking the very questions that you're

1240
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
asking right the deeper questions

1241
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,920
instead of making somebody go back and

1242
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,920
say do you do these things

1243
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,280
you've got that already covered you've

1244
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,240
got the baseline you've got a good solid

1245
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
here's what we do generally here's our

1246
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,560
policies procedures our governance now

1247
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,119
if you have more technical questions

1248
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,160
and that's where i was going with

1249
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,920
creating a more

1250
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
service oriented

1251
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,839
security statement about a particular

1252
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,440
service so let's say it's encrypted

1253
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
email we use xyz encryption the the

1254
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,359
data is stored in this format the keys

1255
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,280
are stored here here's how we do access

1256
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
control getting at the meat of all of

1257
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
those questions that you would be

1258
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,839
concerned about right

1259
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,160
yeah

1260
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,839
and the problem i saw with a lot of them

1261
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,920
was people would purchase something like

1262
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,440
one of the services we offered was spam

1263
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,720
filtering

1264
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,000
well they would offer what kind of

1265
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
encryption do you for spam filtering

1266
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,280
none it's

1267
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,119
i mean this question is not relevant

1268
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,160
right

1269
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,640
so so the question has to be tailored to

1270
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,240
an understanding of the services and

1271
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,079
that's where the disconnect is the

1272
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,760
people asking the questions don't

1273
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,960
understand

1274
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,800
the technical implications of a service

1275
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,119
so they just throw some really technical

1276
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,560
survey at somebody and the person

1277
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,760
looking at goes

1278
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,680
this makes no sense from the context of

1279
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,599
the service that we're providing to you

1280
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,079
in this case

1281
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,119
yes

1282
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,480
is

1283
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,480
middle to lower and i think it just

1284
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,160
shows you that you paid attention to it

1285
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,920
and you've covered the basics you've got

1286
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
the governance in place you've addressed

1287
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,599
the security you're concerned about

1288
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,880
those things and now maybe the

1289
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
implementation of more technical

1290
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,280
controls has to have a little bit more

1291
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,200
scrutiny like what you're talking about

1292
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
but if you don't even have a basic you

1293
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,560
know understanding of how to

1294
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
do the basics from a sock 2 perspective

1295
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,400
or an iso perspective they're not going

1296
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
to have a clue about the other things

1297
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,040
and even if they have all those

1298
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,280
technical controls in place the business

1299
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,440
operations are going to be such a mess

1300
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,040
that i wouldn't trust them to begin with

1301
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,640
right i mean it doesn't matter how

1302
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,160
encrypted the data is if they don't take

1303
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,599
care of their laptops or if they don't

1304
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,359
take care of their governance process or

1305
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,119
if their hr processes aren't solid so

1306
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,800
i guess i see it as kind of a tiered

1307
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,040
approach and that's sort of like the

1308
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,119
five layers of maturity and you know and

1309
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,839
that and that are is it repeatable is it

1310
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,760
you know all of those things and really

1311
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,440
sock two is kind of in that one and a

1312
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,280
half to two and a half range on that

1313
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,359
scale that's kind of the way i see it

1314
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
and most businesses

1315
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,359
that are small vendors can't afford to

1316
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,760
even get to that right and that's and

1317
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
now you've got things like cmmc

1318
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,559
compliance that are going to come down

1319
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,559
the pike so anybody that's doing

1320
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,720
you know work for government contractors

1321
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,240
going to have to do that you're not

1322
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,920
going to have an option and once they

1323
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,319
certify the auditors it's going to come

1324
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,400
pretty quickly so

1325
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,319
i hope i answered your question but and

1326
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,079
i'm not saying it's you know i'm not

1327
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,440
saying that stock 2 is the only thing

1328
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,720
that matters but it's really it's about

1329
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,319
building the trust to a level that's

1330
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,160
here now we can dig into the stuff that

1331
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,559
really matters as opposed to saying well

1332
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,920
do you do this thing and this thing in

1333
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,280
this thing well yeah we do all that

1334
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,599
stuff so let's now get on to what really

1335
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,520
matters and separate us from just the

1336
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,800
basic business operations

1337
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,319
anything else i appreciate your time

1338
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,839
looks like we're

1339
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,520
already open they're not over i've got

1340
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,359
10 minutes left but anybody have any

1341
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,400
other questions comments concerns

1342
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,720
a number uh

1343
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,960
yeah and i'll tell you one that's better

1344
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,960
if you go look at risk um security

1345
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,599
scorecard that's much better much better

1346
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,720
detail much better relevancy

1347
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,760
so

1348
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,280
yeah but it is good for that and if you

1349
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,480
get the value out of it that's what

1350
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,800
matters right

1351
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,680
that they need to step up their game

1352
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,200
that's a question that that

1353
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,720
has to be answered by the people that

1354
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,240
run your company right they have to

1355
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,760
understand what is at risk tolerance

1356
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,040
what are they willing to live with what

1357
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,400
risks are they willing to take and if

1358
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,920
you come to them and say hey you know

1359
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,280
this guy's running a server out of his

1360
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
basement on a you know a cable modem

1361
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,119
with no security not behind a firewall

1362
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,720
it's got our critical

1363
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,359
you know pii for our employees on it and

1364
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,280
your upper management doesn't see that

1365
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,400
as a serious risk

1366
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,839
then i think it's a hopeless case

1367
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,000
um but you've got to train you've got to

1368
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
train the upper management the

1369
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,760
executives in the company to look at

1370
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,000
risk that they they own the risk and

1371
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,119
they don't know it right a lot of

1372
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,240
businesses the

1373
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,680
the upper level management doesn't

1374
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,599
understand that they own the risk and

1375
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,960
there's that whole

1376
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,599
area of due diligence and due care right

1377
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,960
and once they're aware you've done the

1378
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,040
due diligence you've found the risk

1379
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,800
now they know about it if they don't

1380
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
exercise due care they're negligent or

1381
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,559
could be criminally liable for anything

1382
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,720
that happens because of that and i don't

1383
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,319
say that to be like oh it's black and

1384
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,880
white it's not but it's a serious

1385
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,640
serious attention needs to be given to

1386
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,480
those risks that you present how do you

1387
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,920
present them well

1388
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,599
i don't have it in this slide deck but

1389
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,400
go look up how to do a bow tie risk

1390
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,160
assessment

1391
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,920
so you would go and find a list of risks

1392
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,440
and pick every risk and then put it

1393
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,599
through this bow tie exercise and it's a

1394
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,440
good way to communicate to your c-level

1395
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,720
folks

1396
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,040
what happens if a risk is realized what

1397
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
are the controls we have in place now

1398
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,880
what kinds of things could stop that

1399
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,800
risk from happening if that risk is

1400
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
realized the center of the bow tie

1401
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,960
what does it take to recover from that

1402
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,960
risk and then how do we measure that

1403
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,040
risk over time is it getting lower or

1404
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,359
higher and we look at that over the long

1405
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,040
haul and that's the language that they

1406
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,880
like to understand right they look at

1407
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,960
key performance indicators they look at

1408
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,559
dollar values to the business

1409
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,559
reputational risk

1410
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,240
they don't care about technical things

1411
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,839
if you talk to them in technical terms

1412
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,440
the c-level folks are never going to

1413
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,520
respond to that right they they they

1414
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,680
care about dollars and reputation so if

1415
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,200
you can convert it to that i think

1416
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,640
you'll you'll get some leeway and

1417
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,720
getting them to pay attention to it how

1418
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,680
do you get your vendor to up their score

1419
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,079
i mean i don't know that's again that's

1420
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,520
for your company to decide but

1421
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,599
you know my case i look at them and i i

1422
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,520
look at we we have minimum standards and

1423
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,880
if they don't meet those standards we'll

1424
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,480
look at the exception to try and figure

1425
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,480
out what it is is it really a big risk

1426
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,559
or is it just some oh hey one off you

1427
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,839
got this company over here that's

1428
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,599
lowered your score to this level but

1429
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,119
again we don't look solely at those

1430
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,960
security scores either

1431
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,079
right we need to know that there's

1432
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,359
somebody in that company that

1433
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,880
understands that they're managing risk

1434
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,400
they're managing security for that

1435
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
organization

1436
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,079
all right i don't have anything else any

1437
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,319
other questions

1438
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,079
[Applause]

1439
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,110
