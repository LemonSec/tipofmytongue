23
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
really a great event that a lot of

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
people hopefully took some good

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
experiences home from

26
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
so some statistics as we ran the numbers

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
from this year compared to previous

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,799
years this is our year six of the event

29
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
going into this recovery we knew there's

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,719
some obstacles that we're facing

31
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,280
uh previously we had seen a massive

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,758
growth we expected a drop off this year

33
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,080
and we did see that drop off however the

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
ones who did show up had an amazing time

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,280
as we've heard you have seen our great

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
keynotes the saturday morning keynote

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
also was not recorded so if you had a

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
chance to sit through that that was a

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
lifetime experience

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
consider yourself

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,879
lucky for that

42
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,400
uh so

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
this is also an event that we really

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
strongly believed to hold in person

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
looking at virtual in 2020 virtual 2021

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000

so we'll see you all

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,800
awesome thank you

322
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,720
all right thank you awesome stuff uh if

323
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
you hadn't seen the badges as you're

324
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,720
floating around you also noticed we had

325
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
the theme of the election security

326
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
from 2020 and 2021 and 2022. so

327
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,079
these were an awesome fun time for us to

328
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
organize and design and just brainstorm

329
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
these cool designs the idea if you not

330
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,079
catch it is it is a voting between a

331
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,560
crab and a seagull

332
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
so there was a competition between the

333
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
two

334
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,639
however every now and then the

335
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,680
volunteers will come in and have a

336
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,199
hanging chad there because they didn't

337
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
know how to vote so

338

that we come back in 2023 with an even

403
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
better experience how do we top the

404
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,440
great stuff we're already doing now i'm

405
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,360
not sure but we're gonna figure out how

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
and as well as the overall talks

407
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
themselves and trainings there is a form

408
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
there that you can fill out for each

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
individual talk that you went to

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
please give feedback we provide that

411
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
back to the speakers if they request it

412
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
positive negative this is all room to

413
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,920
improve for all of us you saw many

414
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
first-time speakers here you saw many

415
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
local speakers here you saw many with

416
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,519
some great ideas that they're still

417
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
trying to hash out but there's genius

418
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,480
work that there is going into play

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,519
so we definitely want to give them the

420
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,600
feedback and really encourage them to

421
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
build out because this is an environment

422
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
where we all are protecting each other

423
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,519
to protect the world

424
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,199
it's big statements but it really is

425
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,680
true so thank you

426
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,839
