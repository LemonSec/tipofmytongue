1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,320
so

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,599
if you're in the right spot we're going

3
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,920
to be talking about forecasting cyber

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,599
attacks with mathematical models

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,480
my name is charlene dever vasquez here's

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
my corporate name i'll have my contact

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
information on the last slide

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,000
the reason i wanted to talk to you today

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
is because in this past year i created

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
this thing called a probabilistic risk

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
modeling for cyber and that's one of the

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
models out of this framework is what i'm

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,199
going to be showing and talking to you

14
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
about today

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,199
i also recently wrote a book ensuring

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
your business success with risk informed

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
decisions the easy way to quantify risk

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
what i tend to focus on is making it

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,879
easy to do the work and to understand

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
what value it has for you and in your

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
organization

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
so i have a lot of information i want to

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
try and share with you today in this

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
session specifically what i want to kind

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
of go over is using minor attack model

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,479
to build up a framework of a scenario

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,640
that you want to model the probability

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
of this

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,479
attack occurring in your organization

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,080
the goal of this whole activity the

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
reason why we would try and quantify

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
risk in this way the reason that we

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,680
would try and model cyber attacks is to

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
give your organization time

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,840
to come up with mitigations and

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
strategies to avoid that attack

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,119
occurring in your organization

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
at the end of this

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
i also have something very that i'm very

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
excited about a new kind of model that i

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
want to share with you the math of which

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,040
was only theorized last year so the

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
first section of this is going to be

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
something very applicable

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
and if you stay around to the last slide

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,079
you'll have a link where you can

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
actually download the attack model that

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,920
i'm talking about in this speech you can

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
actually take that take all the

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,360
techniques and the strategies i give you

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
with this take it back and you can

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
actually play with it and use it

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
yourself so i'm going to give you that

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
but then at the very end i want to show

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
you this new model

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,239
so first let's talk about methods so

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,080
when i'm talking about mathematical

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
models i'm talking about using the math

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
of probability and so this first part

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
i'm going to describe the methods of

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
probability don't worry there's no math

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,239
in here well i lie there's one equation

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,800
and it's very simple

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
so what we're going to be doing with

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
these models is forecasting risk so

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
we're trying to look ahead of time

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
at what the probability what is one

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,000
potential

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
event outcome in the future that might

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
happen we want to try and forecast that

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
so that we can develop mitigations and

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
prepare ourselves so that we can avoid

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
that outcome does that make sense so

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
when we talk about forecasting it's kind

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
of like the weather we were just talking

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,519
when we got prepared to come down this

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,720
weekend there was no rain in the

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
forecast today it's going to rain right

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
so the forecast changes as events occur

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
and as we have more information so when

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
we start to do a forecast we really

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,519
don't have to have a lot of information

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,959
we don't have to have almost any

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,120
information at all in fact if i don't

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
have any information i can create a

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,440
forecast that is very accurate

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,319
i do that because i have a broader range

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,200
of risk that i'm forecasting as i have

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
more information i become precise and my

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
range becomes smaller does that make

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
sense let me say that again

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
i don't have to have a lot of

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
information

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,560
i can be accurate on an initial

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
assessment because the range is broad

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,760
as i have more information i'm going to

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
become more precise and my range will

98
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,519
become more narrow

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
okay if you can grasp this one key

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
concept you will be several steps ahead

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
of a lot of organizations who struggle

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
with trying to forecast because they

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,680
think they have to have a lot of

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
information you don't you don't have to

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
have a lot of information the math is

106
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
what will get you

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
from i know nothing to i know something

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
i know more and now i know a lot more

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
all right so we're going to start

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,200
talking about these methods and you're

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
going to want to become comfortable in

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
relying on the underlying math so when

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,079
we talk about this range they're really

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
usually three key values you want to

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
think of what's my worst case my best

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,960
case and my most likely

117
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
what can the models actually tell us

118
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
they're not really a crystal ball

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
they're only going to give out based on

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
what you put in to the models but what

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
they can tell you dependably what the

122
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,440
math can tell you is the probability of

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
an event

124
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
very solid

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
the number of events that will occur

126
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
again very solid this math is very old

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
it's very dependable what is the outcome

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
of two probabilities in that case think

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,199
of a threat actor in your security

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
defense posture right what's the outcome

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
of these two probabilities

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
these are the three basic things that

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
all probability models can give you

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
with these you can do a great deal of

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
forecasting so as we start talking about

136
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,800
the language in these models i'm going

137
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,639
to give you some terminology and i know

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
these words might be used differently in

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
other places but for our purposes today

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
a threat is another way of saying i have

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
a weakness or a vulnerability that's a

142
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
threat

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
the likelihood is the likelihood that

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
the threat actor having access would be

145
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
able to leverage that threat against me

146
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
so we're going to be talking about a

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,759
threat

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,919
and a likelihood these are the two key

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,680
values we're going to look at

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
and as you start thinking long term why

151
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,840
am i doing this i want to build up

152
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
mitigations i want to avoid this

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
potential outcome

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
if you can eliminate either the threat

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
or the likelihood the risk no longer

156
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,360
exists you have to have both

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
so some of the probabilistic methods and

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
there are three here that i'll highlight

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
these are the three main

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
and i'll go over each of these almost

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
all of your probabilistic models are

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
going to use one of these at a time or

163
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,960
you might have an

164
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
opportunity to use both of these

165
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
depending on how you're coming at the

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,639
threat so let's start with a bayesian

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
joint probability

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
a joint probability is where i have two

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
data sets and they overlap i could just

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
call this a joint probability and and be

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
done with that but i put the word

172
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
bayesian in front of this and i want to

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
give you a little background

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
so the math of bayesian theory was

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
mathematician who wanted to model how we

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,919
actually learn mathematically how could

177
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,720
i express the learning process and so

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
the learning process mathematically is a

179
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
lot like the scientific process i have

180
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
an initial belief i do some analysis and

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
then i have a posterior belief which

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,479
becomes

183
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,039
my new beginning belief and the cycle

184
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,840
repeats so when we say a bayesian joint

185
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,000
probability what we're really saying is

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
this is an iterative process and you

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
will repeat this every time you have new

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
information or something has changed or

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
you want to look at it again so these

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
kinds of mathematical models are not a

191
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,280
one and done like a compliance

192
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
assessment they should be an ongoing

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
thing that you're doing in your

194
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
organization continually

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
so the bayesian joint probability we're

196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
going to get into more and this is going

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
to be the one that you're going to use

198
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
with the model that i'm going to give

199
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,520
you this joint probability the second

200
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
one is called a monte carlo simulation

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
now the math for monte carlo let's see

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
so bayesian was in the 17 1800s monte

203
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
carlo was in the 1930s so they were

204
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
trying to mathematically understand the

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
dispersion of neutrons think nuclear

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
reaction

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,759
so there's a lot of uncertainty in that

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
and so this math this mathematical model

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
is what they use to gain more assurance

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
and understanding about this very

211
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
uncertain process and the way that it

212
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
works you have to have a model to do

213
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
this you can't just do this in your head

214
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,360
you have to have a model and what it

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
does is you give it

216
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
your worst case your best case you give

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
it a range a bottom and an upper range

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,479
and within that range it will generate

219
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
thousands of probabilities like random

220
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
numbers within that range it'll never go

221
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
above never go below

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
so in the

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
framework that i use we generate a

224
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
thousand probabilities these executed

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
the push of a button so within that

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
range the math behind this takes the

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
thousand probabilities generates them

228
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,000
and then it correlates cross-references

229
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
them and then it charts them out of all

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,520
of these

231
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
which ones occurred most frequently

232
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,639
the chart of that is the third thing

233
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,919
here which is the probability

234
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,680
distribution that's the output of the

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
monte carlo and that gives you think of

236
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
it in a bar stack chart how all of these

237
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
probabilities occurred which ones

238
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
occurred most frequently so now you have

239
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,279
actually generated something that

240
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
graphically represents to you the

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
probability of what was previously

242
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
unknown that's pretty cool

243
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
so this is a joint probability an easy

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,839
way to think of this is the venn

245
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,600
diagram and i think somebody else had

246
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
this beautiful math on their slide so

247
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
this is the

248
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
the bayesian formula

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
there are actually several that you can

250
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,279
use to express exactly the same thing

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
when we read the equation it says the

252
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
probability of the joint union between a

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,839
and b is equal to the probability of a

254
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
given what we know about b times the

255
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
probability of b

256
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
let's simplify that

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,760
so instead we're going to use this

258
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,839
equation

259
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,279
times likelihood equals risk that's it

260
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,120
so if you can get your your mind around

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
this very simple equation using the

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
terminology that i gave you threat as a

263
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
weakness likelihood is the likelihood

264
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
that a threat actor is going to leverage

265
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
that against me and use this one

266
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
equation you'll be able to quantify the

267
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
risk of any cyber attack and i'll show

268
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,640
you how we do this so think of this as

269
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
we said a venn diagram

270
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
where a and b overlap that middle

271
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
section is the risk

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
anything that is outside that to the

273
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
left or the right is not a risk it might

274
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
be a threat it might be a likelihood

275
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,800
but it is not

276
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,279
the risk

277
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
it's usually at this point where people

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
start thinking okay i've got a basic

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
equation i understand some of the

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
methodology under the hood how am i

281
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
going to come up with an estimate i how

282
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
do i how do i know what the numbers

283
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
should be for the estimate

284
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
well i'm going to give you a really easy

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,200
way to do that

286
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
almost everybody uses qualitative

287
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
analytics so everybody's kind of

288
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
familiar with this one through five

289
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,160
scale of risk very low through very high

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
if you just take that one through five

291
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
scale and you convert those to 20

292
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
ranges

293
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,519
you have ranges

294
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
so now when you're having a conversation

295
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,040
with leadership or with operation staff

296
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
and you say well

297
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,800
what do you think our our threat is in

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,279
this area what do you think you know the

299
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
percentages of our systems are that have

300
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
these kinds of vulnerabilities they may

301
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,600
say something like well we think that's

302
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,480
a very low risk great

303
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
does 0 to 20 sound about right for you

304
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
and this is how you can begin to have

305
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,480
these conversations moving from

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
a qualitative

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,120
set of language to

308
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
quantifying it

309
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
now again we said these are going to be

310
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,079
initial estimates and our ranges can be

311
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
quite broad we narrow them as we go in

312
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
so one thing i also want to add is we're

313
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
talking about initial estimates

314
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,560
a lot of people will think well if i'm

315
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,839
going to do this i have to have a lot of

316
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,240
data has to be very detailed there's

317
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
tremendous value in having an initial

318
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,120
estimate and let me explain why

319
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
if you're working with leadership

320
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
they're going to ask you a question off

321
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
the cuff while i saw this attack what's

322
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
the likelihood that could happen to us

323
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,680
so what i'm going to show you here is a

324
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,600
way that you can answer them and fairly

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
quickly

326
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
the value of that initial estimate does

327
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
two things the whole reason we do this

328
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
for leadership is to help them make

329
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
decisions this is a decision support

330
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,600
process

331
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
in the first case they can say well that

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
aligns well with what i think and what

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,680
we expected thank you or they can say

334
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
well that's not quite what i thought it

335
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
might be can you go get some more detail

336
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
and refine this

337
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,200
now you have leadership buy-in we all

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
know how important that is and now you

339
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,200
can go get all the data that you need to

340
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
refine your estimate

341
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,880
does this make sense

342
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
so never be afraid of an initial

343
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,519
estimates tremendous value

344
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
so now you have a way to begin getting

345
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
your ranges so let's do one of these

346
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,560
calculations we're going to do more of

347
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
these as we go along you can calculate

348
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
this in your header if you're like me

349
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
pull out your smartphone

350
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
so let's say that we're

351
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
talking about a likelihood of 80 so in

352
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
other words the likelihood that a threat

353
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
actor

354
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
let's say a cyber criminal having access

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,760
to the threat my weakness what's the

356
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,279
likelihood that they would succeed in

357
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,200
leveraging that against me let's say

358
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,839
that i've got a pretty mature

359
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
security practice in my organization and

360
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
i think that my my weakness my my threat

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,519
level is really pretty low so we'll say

362
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
that's a 20 we're really pretty good so

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
what's the risk

364
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,680
well if i just convert the percentages

365
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,959
to decimal

366
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,560
0.8 times 0.2 is 0.16 your risk value is

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
point 16.

368
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,079
that's not complicated that's pretty

369
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,120
simple

370
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
so if you were asked this question

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
from leadership or a stakeholder

372
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
you could

373
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
very quickly give them an initial

374
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
estimate that's very accurate because

375
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
it's fairly broad

376
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
makes sense

377
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
so remember what we said about the five

378
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,959
ranges you notice that i took the top

379
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
value of each of these five ranges in my

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
calculation and that's just kind of a

381
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
rule of thumb of how you would proceed

382
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
so let's keep going

383
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,320
so we said that the monte carlo creates

384
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
a thousand simulations you can do less

385
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
than that if you generated a hundred

386
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
uh probabilities at a time you would

387
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
already know what the shape of that

388
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
probability looks like but if you

389
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
generate a thousand and you have much

390
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
more detail much more rich and in depth

391
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,600
right but you can do any number of those

392
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
we do a thousand

393
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
so this is another snippet of what one

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
of these looks like in this case my

395
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,959
minimum is 25

396
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,040
my maximum is 50 so it was a little more

397
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
than 20 range here but my most likely

398
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
was 45 so if you look at how the chart

399
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
is skewed you can see that the most

400
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,079
likely value that you pick in your

401
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,880
ranges skews the probability of the

402
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,079
chart

403
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
so when you have these three values it

404
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,240
doesn't always have to be in the middle

405
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
it can be skewed to the left skewed to

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
the right for whatever reasons

407
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,760
but you want to start thinking about

408
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
always doing this as the minimum most

409
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
likely

410
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,199
and the

411
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,120
and the maximum value so in the in the

412
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,680
example we used before

413
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,959
generally

414
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,720
when somebody asks you and you give a

415
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
value back like that you're talking

416
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
about the most likely but if you want to

417
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
represent the full range you would do

418
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,639
three calculations

419
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
one for each of those values and in this

420
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,680
way

421
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,760
you can use the probability joint um

422
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
the um

423
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,440
the

424
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
what

425
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
do you hate that when your brain just

426
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
skips a beat

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,040
but you can use that to approximate the

428
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,680
the monte carlo

429
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
so those are the methods and now that

430
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,279
we've talked a little bit about what's

431
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,880
under the hood let's go talk about the

432
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,279
miter attack model so i'm guessing most

433
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
people here have heard of miter attack

434
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
model and you've used this framework yes

435
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,480
show of hands

436
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,720
yeah that's why i thought um i put this

437
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,399
first slide up there you might not know

438
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,160
but a few days ago there was an update

439
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
to the mitre attack framework so i just

440
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
kind of put that up there

441
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
for awareness so those of you who

442
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
haven't used this and just to explain to

443
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,800
you how i use this in the model the

444
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,920
miter attack is this community driven de

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,320
facto standard of all this information

446
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
related to attack so i'm going to use

447
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,480
this as a resource to go do my research

448
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,440
from

449
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,279
and the areas i'm going to go look first

450
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,959
i'm going to go take a look at tactics

451
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,120
the tactics align with the life cycle of

452
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
the attack sequence and in my model i'm

453
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
going to lay out everything that i'm

454
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
analyzing by the attack sequence from

455
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,880
beginning to end so i'll probably go

456
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
look at tactics and decides which of

457
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
these i want to include in my model

458
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
and then i'm going to go look at some of

459
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
the techniques and i'll give you two

460
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,480
scenarios that i built together in this

461
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
and i lay out for you so i'm going to go

462
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
look at techniques i'm going to get some

463
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,480
information from that given the models

464
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
that i want to do today i'm also going

465
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
to take a look at some very specific

466
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,279
groups to kind of see the kinds of

467
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,000
things that these groups typically do

468
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
i'm also going to go look at software

469
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,120
one of the models i'm going to do for

470
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,959
you is a very specific piece of software

471
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,320
so i'm going to go look at that and see

472
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
okay who else uses this software so i'm

473
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
going to go do all this research and

474
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
kind of pull together the kinds of

475
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
things that i want to include in my

476
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
model so that i can answer the question

477
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
that leadership has asked what's the

478
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,000
likelihood that that will happen to us

479
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
so the first one we'll take a look at is

480
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,240
emoteet

481
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,959
so

482
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,560
on this chart i kind of lay out my

483
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,680
process

484
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,039
so i'm going to go to mitre and i'm

485
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,640
going to look at the groups who've used

486
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
this i'm trying to see what kind of

487
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,000
behavior how did they use this what did

488
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,439
they do with it what were the what are

489
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,480
the things that they were able to

490
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,919
accomplish i'm going to go look at the

491
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
software itself i'm going to go look at

492
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
the tactics that's going to be my life

493
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,119
cycle and then i'll go look at some of

494
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
the techniques and i'll pick and choose

495
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
the ones that i want to put into my

496
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,640
scenario does this make sense

497
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,119
as i'm doing this research i'm also

498
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
going to deconstruct the attack so i can

499
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,640
understand what was the sequence that

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
people used i'm also trying to identify

501
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,200
what are the vulnerabilities that they

502
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,720
leveraged in the attack because i'm

503
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
going to turn around and look at my own

504
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
data and say do i have any of these

505
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities like

506
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
this in my environment right

507
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
and then i'm also from this gonna pull

508
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
out what are some of the best practices

509
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,679
because the whole reason we do this is

510
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,400
to give ourselves time to plan a way to

511
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
mitigate and prevent this from happening

512
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
to us so i'm gonna i'm gonna look at

513
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
best practices and then i'm gonna start

514
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
developing what are mitigations what are

515
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
some things that we can do to stop the

516
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,760
cycle or to prevent it all together

517
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
so i'm also going to take a look at the

518
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,919
news and anything else that i can find

519
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,760
about this group

520
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,200
this came from cso online the the threat

521
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,280
group initially ta-542 from 2014 to 2019

522
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,679
emittet was their signature payload

523
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
they ran email campaigns primarily

524
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,559
against banks for fraud think trojan

525
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,080
right

526
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,160
they used to deliver it's also used to

527
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
deliver trick bot which has been

528
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
identified as a precursor to ransomware

529
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,520
so keep that in your mind some things

530
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
that you see happen are a precursor to

531
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
something else so if you want to predict

532
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
the likelihood of that end game look for

533
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
some of the precursor events

534
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
there was a multinational collaboration

535
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
and the initial group was shut down in

536
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
2021

537
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
but then

538
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,720
in april

539
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
just this year

540
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
this kind of activity was seen again and

541
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,760
so this is this goes back to that cso

542
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,200
online the link that i have at the

543
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,880
bottom they talk about that in this

544
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
article but now they're doing different

545
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
things with this they have new tactics

546
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
that they're using

547
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,120
so they use lower volume of email

548
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
instead of high volume they've

549
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
brought the volume down they use one

550
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
drive and they've transitioned from

551
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,799
macros to dlls there's some different

552
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,880
things they're doing here

553
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
and some people are saying that this is

554
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,039
in response to a microsoft announcement

555
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
that was put out but again you're

556
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,080
collecting research to build your

557
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
scenario

558
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,000
also in this article from proofpoint

559
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,240
they have this really interesting chart

560
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,679
and i want you to pay attention to this

561
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
chart so when emoted first started

562
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,840
um

563
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,559
being used so this is from 1917 to 2017

564
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,240
2019

565
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,679
i want you to take a look at the pattern

566
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,520
it starts off very low

567
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,960
and then there's more i'll call that

568
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
excitement

569
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
and then there are gaps in between

570
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,320
and then there's a lot of excitement it

571
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,159
comes back down it's very irregular we

572
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,520
don't see

573
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
behavior like this that is constant

574
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,559
either flat or always on a single curved

575
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,440
arc you have these jumps

576
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
and breaks in between

577
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
so when we get to the model at the end

578
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,720
of this

579
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,480
i want you to realize this is normal

580
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,159
behavior that we actually see because

581
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,600
this is the kind of thing that that

582
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
model predicts

583
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
so there's some more news related to

584
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
this particular

585
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
first scenario that i want to put

586
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,960
together

587
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
and

588
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
this one came from syste.gov

589
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,919
so another group wizard spider

590
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
had been known to use trickbot and then

591
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,159
they would put ransomware out and they

592
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,400
would use this against a wide range of

593
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
organizations so in my scenario i can

594
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
look at this and say maybe my scenario

595
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,679
is targeted against some of these

596
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,080
organizations corporations governments

597
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,799
or hospitals right so that gives me my

598
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,480
targets i might use

599
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
and there was also a recent announcement

600
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
that cyber crime groups

601
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,799
are pledging support

602
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,159
to russia

603
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,679
and they have threatened to conduct

604
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
cyber operations in retaliations for

605
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,159
those offenses against russia think

606
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,919
america right

607
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
so my scenario at the bottom of the

608
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
screen here is an emote phishing attack

609
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
with a malicious download link leading

610
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
to an installation of trickbot and a

611
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
ransomware or a wiper

612
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
and and now i'm going to show you the

613
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,760
second scenario and why i have oral

614
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,400
wiper in there right as i build out

615
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
these scenarios you'll notice that i'm

616
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
not digging deep deep deep into very

617
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,320
specific techniques that they're using

618
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,039
i'm generalizing and i'm generalizing

619
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,039
because if you were listening yesterday

620
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,720
to many of the speakers and today as

621
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,080
well many of them repeat the same thing

622
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
these people will very quickly

623
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,120
pivot from one payload to another

624
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
payload from one target to another

625
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
target so if you if you raise your

626
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
analysis up a level and you look at the

627
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
types of attacks and the type of

628
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,000
techniques then you will accomplish your

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
goal which is what's the likelihood for

630
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
my organization and what can i do to

631
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,159
protect myself against this not just one

632
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,480
technique but these kinds of attacks

633
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,880
make sense

634
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,200
so as i start pulling my data together

635
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
for this one i'm going to look at the

636
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,200
weaknesses in my own organization i'm

637
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
going to look at things like how are my

638
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
my systems hardened do i have weak

639
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
protocols in use what does my remote

640
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,200
access look like what am i using i

641
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
should be monitoring for indicators of

642
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,799
compromise i'm going to look at my

643
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,679
processes do i have an incident response

644
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,039
process for

645
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,360
a vulnerability to download malware is

646
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
that in my playbook do i really have

647
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
that maybe i need to go dust that off

648
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
take a look at it i'm also going to look

649
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,919
at the people

650
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
aspect of the process do i have people

651
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
who are working at home

652
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,159
and are they more vulnerable maybe for

653
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,480
phishing related emails that might say

654
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,880
hey corporate has an update security

655
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
patch coming your way right think about

656
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
these things as i put this scenario

657
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
together right

658
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,799
so now let's talk about how i would

659
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,400
start modeling attack number two and

660
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,799
then i'll take you to the analysis side

661
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
so for attack number two i want to pick

662
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
a group this time first one was software

663
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
this time it's a group apt-29 and i'm

664
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
going to pull out a wiper scenario

665
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
because this was in the news recently so

666
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
again this slide is like it was in my

667
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,200
attack

668
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
version number one i'm going to look at

669
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
groups software i'm going to miter

670
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
attack doing my research i'm going to

671
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,039
look at some of the tactics and

672
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,080
techniques

673
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
then i'm going to take a look at the

674
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,960
what was just in the news and i'll show

675
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
you that in a second i'm going to start

676
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,080
deconstructing that attack what did they

677
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
do what was the sequence what

678
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,080
vulnerabilities did they leverage what

679
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
best practices can i pull out from this

680
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
let me go look at my own vulnerabilities

681
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
what do i have that relates to this and

682
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,720
then how can i start developing

683
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
mitigations what can we start to do to

684
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,679
plan to avoid this if possible

685
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
so for apt-29

686
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
there is some history here

687
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,480
they've been

688
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
identified as associated with solar

689
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
winds that was a software update not

690
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
petcha which was a precursor to

691
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,919
solarwinds remember how we mentioned

692
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
that you can have precursors there's one

693
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,080
but that wasn't actually ransomware it

694
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,880
was fake and it was a wiper right

695
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,679
log4j that was an open source library

696
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,400
attack that's slightly different

697
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
indications of collaborations and

698
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
attacks against u.s banks those were

699
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
seen since the sanctions were levied

700
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
against russia remember how in the

701
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,279
previous

702
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,720
tax scenario i

703
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,880
made a note of the fact that oh yeah

704
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,320
some of the some of the people said you

705
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
know we're going to stand with russia

706
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
you know in retaliation they've done

707
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,039
that before you can expect they'll do it

708
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
again

709
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,400
and there were there were attacks on the

710
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279
ukraine electric grid think iot and

711
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,120
there were healthcare wipers that were

712
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,960
used so i've kind of got this

713
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,760
this group of of potentials to put into

714
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,840
my scenario

715
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,760
so as i'm doing my research hhhs.gov

716
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,640
put out this wonderful detailed

717
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
piece of um uh information on on all

718
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,080
tactic techniques it's great see if you

719
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,360
haven't taken a look at it go take a

720
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
look at it but what they highlighted

721
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,039
that i picked out just one of them was a

722
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,840
hermetic wiper so this is recent and it

723
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
occurred after a denial of service that

724
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
they did a denial of service first it

725
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
came with an executable and it leveraged

726
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,440
a legitimate happen to be chinese tool

727
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,279
with a digital signature which has now

728
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,120
been revoked well that's kind of

729
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,039
interesting what was interesting is that

730
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,279
they knew what was in the environment

731
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,440
and that was what they targeted so that

732
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,039
might make me think oh well what are

733
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,640
some of the known things i have in my

734
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
environment maybe i should focus on

735
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
those

736
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,360
it had multiple variants remember

737
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
they're gonna

738
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,520
retool and pivot very quickly one of the

739
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,919
things that it did it compromised tomcat

740
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,840
and it executed a powershell and then it

741
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
downloaded a jpeg which i thought was

742
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
really intriguing i wonder where they're

743
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,360
going to go with that

744
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,760
in another case they used smb week

745
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
protocol against exchange right so we

746
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
see that right we had that in the first

747
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
one so the scenario i might put together

748
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,679
for this one

749
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,840
is to consider a denial of service as a

750
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
red flag

751
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
then it's going to be followed up with

752
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,440
an update or a warning email that's sent

753
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
out

754
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
it's going to have a link to a download

755
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,440
executable hey we've got you know

756
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,720
something happening in the environment

757
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
we want you to update right and then

758
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
that executable would install

759
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,960
something to compromise and then the

760
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
wiper would follow after that

761
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
now as we put this together just as

762
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
research to develop a scenario what's

763
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
also kind of curious is that the fbi in

764
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,120
the last

765
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,559
i think it was at least the last two

766
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
months maybe six weeks

767
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,120
they had a forward-facing website that

768
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,400
was compromised

769
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
it was put under a denial of service

770
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
but nothing else happened

771
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,840
but

772
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,720
they the attackers sent out an email

773
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,600
and said oh hey this has happened

774
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,159
and people who got that believed it and

775
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,159
they fell into their incident response

776
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,919
programs

777
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
so the attack was very much like this

778
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
and it caused people to take an action

779
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,919
and i thought that was very interesting

780
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,440
it wasn't they were just going after

781
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
this website they wanted to see what you

782
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,799
were going to do

783
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,640
and i thought that was very telling so

784
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,400
you collect this information and then

785
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,799
you start looking at your own data

786
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,240
so in this case

787
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,520
i'm going to look at web facing

788
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,039
applications i'm going to look at

789
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
compromises you know

790
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
for dos denial of service i'm going to

791
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
look at you know what's my weaknesses in

792
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
the areas of lateral movement malicious

793
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,399
payload you know i'm going to take a

794
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,240
real good look at that again i'm going

795
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
to question my processes and i'm going

796
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,679
to question my people and take a look at

797
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,480
all these areas

798
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
now let's see how we're gonna quantify

799
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
this

800
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,480
so we're gonna have this screen up here

801
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,919
we're gonna go through this for a couple

802
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,840
of minutes because this is the analysis

803
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
so everything else was

804
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,600
what's the scenario i want to play out

805
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,919
what data do i want to go take a look at

806
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,480
and then now how do i do the analysis so

807
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
the first thing i'm looking at is

808
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,559
for my tax sequence on initial access

809
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
in other words who clicked who got the

810
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
email and clicked that's my remember we

811
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,080
said that's my initial access so i know

812
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
that the industry best practice the best

813
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,240
that you could expect your organization

814
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,080
organization to get if you're actively

815
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
training on you know people not clicking

816
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
on the link for phishing is about five

817
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
percent so maybe my organized

818
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,000
organization is really not quite that

819
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,640
good but they're not bad so maybe 12

820
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
maybe i've got some statistics in house

821
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
maybe i've done this kind of training so

822
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
maybe i have some data that i can use

823
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
that percent to pull in

824
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
on the second line i'm looking at

825
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,600
execution so on this count maybe i don't

826
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,279
have a lot of data available but

827
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,520
remember we said we can create ranges

828
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
and we can do that math very easily so

829
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
if i talk to operations they go well

830
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,080
that's very low we're very good that's a

831
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,279
very low

832
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,760
and i'm going to consider my likelihood

833
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,840
if a threat actor gained access the

834
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,279
likelihood that they would leverage it

835
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
against me is high so i'm going to stay

836
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
on 80 for all of these right so i've

837
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
also defined kind of by that who my

838
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,480
threat actor is and and how capable they

839
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
are right so

840
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,840
and then if we take this from the

841
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
example before

842
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
point eight times point two is point

843
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
sixteen so i have a 16 percent risk in

844
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
this area

845
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,120
does this make sense so far are you

846
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
following along with me yes i see heads

847
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,960
not excellent

848
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,559
so now let's look at the next one which

849
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
is persistent

850
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,240
what is the likelihood what are the

851
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
vulnerabilities i have that once they're

852
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
on one system they can move laterally

853
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
and or become persistent on that system

854
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
so maybe in this case i think that my

855
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,679
security here my systems and

856
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,159
configuration is not very good maybe

857
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,440
it's medium

858
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,760
right maybe it's medium maybe i don't

859
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,679
have all my systems locked down exactly

860
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,279
the same i've got some that have some

861
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,440
variations some some differences right

862
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
which kind of describes most

863
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,679
organizations right

864
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,480
so in that case i'm going to use a 0.60

865
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
for that range and i'm going to use my

866
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
0.80 and i'm going to come up with a 48

867
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
risk in this area

868
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
and i continue doing this same process

869
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,960
all the way down and so my attack

870
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,120
sequence i got that from the tactics of

871
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,039
mitre and i picked and choose which ones

872
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,720
of those i wanted to to do which is

873
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
nearly all of them

874
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
but this is the process that you follow

875
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,840
so for each of these

876
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
i could easily say talking to operations

877
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,159
without having to do a massive data pull

878
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,440
without having to do a heavy stop and go

879
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
pull data

880
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
just a quick conversation build up those

881
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
relationships you know what do you think

882
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,120
it's like or if you have assessments in

883
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
your organization that's another great

884
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
resource to go pull the assessments that

885
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,880
have been done they'll identify all

886
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
these kinds of weaknesses

887
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,640
if you're looking at the weaknesses

888
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,279
within your vulnerability data

889
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,240
having some way to interpret and dig

890
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
into that data is very helpful one of

891
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
the things i like to do and something

892
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,960
that's in the prmod framework is a

893
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,880
spreadsheet that allows you to drop your

894
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
vulnerability data in and it will

895
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,760
rapidly pull out by texturing

896
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
things like admin privileges

897
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
access weaknesses protocol weaknesses so

898
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,559
i can quickly tag my data and generate

899
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,840
for myself some sort of

900
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,880
percentage that i can use in my

901
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
calculations and once you have that it

902
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
doesn't take very long to you know to

903
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,039
wash and repeat that process

904
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,399
so is this part

905
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,320
making sense do we i'm going to want to

906
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,159
stop here for just a few minutes does

907
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,000
anybody have questions on this part of

908
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it how we got to this

909
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,399
how we built up the scenarios how we

910
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
looked at our data because that's the

911
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,720
heavy lift before the actual assessment

912
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
the math is easy right and that's easy

913
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,919
but it's this other work before that so

914
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,760
do we have any questions here before i

915
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,158
go on

916
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,640
i'm sorry you're gonna have to speak up

917
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,799
for

918
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,200
yeah me called probabilistic risk

919
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
modeling for cyber so in our industry

920
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,600
cyber there are really basically two

921
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,720
frameworks

922
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,039
pr mod for cyber and fair i don't know

923
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,200
if you've heard of fair fair uses

924
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,399
never heard it okay fair is an

925
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,959
international

926
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
and online website you can get all the

927
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,559
information on that awesome austin yes

928
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,600
you're welcome

929
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
so the story of prmod the story behind

930
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,799
both of them uh fair was created by jack

931
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,360
jones he was a ciso at the time and his

932
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,919
board said you know he wanted to

933
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,440
make a purchase

934
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,279
i don't remember what the equipment was

935
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,279
but he wanted to purchase some equipment

936
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,640
and he took it to the board and he said

937
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,080
we need this and the board said that's

938
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,320
great but if i if you spend this money

939
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
how much is that going to reduce your

940
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,880
risk

941
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
and you couldn't answer the question who

942
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,679
could

943
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,279
so he went out and created

944
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,320
quantification for risk cyber risk which

945
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,039
was the precursor to the standard fare

946
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
and it uses the monte carlo simulation

947
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,919
method remember i told you i have two

948
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,760
three methods so that's the method that

949
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,159
it uses that's how the story behind it

950
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
where how it was created and it looks at

951
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,399
a financial impact because that was what

952
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,080
he needed right he needed to justify the

953
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,120
board so this came from work that i have

954
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,840
done with clients because

955
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,919
um we needed to i needed to answer many

956
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,679
other questions that were not related to

957
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,519
finance i needed to answer questions

958
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,000
about the probability of being attacked

959
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,480
from my perimeter strength analyzing my

960
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,240
system level strength supply chain risk

961
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
process risk

962
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
cyber attack risk

963
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,480
all of these other questions long before

964
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,159
you get to the question of what would

965
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,240
that cost right

966
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
so

967
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,919
there were not a lot of tools out there

968
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,360
you could either

969
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,039
program it in a different language which

970
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,720
i didn't want to do you could use the

971
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,240
scientific tool which i didn't want to

972
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,360
do because it's not written in the

973
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,120
language of cyber and that would be

974
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,799
complicated to me so i thought the

975
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,399
easier thing would be just go build it

976
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,120
which is what i did and it's an excel

977
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,199
spreadsheet that runs on

978
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
your laptop because in the last five

979
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,159
years the libraries in excel can now do

980
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,399
the math and there's are there are tools

981
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,560
that now allow you to actually build

982
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
these kinds of probabilistic models on

983
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
the platform so prior to three or four

984
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,399
years ago you couldn't even have built

985
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,760
this and it wouldn't have run on your

986
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
laptop you would have had to have done

987
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,480
it some other way

988
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,239
and so that's why there are not a lot of

989
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,800
these kinds of models out there

990
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,320
so before we leave this any other

991
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,599
questions

992
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,560
no okay so the last comment i'll make on

993
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,440
this when you're doing this kind of work

994
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,839
um you can use historical data to build

995
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,918
up percentages right

996
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,000
um you can use the one through five

997
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,918
qualitative the quantitative scale to

998
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,000
start giving you a range

999
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,280
right you can use the joint probability

1000
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
understanding that you're giving one

1001
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
value out of that range which is usually

1002
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,800
your most likely

1003
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,599
right

1004
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,599
and then as i said at the very bottom i

1005
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,000
encourage you to generalize to look for

1006
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,560
types of attacks so that your analysis

1007
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
has a broader applicability to the

1008
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,880
organization

1009
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,880
okay so if there are no other questions

1010
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
on that let me show you what the

1011
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,040
charting

1012
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,359
of this looks like at the end so because

1013
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,680
this is in excel i can just take those

1014
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
two columns of numbers pull them into

1015
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,119
another spreadsheet and i can generate

1016
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,040
any kind of charts i want bar charts so

1017
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
now i have something i can take to

1018
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,079
leadership so they can understand and

1019
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,839
say this is

1020
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,480
the risk that our organization has from

1021
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
these kinds of attacks

1022
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,920
that we can look long-term to how we now

1023
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,880
might generate mitigation plans to avoid

1024
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,599
this and you'll have recommendations in

1025
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
every area what can i do for initial

1026
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920
access what can i do about execution

1027
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,760
what can i do about lateral movement

1028
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
you'll have now recommendations best

1029
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,920
practices and strategies across the

1030
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,599
entire landscape of the attack

1031
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,400
so now yes

1032
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
correct so so this is an ex

1033
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,480
yeah so it's an excel generated thing so

1034
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,839
what i did

1035
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,839
is i

1036
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,400
took

1037
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
my probability column

1038
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
i took those numbers

1039
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,079
and i took this column

1040
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,320
which has my categories that's all i did

1041
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,440
and i let excel auto-generate

1042
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,200
they're looked at independently

1043
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,040
we calculated the probability of these

1044
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,320
independently

1045
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,200
now in the framework i do give you what

1046
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,320
i call a helper so that if you wanted to

1047
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,200
weight

1048
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,079
these

1049
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,000
then you would have something that is

1050
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
related more to what you're speaking

1051
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,480
about so that if if this likelihood is

1052
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,560
very low then that should change the

1053
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,720
scale for all of the others

1054
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,440
but i didn't put it in this example

1055
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
yes

1056
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,839
yes

1057
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,000
but the other thing i would just say is

1058
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,520
you know if you had something as small

1059
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,920
as five percent in many cases all it

1060
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,839
takes is one click that really could be

1061
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,040
a barn door

1062
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
it looks like a small barn door but it's

1063
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,720
still a barn door

1064
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
okay so now let's let's talk about some

1065
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
some long range forecasts this is the

1066
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
new model that i was very excited to

1067
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
bring to you

1068
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,079
so when i was looking at putting this

1069
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,560
together log4j was something that had

1070
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,119
just hit the news and then

1071
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,040
just like in the last couple of days

1072
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,359
there was this new bit of news that came

1073
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,560
out about a different kind of library

1074
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,079
this npr mp npm package

1075
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,079
and that it was now not just being

1076
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,560
downloaded as people downloaded it but

1077
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,040
it was being made a dependency and being

1078
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,079
pushed

1079
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,640
so like log 4j is the same kind of

1080
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
attack but the technique is very

1081
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,720
different why because they want it to

1082
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,520
get out there rapidly right so if i were

1083
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,599
looking at this kind of attack and just

1084
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,200
saying well what's the what if long

1085
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,440
range how could i predict that so this

1086
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
is what this model does

1087
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,000
in 1970 there was some fairly new math

1088
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,200
that came out

1089
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,359
and this was called a hawks process what

1090
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,320
the hawks process says is one event

1091
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,160
increases the likelihood of another

1092
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,200
event

1093
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
there have been white papers published

1094
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,320
um on on on these hawks itself that

1095
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,960
process has now been widely adopted in

1096
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,760
epidemiology seismology finance a number

1097
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,480
of places because it begins to give us

1098
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,320
this way to map and to predict

1099
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
events occurring

1100
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
as we saw in that chart

1101
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
that they're not just a mathematical

1102
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
model that has a rate and a speed and it

1103
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,560
kind of gives you you know it's accurate

1104
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,320
but but that's not really how events

1105
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,359
occur

1106
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,520
they occur in these clumps and there's

1107
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,359
you know delays in between and they're

1108
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,599
very different hawks laid the foundation

1109
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,880
for that concept in 1970.

1110
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,119
in 2021 andrew dawe theorized

1111
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
another kind of counting process that

1112
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,960
now lets you not only say yes one event

1113
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,720
increases the likelihood of another eve

1114
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,359
event but how long does that effect

1115
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,359
remain in duration

1116
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,359
and if you can mathematically calculate

1117
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,200
this you can get very close to

1118
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,680
predicting when the event will occur

1119
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
that's very new we've not been able to

1120
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,599
do that before this is very exciting so

1121
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,599
dawes math was theorized and published

1122
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,440
last year there at least two there are a

1123
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
couple of papers but there are at least

1124
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,119
two that have used this math one was for

1125
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,720
department of defense and they said if

1126
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,359
somebody had an ied what's the time

1127
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,440
period that others might be emboldened

1128
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,839
to do this again so you can see the the

1129
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,920
real life impact of what this would do

1130
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,280
another paper looked at teenage suicides

1131
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,520
these occur in clumps so if i have one

1132
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,920
suicide am i at the beginning of a clump

1133
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,760
what do i think that scale might look

1134
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,000
like can i do anything how would i now

1135
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
react to this community

1136
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,400
right so what we did in in 2022 just

1137
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
this last quarter

1138
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,560
we took the math and we implemented it

1139
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,160
in a model and i want to show you what

1140
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,640
it looks like

1141
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,119
so as i looked at applying this new math

1142
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,359
i wanted to look at cyber attacks

1143
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,119
because that's what i do

1144
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,800
what the model is modeling is the

1145
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,440
underlying human behavior

1146
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,599
that is impacted

1147
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,400
and i also wanted to look at risk

1148
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,920
so if i'm looking at what's happening in

1149
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,319
the news today and i see these things

1150
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,040
happening across the world what's that

1151
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
risk to me what's the risk to my

1152
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,920
organization because i'm trying to

1153
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,240
protect my organizations and i said i

1154
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,680
want to look at the indicators of

1155
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
prevalence and so i want to ask a few

1156
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,400
questions is it being actively exploited

1157
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,880
is it in my geographic area yes no is it

1158
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,119
on my platform yes no is it in my

1159
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,760
industry yes no do i have a third party

1160
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,359
that's impacted you can see each of

1161
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,280
these questions begins to give you a

1162
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,119
feel for who the threat actor might be

1163
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,119
and what their motivation might be as

1164
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,520
well as the path of it coming to me

1165
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
and the idea is that if i can forecast

1166
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,560
this far enough out i can start to

1167
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,000
develop mitigations and in the framework

1168
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,319
if it is below 40

1169
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,160
you're monitoring it and beginning to

1170
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,119
develop mitigations once it's over 60

1171
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,440
implement does that make sense trying to

1172
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
give you a gateway to look at something

1173
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,280
long term update in real time

1174
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,520
to prepare so this is what the input

1175
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,560
looks like

1176
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,079
and in this i'm going to compare two

1177
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,280
sets

1178
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,560
2 000 events and 8 000 events

1179
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,880
in a 10-day time period

1180
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,079
um

1181
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,480
so the one we have in front is the 8000

1182
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,760
and you'll see the indicators of

1183
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,920
prevalence right now it's being actively

1184
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
exploited it's not in my industry it's

1185
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,200
not my geographic right everything else

1186
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,760
is no so that's the input and this is

1187
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
what the output looks like

1188
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,240
this name g7 and nth gsep these are the

1189
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,359
two counting processes that daw created

1190
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,520
that never existed before before we had

1191
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
counting processes so when we say

1192
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,079
counting processes think time cueing

1193
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,359
processes think uh real time delivery in

1194
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,040
supply chain how do i know what do i

1195
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,280
need to calculate because i'm doing this

1196
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,800
kind of math of queuing i know what

1197
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
comes in i know what goes out and i know

1198
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
what that looks like so we have things

1199
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,280
like poisson's exponentials and gamma

1200
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,680
probability distributions right we

1201
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,119
talked about the monte carlo and the

1202
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,040
output of that so those are counting

1203
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,680
processes these are counting processes

1204
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,920
that show that self-excitement when one

1205
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,240
event occurs another one occurs that

1206
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,079
increases the likelihood it increases

1207
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,079
the likelihood again so the chart we're

1208
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,599
going to see the growth pattern at the

1209
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,440
end that i'll show you is substantially

1210
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,119
different

1211
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,280
the chart on the left top is normal

1212
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,200
probability distribution

1213
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,440
any probability matrix can give you this

1214
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,839
the one on the left is the cumulative

1215
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,440
and any of them can give you that what

1216
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,119
sits in the middle

1217
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,760
is the probability of a jump

1218
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
that self excitement when is it going to

1219
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,079
occur and how big is it going to occur

1220
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,480
and it's charted over time in this case

1221
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,880
it's charted over 100 time period

1222
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,119
whatever your whatever your time period

1223
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,040
is you're looking at could be hours days

1224
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,839
weeks so when we i did this initial

1225
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,640
example i said over 10 days so

1226
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,400
i've got it the 10 days to spread out

1227
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,640
over 100 time periods does that make

1228
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
sense

1229
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
the chart on the bottom is the same

1230
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,160
probability just in a different chart so

1231
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,839
you can see how it looks over

1232
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,520
time now what if i want to compare these

1233
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,760
two because different counting processes

1234
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,240
behave in different ways a poisson is a

1235
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,839
standard rate

1236
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,319
but nothing occurs evenly all the time

1237
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,319
like that not in human behavior and

1238
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,599
other behavior right a um

1239
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,400
an exponential is a growth pattern a

1240
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,079
gamma tells you when the first event

1241
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,599
will occur so all these underlying

1242
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,760
counting process behave differently so

1243
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,520
if i want to generate

1244
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
the self-excitement based on these

1245
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,440
counting processes i also want to

1246
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
compare what they look like compared to

1247
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,400
each other

1248
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,520
this shows you in the first snapshot of

1249
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,880
2000

1250
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,119
events in 10 days what that looked like

1251
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,960
you see how small that is in the bottom

1252
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,720
corner of that chart

1253
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,480
so to normalize

1254
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,280
the the access and then compare the self

1255
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,680
excitement when you have 8 000 the next

1256
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
day occurring you can see that it

1257
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,720
doesn't just quadruple it is

1258
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,040
substantially more each event increases

1259
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,920
the likelihood of more events so the way

1260
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,079
you would use a model like this is when

1261
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,160
it begins you would start

1262
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,400
charting then and you would continue to

1263
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,640
chart it this way over time and then you

1264
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,160
would also be able to understand what

1265
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,800
the risk is relative to you and what

1266
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
those events might look like when they

1267
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,200
might occur in that time pattern does

1268
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,919
that make sense

1269
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,319
so

1270
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,720
the two models i've shown you here the

1271
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,880
first is the pr mod for cyber framework

1272
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,480
and the second one is the mark talks

1273
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,400
process with indicators of prevalence

1274
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,359
for cyber both of those are mine

1275
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,040
in the probabilistic risk modeling

1276
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
framework it's a spreadsheet with

1277
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,319
multiple models in them it includes

1278
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,160
everything that fair has you could do a

1279
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,680
full affair process in this if you

1280
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,359
wanted it gives you the methods

1281
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,359
independently so i could use the methods

1282
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,440
combine them however i wanted to do it

1283
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
in my analysis and it also gives you

1284
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,240
models that are pre-formed like supply

1285
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,160
chain compliance and industry attack

1286
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,520
which we look like tabletop exercises

1287
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,240
and and other things processes i'll give

1288
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,599
you here's a good one

1289
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,280
if you want to find a way to rapidly

1290
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,040
reduce your risk take a real good look

1291
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
at your processes if you have processes

1292
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,119
that are inconsistently applied you have

1293
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,280
risk if you can make them consistently

1294
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,880
applied you might be able to move that

1295
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,520
risk from high to very low

1296
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,280
that's almost forty to sixty percent

1297
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,800
reduction of risk

1298
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,640
nobody thinks to look at your processes

1299
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,880
take a look at them

1300
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
so here is um the link that i'll give

1301
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
you and if you

1302
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,599
uh we'll distribute the slide deck but

1303
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,440
if you if you don't have that or for

1304
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,599
whatever reason you can also just reach

1305
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,760
out to me but on the link you'll be able

1306
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,599
to download a copy of the model that we

1307
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,760
worked with today for free for the

1308
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,240
attack model

1309
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,319
and there's my contact information and

1310
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,079
that's all that i have do we have any

1311
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,079
questions

1312
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,160
so this is brand new

1313
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,319
we built it first we went through daws

1314
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
math and and did what we needed to do to

1315
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,280
take it from the beautiful math that it

1316
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,720
is into something that could be

1317
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,079
implemented

1318
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,440
in a spreadsheet

1319
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,000
and in the model that i wanted

1320
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,800
so that's being peer reviewed

1321
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
and so no it has not been implemented

1322
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,400
but in the paper that had to be

1323
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,880
submitted there were eight

1324
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,720
evaluations that i went through

1325
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,640
documenting and in that process is kind

1326
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,040
of like writing a thesis

1327
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,520
so in order to write the white paper i

1328
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,920
used historical data sets that are well

1329
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
known and have been used before for

1330
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
modeling these kinds of things improving

1331
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,839
these kinds of things i used an online

1332
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,400
system that tracks threats and i pull

1333
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,720
that data from a snapshot and i use that

1334
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,000
i pulled

1335
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,200
historical reports for worm activity and

1336
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,000
how they grew so i took there were eight

1337
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,839
that i went through and then explaining

1338
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,839
the charts and in order to also have

1339
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,920
this justified you also have to show

1340
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,079
that the model acts predictively and

1341
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,319
that it doesn't get something calculate

1342
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,680
it and give you something that's highly

1343
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,079
improbable of happening and so within

1344
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,599
the model and within the math you have

1345
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,319
to kind of put rails on what you can do

1346
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,559
and so there are limits limiting factors

1347
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,800
that are in the math and dog use the

1348
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,040
same sort of thing so that's where this

1349
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,319
model sticks

1350
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,079
sits right now so it has not been

1351
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,400
implemented um

1352
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,000
but i'm very excited about it and i just

1353
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
wanted to share because i thought it was

1354
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,040
really cool

1355
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,720
i thought it was very cool

1356
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,000
um but that's that's where it sets and

1357
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,480
and it's being patented

1358
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,040
so so it's got the historical to it but

1359
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,319
we haven't implemented it yet but i

1360
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,480
would love if somebody wanted

1361
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,240
to do that work

1362
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,480
reach out and talk to me do i have any

1363
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,640
other questions yes ma'am um

1364
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,200
is your friend accessible

1365
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,599
yes if you go on my linkedin you will

1366
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,359
get the public

1367
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
simplified version that doesn't have all

1368
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,280
the heavy mac the one that has to go

1369
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,440
through you has to have all the math

1370
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,200
right yeah

1371
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,280
is there an ability to get to the heavy

1372
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,200
map oh just hit me up on linkedin and

1373
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,119
when you go to the top of my profile

1374
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,800
scroll through what's pinned at the top

1375
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
and you'll find it right there

1376
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,680
you're welcome any other questions

1377
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,440
yes sir have you thought

1378
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,040
that your mom was a natural enterprise

1379
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,559
i'm sorry you're going to have to speak

1380
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,160
up for me i'm part of hearing that no

1381
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,160
worries

1382
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,359
so i am marketing it

1383
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,960
and this is one of the ways that i do

1384
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,079
that

1385
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,880
i purposely didn't want to do what we

1386
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,480
think of as an enterprise model that's

1387
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,000
in the cloud i don't want you to put

1388
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,240
your vulnerability data in a cloud and i

1389
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,880
don't want to put it in a cloud so i

1390
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,720
purposely wanted something that had no

1391
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,760
macros no vba it's on a laptop it's an

1392
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
excel you can put it into any

1393
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,359
environment so you're responsible for

1394
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,960
your data i just show you how to do the

1395
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,040
analysis does that make sense

1396
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,119
but yes this could be used small

1397
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,520
business government environment

1398
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,000
enterprise where you use it across and

1399
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that goes back to and i know this is

1400
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,440
sounding kind of self-serving but the

1401
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,119
reason i wrote the book

1402
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,400
is because

1403
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,000
this kind of analysis a lot of people

1404
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,240
think of this like it's compliance one

1405
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,839
and done it is a heavy lift because

1406
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,440
that's what you see happening in the

1407
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,359
industry and i think it shouldn't have

1408
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,200
to be that way i think this should be

1409
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
something that anybody can ask and

1410
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,359
answer a question at any point whether

1411
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,079
it's operations an admin a business

1412
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,559
level manager wants to know

1413
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,920
something about

1414
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,200
what's the likelihood that something

1415
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
could happen that would impact my

1416
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,559
operations and put me out for four hours

1417
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,119
you should be able to ask and answer a

1418
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,319
question like that within your

1419
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,119
organization in a quantified manner and

1420
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,800
this is not what the this is not how

1421
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,240
we're doing it now and that's something

1422
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,319
that i want to change

1423
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,040
so i wanted it to be fast easy

1424
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,760
accessible that anybody can use written

1425
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,000
in the language of cyber all you have to

1426
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,480
do is look at your data develop the

1427
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,319
parameters for what you think your

1428
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,280
forecast is and then over time check

1429
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,359
your forecast and so here's how you do

1430
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,200
that whenever you create a forecast you

1431
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
create an estimate along with that and

1432
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,800
you see this in project management

1433
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,000
anybody involved in project management

1434
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
they have a variation it's called a pert

1435
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
model which is

1436
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
the most likely is just weighted more

1437
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,640
heavily other industries do this we just

1438
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,160
haven't been doing it

1439
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,079
and so i wanted people that to have a

1440
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,319
way to be able to do this so that as

1441
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,400
things occur you can easily go back in

1442
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,000
and update it you can always know if

1443
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,559
your model is valid if you are within

1444
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,119
that five to ten percent range that when

1445
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,040
you create your estimate you so i think

1446
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,200
this is my estimate plus or minus five

1447
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,040
percent as long as you're within the

1448
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,079
five or ten percent your model is solid

1449
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,400
when it skews out of that go back and

1450
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,760
update your data

1451
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,480
the model is calculating correct data

1452
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,520
has changed right makes sense

1453
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,400
any other questions

1454
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,960
yes no

1455
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,720
sorry no you're fine i'm watching the

1456
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,160
clock over here

1457
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,440
what about it

1458
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,960
like

1459
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,599
no

1460
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,720
that would be an interesting and lengthy

1461
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,440
detailed project

1462
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,839
i wouldn't discourage that work i think

1463
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,319
there's value in doing that work

1464
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,200
i would caution

1465
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,240
now i i've been in this industry for 30

1466
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,680
some odd years

1467
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,359
and i've done just about everything in

1468
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,440
the industry from building appliances

1469
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,440
from scratch protocol analysis dna i've

1470
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,359
done all this stuff right

1471
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,599
and i know that we have a tendency to

1472
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,880
want to dive deep into the details

1473
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,599
this type of analysis has more value if

1474
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,240
it's lifted a little higher up as i said

1475
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,079
before and you're looking at kinds of

1476
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,920
things with similarities you will have a

1477
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,720
broader reach that way than if you tend

1478
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,800
to dive really really deep

1479
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
but i don't discount the value of doing

1480
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,240
that

1481
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,000
i think we all want something that's a

1482
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,079
push button solution

1483
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,920
this kind of work isn't designed to be a

1484
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,800
push button it's designed to be a

1485
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,440
an intellectual thought process

1486
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,079
to help leadership make decisions

1487
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,280
remember that's why i said don't

1488
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,520
underestimate the value of an initial

1489
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,839
estimate there's tremendous value there

1490
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,520
and that's really kind of who this is

1491
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,680
speaking to and who you're doing it for

1492
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,040
right so you would put something like

1493
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,480
this together so that they could help

1494
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,800
make a decision and justify what you

1495
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,200
need that makes sense because now you've

1496
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,119
evidenced it and you've done it in a way

1497
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,520
that is repeatable and defensible and in

1498
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,760
the language that management understands

1499
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,000
and to this you would tie whatever the

1500
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,359
impact is whether that's an outage

1501
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,480
financial loss of reputation whatever

1502
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,960
the impact is in english to you you

1503
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,640
would tie that to this piece of the

1504
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,760
analysis that makes sense

1505
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,839
any other

1506
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:13,200
questions six minutes if not

1507
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,200
thank you and i hope you got something

1508
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,920
useful out

1509
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,989
