1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,598
foreign

2
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,240
hey welcome uh so uh I'm Craig Bowser

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,820
and this is uh Lou we're here to talk to

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,320
you about security engineers and

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,360
security engineering

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,980
so standard disclaimer uh the opinions

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,280
are most likely ours but definitely

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
nobody else's

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,620
so I am Craig Bowser I have been doing

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,760
security for over 20 years uh and I have

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,559
a bunch of letters that I have earned or

12
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,359
paid for I've worked in the DC area in

13
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,180
government and Consulting Contracting

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,880
type of environments uh married got kids

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,799
boys which means I have a full house and

16
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,100
no food in the fridge

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,740
and so that's me

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,259
that's your turn I know I was waiting

19
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,420
for you to do the slide thing oh no oh

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,420
okay because you know my pictures might

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,100
be a little bit more cuter than well it

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,080
is your kids are younger uh good

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,119
afternoon my name is Luke mcgoon I go by

24
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,420
Lou uh I do have a Twitter handle known

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,640
as infiltrate I was lucky to grab that

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,579
one with the league speak uh I've been

27
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,000
in cyber security for about 10 years but

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,060
in it in total about going on 25 years

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,460
I've been primarily in defense

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,060
contractor industry uh we recently moved

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,000
over to uh security Consulting with a

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
known so-called uh security consultant

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
vendor uh I do have some letters behind

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,299
my name and uh I've I'm really excited

35
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,619
to come and talk to you guys about

36
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,420
security Engineers because you know I

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,320
don't

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,399
you know

39
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,899
raise your hand when was the last time

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,160
you had somebody talk to you about

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
security engineering

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,599
I don't see any hands maybe one all

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,319
right so

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,520
we're going to talk about security

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,920
engineering we're going to give you some

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,840
you know some Frameworks in fact we're

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,980
going to give you another framework

48
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,739
because we love Frameworks we have the

49
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,340
the nist framework we have

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,239
yeah so we're going to give you another

51
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,220
one because you know you can't have

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,319
enough framework exactly talk about the

53
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,840
cyber security job market as it applies

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
to the security Engineers a little bit

55
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
about education about uh you know what

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,200
it how to become one how to get there

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
and give you some some of the current

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,459
challenges going forward in the Outlook

59
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,280
of what security engineering is like

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,099
so let's start off with a little bit of

61
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,500
Baseline let's kind of Define what a

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,239
security engineer security security

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,700
engineering does what yeah security

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,379
engineering does anybody know what

65
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,620
security engineering does anyone do pure

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
security Engineering in here they

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,099
consider themselves an a security

68
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,220
engineer anyone well I mean I do but I

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,599
swear to you this is not one of those

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,400
drug farmer and sales pitches or

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,519
whatever but anyway security engineering

72
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,580
is the Art and Science of

73
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,620
designing security controls into your

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,180
organization into your infrastructure

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,440
and things like that that is what

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
security engineering is in a nutshell

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,959
that's true so a security engineer is

78
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,000
someone who does those things but does

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,840
those things with the added context of

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,099
doing it in uh interactively or

81
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,959
interoperability interoperating with

82
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,480
operations and business making sure that

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,400
those two those two parts of the of the

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,620
work environment continue to function

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,739
so we're classically you know there's

86
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,360
been this whole thing you know when your

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,580
mama asked you what do you do and you

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,280
tell her I'm in I.T you know that's what

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,159
that was used to be and you know so so

90
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,379
nowadays we can now say we're in

91
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,239
security engineers and that's why right

92
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,060
we're we're doing this so let's talk a

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,798
little bit about the history of where

94
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,079
you know security security engineering

95
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,360
came from and why it tends to you know

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,620
why we think it really needs to be

97
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,500
viewed separately all right many of you

98
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,180
on you know been around a while you know

99
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,380
some of the history of this but we're

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,820
gonna you know do this about five

101
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,759
seconds right or maybe 25 seconds but

102
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,620
yeah

103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,500
yeah so if you look at technology you

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,800
look at uh where we where we've been to

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,320
the night uh early 1990s at the

106
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
beginning of the internet if you look at

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,120
where we are today with web and Cloud

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,540
you you can see uh with this slide that

109
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,820
the progression of Technology the

110
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,560
progression of everything accessing

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
technology also progress the threats and

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
vulnerabilities and things that are

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
happening in the in this world today and

114
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,259
that really is the Nexus of how our our

115
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,259
cyber security industry really kind of

116
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,020
uh formed and and

117
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,539
um and morphed into what it is where we

118
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,220
have all these Specialties penetration

119
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,340
testing uh uh compliance you know we

120
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,360
just had a guy in here talking about

121
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,060
compliance and and uh and the software

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,100
developers web security and all those

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,120
other things and now we're going

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
reaching out into other things such as

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,199
drones such as ICS even going up into

126
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,820
space so most of this represents uh that

127
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,460
transition of Technologies as as we go

128
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,280
uh based over the last 30 years and I

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,139
think what we want you guys to take away

130
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,440
from the slide is the increase in the

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,900
number of things that we in security

132
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,419
have to be aware of and are responsible

133
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,840
for right as Lou said back in the 90s it

134
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
was you know very simple uh relatively

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,660
in the sense that you had maybe some a

136
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,819
couple viruses some worms running around

137
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,819
you had your very simple websites and

138
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:12,360
emails uh you know whereas today the you

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,220
know some all those things are still

140
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,380
around but you've added all of these

141
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,960
Technologies such as you already

142
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,780
mentioned and so now all of those things

143
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,000
still have to work together I remember

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
when I was in the early 90s I'm in the

145
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,600
Air Force and I'm doing Opera uh um what

146
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,919
do we call it interoperability

147
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,440
interoperability of doing

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,800
um making things efficient and making

149
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,139
working on doing going to Air Force

150
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,660
bases and we're doing troubleshooting

151
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,060
and optimization at different bases and

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,060
going into a base in its windows nt4 I

153
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,099
mean some of you guys have no idea that

154
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,180
Windows had an NT version but you know

155
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,039
it that's what you know we're we're

156
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,199
looking at their configuration and

157
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,419
making it work better but we're adding

158
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,099
Security in so security is sort of just

159
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,500
sort of part of your job now you have as

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,380
he said all these uh specializations I

161
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,759
was talking to a friend just earlier

162
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,160
today and he says you know there are now

163
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,699
up to I think 45 individual definitions

164
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,020
of cyber cyber security jobs uh you know

165
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,660
that that you can go into

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,360
including cyber security and fishing

167
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,840
expert right not not the not not not you

168
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,580
know catch a fish but catch a person

169
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,400
guys so how do we how does how does

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
security engineering how does a career

171
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,500
path uh flow this is from cyber seek

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,139
this this website's pretty uh pretty

173
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,940
interactive as far as just being able to

174
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,300
kind of show your progression of tech of

175
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,720
of of a career I think the one thing I

176
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,220
really want to say from this slide is

177
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,280
that cyber security engineering is not

178
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,800
an entry-level job it's not designed to

179
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,139
be and we'll talk about more why that is

180
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,199
the case but you can see that you can go

181
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,840
from where you start off on the on the

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,120
left as a you know so the beginner rules

183
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,639
so these entry-level positions you hear

184
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,740
talked about of traditional the I.T

185
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,840
support server Administration Network

186
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,960
Administration uh you know these give

187
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,500
you that Foundation of understanding the

188
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
environment the Enterprise the

189
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,599
networking and then roll from there into

190
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,660
a more advanced positions such as cyber

191
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,199
security Specialists incident response

192
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,120
you know you can we can quibble over

193
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
where these fall into the career path

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,620
but the point being that you move from

195
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,799
there into perhaps more consultant

196
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,860
penetration testing but once you have

197
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,500
some all these sort of tasks under your

198
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,120
belt it gives you that uh contextual

199
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,920
view of the environment that you can

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,680
then really get into an architect or an

201
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,839
engineer role with the roles that you

202
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,540
need to understand all these previous

203
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,600
tasks all these previous

204
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,220
careers and previous views of the

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,160
network to really apply and don't worry

206
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,660
about the some of those numbers right

207
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,640
there below which are have some what

208
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
remaining consistence we'll dive more

209
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,720
into salaries later in the in the slide

210
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,160
deck

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,279
so where are some of these skills what

212
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,140
are some of these positions that all

213
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,920
kind of flow up into being a security

214
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,060
engineer well there is sort of the isso

215
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,519
isse role and this may while this may

216
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,660
apply more in a regulated industry uh

217
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,080
these skills are still can be used in

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,860
many commercial or other companies or

219
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,140
organizations because companies still

220
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,480
have policies that they need to apply or

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
write or security policies but you know

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,920
another in regulated Industries you have

223
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,279
compliance you have regulations

224
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,600
and as I said no matter what you're

225
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,060
still writing and enforcing the policies

226
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,820
that your management should have uh you

227
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,800
know it's still best practice even if

228
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,779
you know whether you're a Walmart or

229
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,560
bank to have or Mom and Pop Shop to have

230
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
hey these are the things you should or

231
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
shouldn't do so the isso role in that

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,100
sense then you have a security Arc

233
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,160
architect role this is the person or the

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,339
individual that is actually planning out

235
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,320
where the organization is going as far

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,899
as what how to do security down the line

237
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,000
how to design a secure network how to

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,519
integrate these new technologies how to

239
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,380
be prepared for uh

240
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,240
vulnerabilities and exploits and attacks

241
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,420
and new threats coming down the pipe

242
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,519
they are they should be looking ahead to

243
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,860
what should we be doing how should we be

244
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,959
preparing what should we be budgeting

245
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,700
for in one to two to three to five years

246
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,760
then you have your basic analyst role

247
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
and this is the role we hear a lot of

248
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,839
talk about because this encompasses

249
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,300
encompasses things such as information

250
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I'm sorry such as incident response such

251
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,480
as your sock analyst your eyes on on

252
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,360
glass type and so this person is

253
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,860
monitoring your state of security

254
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,620
posture they're doing that uh response

255
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,620
and investigation and so and they're

256
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,620
looking into incidents but the other

257
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,440
task the other role that that really

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,540
boils up into a security engineer is the

259
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,000
network person the server admin because

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
this is the person that's building the

261
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,120
infrastructure maintaining the

262
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,300
infrastructure keeping it operational

263
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,240
that's making sure that it's accessible

264
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,040
to in this case we're talking about you

265
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,079
being able to log on and get to the data

266
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
talking about a CIA Triad the

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,220
accessibility part of it and making sure

268
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,019
that all of the information is able to

269
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,279
be reached and uh delivered to where its

270
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,360
destination

271
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
and so on top of all of that that's

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,339
where the security engineer comes in

273
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,579
there or that person overlaps all these

274
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,980
things where they are implementing the

275
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,260
architect plans they are working with

276
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,560
the network engineer they are ensuring

277
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
the analysts can do their job and they

278
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,540
are enabling the isso to ensure that

279
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,120
policy and regulations are complied with

280
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,399
requires some hard skills these are the

281
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,200
skills these are the the touchy-feely

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
measurable things

283
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,160
that to be able to do your job and so

284
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,740
infosec right built right into the name

285
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,339
so they uh the security engineer should

286
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,959
be able to understand policies

287
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,720
understand what best practices are they

288
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,480
should know about and understand

289
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,920
vulnerabilities and how things can

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,899
exploit those vulnerabilities they

291
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,940
should be able to understand that how

292
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,399
those things work which leads right into

293
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,100
knowing and understanding uh and even

294
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,200
having some experience with attack and

295
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,019
or defense tools you know how are you

296
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,040
designing your network to stop or detect

297
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,940
um you know Metasploit or or power sport

298
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,220
or any of the tools any of those points

299
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,139
yeah any of this it's a bloodhound yes

300
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,880
right what are these tools what do they

301
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,800
do and how do I know that they're being

302
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,820
used or not used on my network so uh so

303
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,980
this kind of hard skill is you know

304
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,560
obviously built into it but then they

305
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,639
should understand the server

306
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,560
administration because if you're an

307
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,899
engineer you're going to tell the Ops

308
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,779
person this is how we should build these

309
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,959
servers to be secure or work with that

310
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,680
the server Administration Ops and I T to

311
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,199
build secure servers you need to be able

312
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,000
to speak their language and not just

313
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,459
tell them go secure that stuff it's not

314
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,980
so speaking their language understanding

315
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,959
what operating systems do and how they

316
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,920
work how they actually need to be

317
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,720
monitored and administered understanding

318
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,540
how authentication Works how web servers

319
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,300
work how the web platforms work how

320
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,880
databases work understanding all of

321
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,100
these things now you don't have to be an

322
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,320
expert in them but you need to have that

323
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,160
kind of minimal uh you know be able to

324
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,399
again speak the language

325
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,180
then architecture I'm sorry uh then the

326
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,360
network administrator role but this is

327
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
absolutely key understanding how near

328
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,160
network works from your protocols that

329
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,060
are going across the network tcpip uh I

330
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,760
you know bgp understanding just that

331
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,339
communication layer as key to really

332
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,839
being able to design that Network

333
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,579
because you have to understand where

334
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,320
your data is moving into and out of your

335
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,779
and across your network understanding

336
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,699
the infrastructure for your routers or

337
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,260
your switchers your proxies your

338
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,660
firewalls what's going on behind the

339
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,740
scenes what is the impact of just you

340
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,620
know the you know deny all

341
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,660
um you know

342
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,100
Allowed by exception you know the date

343
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,959
be you know permit by exception boy I'm

344
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,160
screwing up my acronyms but uh you know

345
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
understanding that so you can talk to

346
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,300
those things so you know providing

347
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,800
because you're providing that guidance

348
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,260
across the Enterprise

349
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,360
and then finally you know especially

350
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
within the last five ten years it's you

351
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,959
know we're as the move to Cloud

352
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,820
especially in the last two years has

353
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,639
accelerated understanding how that has

354
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,860
impacted how that changes your

355
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,800
engineering and your design and your the

356
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,899
responsibility that you have of your

357
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,660
network because you've shifted where

358
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,480
your data and where your processing

359
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,779
happens so what does that mean for uh

360
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,620
the security and the monitoring of your

361
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,800
network to allow your environment to

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,639
allow your team to continue to function

363
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,100
now you talk about the soft skills guess

364
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,019
what as a security engineer you're not

365
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,120
going to be doing you know a whole lot

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,740
of sitting in front of a keyboard doing

367
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,079
you know coding in the dark corner of

368
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,699
the room you're going to be doing a lot

369
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,000
of documentation so writing is critical

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,959
so memos emails presentations because

371
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,060
you're going to be talking to people to

372
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,800
say hey this is how we should do it and

373
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,360
why we should do it and you have to

374
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
explain that we are I've referenced

375
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
several times talk speaking the language

376
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,980
to other people to so that they are able

377
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,259
to follow along why you're saying we

378
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,019
should you should do X Y and Z you need

379
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,579
project management time management

380
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,920
skills because you're going to be

381
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,019
working on things that take time to

382
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,240
implement where you're migrating from

383
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,100
this version of software to that version

384
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,680
of software you're going from on-prem to

385
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,399
Cloud this is these are multi-step

386
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,680
multi-month or multi-week tasks and you

387
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,480
need that project and time management

388
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
skills to do so people skill bills

389
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,980
you're going to be working on a team

390
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,660
you're going to be leading a team you're

391
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,260
going to be or even if you're not on or

392
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,699
leading a team you're going to have to

393
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,459
be working with other divisions who have

394
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,439
other priorities so you have to have

395
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,419
that kind of people skills of diplomacy

396
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,760
performance Under Pressure because these

397
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,579
projects these tasks will have

398
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,140
visibility across the Enterprise at a

399
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,439
high level so you need to be able to be

400
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,079
diverse in who you're pulling in

401
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,079
um you know and who you use as well as

402
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,080
you know inclusion and that is so

403
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,240
interesting because it's not just saying

404
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,400
hey who am I going to hire but it's who

405
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,860
am I going to work with you know just

406
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,780
because I don't like this person doesn't

407
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,840
mean I I ha I can afford to ignore him

408
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,380
to get my project done you know learning

409
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,120
how to work with all sorts of people is

410
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,280
is key

411
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,120
business skills because you're going to

412
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,700
present projects or proposed projects

413
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,520
and you got to say hey uh you got to

414
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,380
convince management upper level

415
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,900
management why you this project should

416
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,520
be done why should we move to the cloud

417
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,160
why should we buy that software why

418
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,160
should we disable this protocol or or

419
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,400
this whole environment why should we

420
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,220
turn off the data center in you know

421
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Wichita because we already have one you

422
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,860
know in you know in Ashburn DC or

423
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,440
something you know Ashburn Virginia why

424
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,559
should we do all that okay

425
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,440
exactly the one no one knows about

426
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,539
um so business skills are important to

427
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,220
understand if you're a sales engineer

428
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,860
you're convincing customers you know why

429
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,140
this is this is important and if you're

430
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,120
not speaking that sales language you

431
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,460
know you're not going to be able to uh

432
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,320
make that sale or convince the customer

433
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,460
to buy

434
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,679
problem solving attention to detail

435
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
security engineer is a problem solver

436
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,640
but at the end of the day that's what

437
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,280
they're doing you know when Ops comes in

438
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,260
and says we have a new widget that does

439
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,780
you know the Whatchamacallit you know we

440
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,460
want to install it you know you have to

441
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,400
figure out well how does that affect the

442
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,220
security of my environment and how do I

443
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,260
make sure it doesn't affect it too badly

444
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,780
and then the thing that I think is

445
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,820
important for every security person

446
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,700
whether no matter what in a career that

447
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,380
you're in it's just curiosity and

448
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,840
persistence

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,059
um and so

450
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,480
do having those key uh traits just

451
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,340
allows you to go well why how do I get

452
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,380
this to work and trying it and figuring

453
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,539
out a way

454
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,940
so how do you get some of these skills

455
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,020
how do you get some of these

456
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,840
capabilities uh you know is there is

457
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,820
there a single path there's no single

458
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,320
path you guys know this you've been in

459
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
security and you've talked to enough

460
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,620
people there's not a single path but

461
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,440
there are definitely uh options along

462
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,100
the path to form your own uh destination

463
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,520
and so you know today what's interesting

464
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,640
is that there are more colleges uh and

465
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,280
more schools offering security and

466
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,380
security training now both at the

467
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,940
undergraduate and graduate level right

468
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,059
and they vary you know in in quality

469
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,980
right I think it'll take a few years to

470
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,140
kind of shake out what should be taught

471
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,480
at the undergraduate and at The Graduate

472
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,200
level but as that happens you know there

473
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,059
are those options that weren't around

474
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,980
you know definitely not when I was going

475
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,140
to school but they're you know this is a

476
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,000
recent phenomenon so we continue to see

477
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
this growth

478
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,720
uh there are training companies right

479
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
where most of us are very familiar with

480
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,860
who Sans is but there are others Black

481
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,980
Hills is building of quite a bit of a

482
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,539
curriculum of options to do training uh

483
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,700
udemy LinkedIn learning there are boot

484
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,919
camps uh when I was doing my research on

485
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,140
this I found a number of secure infosec

486
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,000
group camps I can't speak to the quality

487
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,440
of them but I've got a lot of links

488
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,620
that'll be at the end of these slides uh

489
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,240
um when we we will put out the slides

490
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,000
and you can go through it so there are a

491
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,760
lot of these options for training you

492
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,380
can do vendor specific training

493
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,299
absolutely if your company or if your

494
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,340
organization says you're going to manage

495
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,200
this thing you first thing you should

496
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,679
ask can I get training on that thing and

497
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
so vendors will very happily sell you

498
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
training on that thing

499
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,100
um so if you're lucky some vendors will

500
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,679
give you training for free

501
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,820
AWS and

502
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,260
which is on Google and Azure and will

503
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,820
absolutely train you for a lot of things

504
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,679
for free because they can lock you into

505
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,919
their environment uh so but that's not

506
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,539
to say it's a bad thing but take

507
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,580
advantage of training whether it's uh

508
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,820
free or paid for absolutely and then we

509
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,799
all know that you're going to have to do

510
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,620
a lot of self self self teaching

511
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,780
self-training and so there's you know

512
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,400
ways to do that coming to conferences

513
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,740
like this thank you guys coming thank

514
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,720
you guys for attending our talk uh but

515
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
you know this is training this is all

516
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,440
good it builds soft skills of you know

517
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,280
and gives you ideas to build hard skills

518
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,580
there is a website uh which again I'll

519
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,500
have what we will have in the references

520
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,780
the national National Initiative for

521
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,760
cyber security careers and studies and I

522
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,559
hate that title but that's what it is

523
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,440
it's really hard but they are great for

524
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,419
understanding what skills you need for

525
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,400
different positions and so if you're

526
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,559
applying for position and you're

527
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,480
thinking well what do I need to be a

528
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,340
system security developer they have a

529
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,159
list of all the kpis all the skills that

530
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,559
you need should have for that great for

531
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,780
employers to help build job descriptions

532
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,860
as well

533
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,659
uh they actually don't have one for

534
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,580
security engineer but if you combine

535
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,740
some of these it does you can you know

536
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,100
it does kind of flesh out

537
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,280
and then you can have uh certifications

538
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
there are a number of search you can uh

539
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,919
can can get that will help you now we

540
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,900
can debate all day long about whether or

541
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,520
not assert is a good thing or a bad

542
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,020
thing and how good they are and how many

543
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,360
you should have I like to say I have

544
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,159
just enough to get me past HR uh so

545
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,559
um that is uh that's my that's my view

546
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,440
of them but they are there and uh they

547
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,260
absolutely can help and if nothing else

548
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,179
some of them they give you especially

549
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:16,980
the beginning of your career we'll give

550
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,780
you some of that foundational training

551
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,120
that you can build upon as you continue

552
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
to grow in your career

553
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,820
so with that uh then let's you know how

554
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,559
does that apply in real life you were

555
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,179
talking you know we were talking about

556
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,419
you know our our uh our Triad yeah yeah

557
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,600
definitely uh introducing the Triad

558
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,820
um we call it the SOB because we thought

559
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,039
that would be really uh more memorable

560
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,320
for you except for some of the other

561
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,720
things and

562
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,760
um what we found out over the career

563
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,000
path is this is that they're basically

564
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,220
a category of things that you're going

565
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,740
to do that we've done in these in these

566
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
areas here we've supported operations

567
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,419
we've talked to vice presidents and

568
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,340
budget people about products and things

569
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,679
and we've been in situations where we're

570
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,600
going to have to respond to security

571
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,059
incidents and things like that so we we

572
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,880
thought that with this Triad and and

573
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,760
with others that that you know that we

574
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,480
could we could have a framework for you

575
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,100
if you're wanting to understand security

576
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,200
and maybe be able to apply some of those

577
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,279
things uh to that so under here details

578
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,860
or or some bullets uh in each category

579
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,539
that we're going to talk about but

580
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,419
essentially uh it is something where we

581
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,460
think that you you should use when

582
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,380
you're considering designing or or

583
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,600
implementing systems and security

584
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,158
controls across your organization

585
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,620
so the security part of the Triad

586
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,659
represents on the function that you need

587
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:52,500
to do or ha or be able to uh Implement

588
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,860
for the control so for instance if we're

589
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,559
looking at products and services to

590
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,539
implement into the company such as in a

591
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,080
virus or or or new IPS IDs or next-gen

592
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
firewalls and things like that there are

593
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,320
a lot of things that you're going to

594
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,980
have to understand about those systems

595
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,900
you know are they compliant do they have

596
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,440
uh the the latest standards and things

597
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,940
like that the gentleman in the previous

598
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,760
talk talked about them being compliant

599
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,500
in terms of encryption standards and so

600
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,179
on and so forth so those things that you

601
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,220
have to understand are they best to

602
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,440
breed are they top vendors or or mid-tip

603
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,940
vendors or are they you know next

604
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,919
Generation stuff that haven't been rated

605
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,620
and things like that but the meantime

606
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,679
the the main ish the the main focus in

607
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,120
this Triad is

608
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,059
does it help me do my job better does it

609
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,340
help me detect stuff better does it help

610
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,220
me find stuff better mitigate stuff you

611
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,740
know what are those things that we do uh

612
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,059
what are those things that we need to

613
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,299
have in this in this uh area to make our

614
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,400
job better not necessarily different

615
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,340
difficult but at least better

616
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,740
so that's that's the main thing and then

617
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,299
we'll have an example of that kind of

618
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,620
shows everything

619
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,400
uh put together for a specific scenario

620
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,100
do you talk about operations and mainly

621
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,620
here we're talking about

622
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,419
supporting the business operations the

623
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,179
security operations or or any any of the

624
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,860
of the functioning parts of the

625
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,419
organization that that you're

626
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,659
responsible for you know do we how much

627
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,640
do we work with it with our operations

628
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,580
teams and things like that what what is

629
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,559
the impact to the security in the

630
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,840
organization are we are we the people

631
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,600
that slows things down speeds things up

632
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,140
uh blocks this or you know or makes

633
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,140
things faster and better are we the no

634
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,260
you can't do that organization or are we

635
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,299
or are we like hey go ahead we'll see

636
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,400
what happens kind of thing so we are

637
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,900
definitely trying to get away with being

638
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,140
the organization of no all right it's

639
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,820
like that we need to leave that way in

640
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,580
the past and then and then finally a key

641
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,260
component of operation is understanding

642
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,179
the entire organization and the

643
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,000
structure of what you're trying to

644
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,860
protect and secure

645
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,860
and finally it's about the business it's

646
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,140
about making sure we're making money or

647
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,779
making things happen or or providing a

648
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,360
service on a consistent basis it's about

649
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,899
the ability to understand

650
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,200
how the security operations uh I'm sorry

651
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,240
how uh Security in general is a business

652
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,399
uh uh value is something that we can

653
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,679
measure a return on investment that we

654
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,320
can measure all these financial

655
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,539
performance indicators because like you

656
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:41,820
said before you might have to be in

657
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,580
front of the c-level folks telling them

658
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,380
why you need to spend two million

659
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,140
dollars on your new networking stack

660
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,299
protocol and what's the benefits to the

661
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,279
company

662
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,720
right and I think the other thing is and

663
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,539
it was mentioned during the panel this

664
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,640
morning is you don't want to be the

665
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,299
friction in the business and so one of

666
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,360
you know we have to be aware of the what

667
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,320
the things we do does it impact profit

668
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,659
or does it impact

669
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,820
um you know whatever the business goals

670
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,120
are you know we cannot as security be

671
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,700
that that that friction because without

672
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,960
a good reason uh that will get shot down

673
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,399
when I say a good reason I don't mean a

674
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,899
good reason that we think it's a good

675
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:29,760
reason I mean the business has to have a

676
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,440
good reason to have any kind of friction

677
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,440
so we need to be cognizant of the tasks

678
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,880
that we do and the things that we want

679
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,460
uh and and its impact on the the

680
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,340
business goals

681
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,200
so with that

682
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,179
there are a lot of scenarios that we can

683
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,059
talk about not hopefully a lot but a a

684
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,880
fair amount of common day scenarios and

685
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
with this one we chose to talk about

686
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,840
attacks on the infrastructure and you

687
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,080
can you know use your imagination to to

688
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,659
understand where where we're going with

689
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,840
this uh it could be anything from uh

690
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,539
local tax pipeline attacks drone attacks

691
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,899
to to you know War you know right but

692
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,940
the overall situation is that that

693
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,020
there's always something that's going on

694
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,640
in your infrastructure that you need to

695
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,100
be aware of right and if you're going to

696
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,720
take that and apply this framework to it

697
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,960
um you can see that there are several

698
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,000
categories that you can kind of you know

699
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,880
begin to work work on your solutions to

700
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,919
your problems right so for the security

701
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,380
side of the infrastructure attacks we're

702
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,039
looking at do we have an increased tax

703
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,020
uh attack surface

704
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,059
we're not just confined to the Network

705
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,100
anymore we're now going social we're

706
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,220
going you know iocs and and devices and

707
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,559
and all kinds of other things that are

708
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,419
maybe outside the perimeter of the

709
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,539
company you know does this affect our

710
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,840
ability to meet uh to mitigate things to

711
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,820
detect and mitigate and respond and

712
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,480
contain and what technology improvements

713
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,940
do we need to have in this area you know

714
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,159
because you know you know all Palo Alto

715
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,380
may not be able to to do all this stuff

716
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,299
or you may have to get a web application

717
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,880
firewall or you may have to look at

718
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,700
maybe getting some kind of external uh

719
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,179
uh news service such as uh was it uh

720
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,059
extra hops things like that right well

721
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,100
the the technology also comes into play

722
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,960
as you start bringing in you know we've

723
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,580
talked you know for a number of years in

724
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,100
the industry about protecting OT as we

725
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,440
start bringing ICS uh you know you think

726
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,279
about water or or electricity or you

727
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,919
know other types of what traditionally

728
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,679
was not connected to the internet and

729
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,779
suddenly is and so some of those

730
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,720
technology improvements some of those

731
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,000
Technologies

732
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,679
do not fall under the realm of our

733
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,899
normal security tools so we have to

734
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,659
understand how to bring in those new new

735
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,000
tools and new new monitoring

736
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,740
capabilities exactly

737
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,840
and then what does that mean for your

738
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,700
overall organization how much does this

739
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,320
affect your socks does this mean that

740
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,580
they're going to be doing more work

741
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,380
they're going to have to figure out

742
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,159
what's going on quickly quick quickly or

743
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,140
quicker quicker quicker that's the more

744
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,600
that's the word uh you know what's the

745
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,820
increase in security operations what is

746
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,380
the

747
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,120
point to where we had to bring in more

748
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,100
teams right so that's that's from

749
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,140
operations perspective because we may

750
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,179
not have expertise in drone attacks

751
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,860
right so we might have to figure out how

752
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,440
to get other teams involved or maybe

753
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,539
even other vendors involved as well uh

754
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:40,860
going back to the vendor thing again

755
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,760
it's dicey right uh so and then finally

756
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,779
you know

757
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,720
at some point you know the business is

758
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,240
aware of what's going on and they want

759
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,600
to be able to uh understand

760
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,720
how this is affecting how attacks on

761
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,159
their infrastructure are affecting their

762
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,899
business will it affect resource

763
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,059
constraints will it affect Personnel

764
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,179
will it affect you know them shutting

765
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,279
your you down your reputation yeah

766
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,980
exactly and if something catastrophic

767
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,220
were to happen to something or to a part

768
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,640
of your your organization so again those

769
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,260
are the things that when you're looking

770
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,120
at a tax on infrastructure from a

771
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,299
security engineering perspective uh

772
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,080
um

773
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,519
the solutions can become uh or the the

774
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,559
the approaches to solving the problem

775
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,419
can become

776
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,820
um uh vast but if you have a framework

777
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,500
you can kind of hone in on some of the

778
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,840
key and major things that you want to to

779
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,919
uh to to work on so with that you know

780
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,340
uh again a solution may be that we might

781
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,260
move our stem to the cloud so they could

782
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,539
be resilient it could be available 24 7

783
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,960
and be uh uh maybe hopefully better

784
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,240
protected from infrastructure attacks

785
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,320
and things like that could be available

786
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,240
to anyone who's remote as opposed to

787
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,580
exactly exactly so

788
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,220
and with operations you know

789
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,919
um we we can consider integrating in

790
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,080
threat intelligence teams uh hunting

791
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,940
teams penetration testing teams to

792
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,179
augment our uh our monitoring and and

793
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,000
evaluation of the attack surface and

794
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,279
then with business you know we can we

795
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,580
can definitely focus on uh ensuring

796
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,559
content continuity and resilience and

797
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,299
making sure that operations stay up and

798
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,080
focused or we can really fortify return

799
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,580
on investments for all these services

800
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,559
and things that we're asking our

801
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,940
management to to to uh to invest in so

802
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,100
as a security engineer like we said

803
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,960
before you know understanding those

804
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,600
those things and categorizing those with

805
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,140
your solutions to the problem uh I think

806
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,299
you know this Triad is is representative

807
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:55,440
of something that to help you uh down uh

808
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,539
with your careers and and with what you

809
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,340
want to do as a security engineer and

810
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,080
give you a framework of what you need to

811
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,899
learn going forward I think it helps

812
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,880
additionally really helps frame the

813
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,679
decisions that you need to make every

814
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,599
day it helps Focus uh what tasks that

815
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,040
you need to do and why you need to do it

816
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,219
it helps you really bring bring all that

817
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:20,699
concept into a methodology that you can

818
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,159
use to talk to your peers talk to your

819
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,800
management and even talk to your uh the

820
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,260
people that you know

821
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,800
your employees are or your mentees so

822
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,540
that they better understand what they're

823
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,980
doing and why they're doing it is

824
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,159
important in their daily tasks and one

825
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,379
other thing is that all of these things

826
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,119
here in the framework and what we're

827
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,079
talking about is really that underlying

828
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,780
training of leadership right because you

829
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,639
always wonder like how do you get to be

830
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,040
CEO or or vice president or something

831
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,020
and very few technical people become

832
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,420
CEOs and vice president because normally

833
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,040
you have to understand the business side

834
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,260
of an organization but nowadays you have

835
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,160
the Cecil row you have all these other

836
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,500
intermediary sea level roles and with

837
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,780
with what we're learning here and our

838
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,359
experiences in security engineering

839
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,800
you're really getting to a point where

840
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,420
you're training yourself to be a leader

841
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,180
or having those experiences and being a

842
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,460
leader and hopefully lead the

843
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,980
organization further yeah

844
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,079
so the need for security Engineers

845
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,540
continues to grow

846
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,140
um you know in inc.com in just a few

847
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,060
months ago said this is one of the three

848
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,880
key areas that that organizations need

849
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,339
to hire not more analysts you know I

850
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,200
mean yes more analysts yes more incident

851
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,359
responders but they should have a

852
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,300
security engineer also as marked as one

853
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,920
of the things they need to that that

854
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,200
they need to hire and it's simply oh

855
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,720
thank you it's simply because uh

856
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,160
Engineers look at the broad spectrum

857
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,020
understanding these three pillars these

858
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,420
three areas whether you know whether

859
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,859
you're using the framework or not but

860
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,359
understanding those three areas and

861
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,339
understanding the impact across the

862
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:09,000
environment so uh you know what really

863
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,820
struck me was that uh so for those of

864
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,040
you who are you know us-based to under

865
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,200
you know who uh or even in and around

866
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
the federal government

867
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,619
Biden released the executive order 14208

868
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,859
and and I mean a quarter of my life in

869
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,599
the last year has been taken anyone else

870
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,420
super impacted by that because basically

871
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,640
a quarter of my life if you if it hasn't

872
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,300
let's just say that the number of

873
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,359
security initiatives in this document is

874
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,900
redonkulous that is an official word so

875
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,780
it is quite a bit anywhere from zero

876
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,660
trust to

877
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,579
endpoint or security to additional

878
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,980
logging to multi-factor all of it is now

879
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,040
codified in this executive order that

880
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,220
federal agencies DOD included need to

881
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,020
comply with so

882
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,720
uh and he said hey if you are not

883
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,200
including a security engineer in this

884
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,480
initiative in these initiatives this

885
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,400
will not work because you can't just

886
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,079
hire a security analyst and then tell

887
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,260
them hey go figure out how to implement

888
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,579
multi-factor authentication across an

889
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,460
agency that that's an engineering job

890
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,680
how do I do that because it's more than

891
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,560
just you know what a security analyst

892
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,380
traditionally does and so yes that

893
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,000
security analyst can become a security

894
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,980
engineer but understand the thing he is

895
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,420
doing is not analysts it's an

896
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,300
engineering role and so that is his

897
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,040
point

898
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,099
so you look at showing the money right I

899
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,240
am showing the money let's show the

900
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,920
money so what are we talking about you

901
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,740
know okay spoiler alert uh in case you

902
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,839
didn't already see the slide there are

903
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,640
security jobs out there there's a lot of

904
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,660
them

905
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,359
um this slide really is just focused on

906
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,760
a security engineering

907
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,160
um and what we pulled from we pulled

908
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,400
from two sites Dice and indeed.com uh

909
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,160
you can see it and indeed it was 11 000

910
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,480
jobs this is uh 2021 yeah late yes only

911
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,920
a couple of months ago but we did update

912
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,900
the Baltimore Maryland slide recently

913
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,700
yeah we did so let's call them there

914
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,380
yeah trying to be a little bit you know

915
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,300
focused on this area you know Baltimore

916
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,280
Maryland there's 1900 security

917
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,740
engineering jobs open you know as of

918
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,140
right now they're you know so they're

919
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,320
looking for uh people to do this gig

920
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,119
right I understand yeah there's a ton of

921
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,920
them you can pick and choose but this is

922
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,440
a specialty that's you know right off

923
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,859
the bat is is a mid six figure job yeah

924
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,619
and uh and I was talking with Craig

925
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,599
earlier this morning I said you know

926
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,480
we're trying to update this chart I'm

927
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,119
now seeing Junior and entry-level cyber

928
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,820
security engineering jobs offered now

929
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,800
well I will say there's Junior jobs but

930
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,880
you and I were saying I don't think

931
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,240
there's not an entry level job now in a

932
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,980
sense because again this is not an entry

933
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,540
they're not coming out of college and

934
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,560
saying I'm going to be a security

935
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,020
engineer you don't have enough

936
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,599
foundational experience

937
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:09,720
to to be able to do this I was uh so

938
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,260
Jack recider guy does a dark net Diaries

939
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,579
if you haven't listened to dark neck

940
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,000
Diaries go listen that's great podcast

941
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,420
um but Jack recider just put out a

942
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,119
Twitter Thread about the you know the

943
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,859
like 20 things he's learned as a

944
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,380
security engineer and one of them was

945
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,520
you know talking about the difference

946
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,680
between Junior and senior security of

947
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,200
folks is that you know a junior person

948
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,099
may have enough or the same skill

949
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,560
knowledge technical technical knowledge

950
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,000
thank you the same technical knowledge

951
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,740
is a senior person but the difference is

952
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,900
the senior person knows when and how to

953
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,060
apply it and the business and

954
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,420
operational impacts of that Implement

955
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,280
implementation it's so it's really

956
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,800
that's the concept and so sure you can

957
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,300
come out of college having the right

958
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,780
skills but it just don't have that you

959
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,579
know life experience to know when and

960
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,079
how to apply that stuff

961
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,119
so

962
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,619
um but it's it is interesting as you

963
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:11,880
said that you're starting to see those

964
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,720
Junior things so

965
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,420
just you know reminder hey this covid-19

966
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,819
has you know impacted everything right

967
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,760
exactly exactly work from home telework

968
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,980
you know this impacts you know how we

969
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,200
design and Implement security across the

970
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,480
board I'm pretty sure a lot of you had

971
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,960
to augment your VPN and zoom

972
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,720
Communications and infrastructures right

973
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,579
over the last couple years so what's

974
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:39,540
next

975
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,819
uh presidential orders still in effect

976
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,099
it's halfway through is still going on

977
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,480
and we're going to see the repercussions

978
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,220
of that for years

979
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,859
zero trust

980
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,500
automation yeah all of this involves

981
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,480
engineering

982
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,319
yeah automation is our topical word for

983
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,599
machine learning stuff and and data

984
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,960
analytics so uh an automated response an

985
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,119
automated response you know so when the

986
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,060
robots take over you know uh cyber

987
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,140
security jobs you know

988
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,060
the infrastructure is code yes that is

989
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,619
something else that's coming it's very

990
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,900
fast this is uh

991
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,359
um but here's where we disagree yeah

992
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,420
yeah so securing the blockchain and what

993
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,859
this is going to affect you know these

994
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,180
are things that are coming up these are

995
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,540
going to be security Avenues uh that you

996
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,400
know we kind of he thinks that is I

997
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,780
don't have so much of an opinion but

998
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,800
okay we put it to the audience

999
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,859
um pandemics and uh has been very

1000
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,660
obvious in the last couple months War

1001
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,119
yeah just you know these are things that

1002
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,680
we are going to have to engineer to

1003
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,760
protect

1004
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,280
exactly one of the things about that is

1005
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,839
that there's a lot of story out there

1006
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,160
there's a lot of people dealing with

1007
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,900
misinformation there's a lot of people

1008
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,420
trying to protect not only their

1009
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,420
companies in Ukraine and and and relate

1010
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,740
it but they're also trying to to

1011
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,020
train up even the I.T people to help

1012
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,839
defend those lines so a very good very

1013
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,000
good point about you know how security

1014
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,980
engineering is very reactive to

1015
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,420
situations and things like that

1016
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,079
um you wanted to give that dedication

1017
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,900
yeah oh okay uh also like I said uh we

1018
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,060
had a friend of ours uh pass away

1019
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,500
several months ago our name was

1020
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,440
Stephanie Schaefer I just wanted to uh

1021
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,319
give her a dedication dedicate this talk

1022
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,140
to her uh she was a big force in

1023
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,839
security and Engineering I worked with

1024
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,119
her for several years and she was very

1025
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,420
an advocate of women in cyber security

1026
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,260
so I just wanted to say that peace but

1027
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,540
thank you for allowing us to come and

1028
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,000
talk to you today right and there's our

1029
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,420
our contact information uh you can reach

1030
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,579
out to us at any time these slides will

1031
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,700
be posted if they're not posted already

1032
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,079
this is a bit of an update from our

1033
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,500
previous talk time we did this

1034
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,520
and one of the reasons we want to make

1035
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,260
sure we post these slides is because we

1036
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,619
have a crap ton of

1037
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:14,240
so

1038
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,520
so of stuff so with that we'll take any

1039
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,780
questions we've got time for some

1040
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,500
questions yes

1041
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,500
unless you're all visibly or oddly or

1042
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,260
intellectually stunned about security

1043
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,640
Engineers yes ma'am

1044
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,760
what are the best kinds of I.T systems

1045
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,819
what kind of skills do they focus on

1046
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,000
so what are the best I.T skills for

1047
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,740
people who want to come into security

1048
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,300
engineer

1049
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,240
you go so

1050
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,310
[Music]

1051
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,200
the slide where I talked about those

1052
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,260
different uh skill sets so understanding

1053
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,660
you know operating systems and what you

1054
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,760
know what a server administrator does

1055
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,619
and how to build domains you know so

1056
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,540
having a

1057
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,760
having a solid understanding of that I'm

1058
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,920
not saying expert right because there is

1059
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,079
no way I'm an expert in building an ad I

1060
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,839
know just enough to build one but you

1061
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,520
know if Trimark came in there they would

1062
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,680
laugh me out the room so I know enough

1063
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
to how why you know how to build one so

1064
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
under you know eight server

1065
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,500
Administration Network Administration

1066
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,680
absolutely understanding how routers and

1067
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,140
switches and firewalls and or how that

1068
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,940
the network transport protocols work uh

1069
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,160
and you know basic understanding of just

1070
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,260
pulling apart TCP packets and how those

1071
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,920
flow DNS HTTP understanding those those

1072
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,440
protocols and then obviously having a

1073
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,599
really good you know if anything you

1074
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,099
want to be deep in knowledge on of

1075
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,160
everything it's the security uh skills

1076
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,160
understanding attack and defense and

1077
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,079
understanding as exploits and

1078
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,200
vulnerabilities why and how and you know

1079
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,660
the you know you know understanding what

1080
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,520
the heck of buffer overflow is and all

1081
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,640
of those things privilege escalations so

1082
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,680
those are the things that you really

1083
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,240
should have that kind of knowledge of

1084
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,940
and now now I did tag on this Cloud as

1085
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,160
well but and that's important too

1086
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,920
because there's a whole shift and so so

1087
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,020
you know again having good

1088
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,420
understandings of server cloud and

1089
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,220
network and a deep understanding

1090
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,720
security

1091
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,839
um if you can throw in some policy and

1092
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:44,760
uh understanding and compliance and

1093
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,099
regulation understanding that's good but

1094
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,020
it's I'm not going to say it's required

1095
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,119
but it's it's good because it gives that

1096
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,020
round rounded ability so that's where I

1097
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,400
would I would you know that's where I

1098
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
would look to you know if they're weak

1099
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,819
in any one of those I would build it up

1100
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,240
there I I would add to that uh you

1101
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,700
should also explore parallel so for

1102
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,980
instance if you've been a person who's

1103
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,619
an application maybe you did some kind

1104
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,000
of business application or something

1105
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,760
like that you might parallel to software

1106
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,560
development or you might parallel to

1107
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,660
database management or something like

1108
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,440
that or some products where you you can

1109
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,420
analyze what's going on under the under

1110
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,560
the rim a lot of people uh who solve

1111
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,560
problems mostly been end up becoming

1112
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,900
penetration testers until they get tired

1113
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,119
of things like that I don't know I

1114
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,700
became a security engineer

1115
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,000
but but you know because because of that

1116
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,560
you know because a lot of people would

1117
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,300
see security Engineers like oh this is

1118
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,920
thing you have to have 15 20 years of

1119
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,200
experience to be I need something that I

1120
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,900
have my my current I.T skill sets and I

1121
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,339
want to go you know kind of moving in

1122
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,140
that so always look for parallels like

1123
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,180
what are you doing now and what what

1124
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,220
what is the parallel thing that you can

1125
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,280
do just to get into the barrier and then

1126
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,079
you can Elevate from there

1127
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,020
yep cool thank you great question yes

1128
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,140
sir

1129
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,660
yes

1130
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,559
okay let me let me yeah sure repeat them

1131
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,319
uh so the question is it seems that a

1132
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,180
lot of companies are Outsourcing their

1133
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,940
security services what skills or things

1134
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,540
can Engineers do to keep themselves busy

1135
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,059
or I would say paraphrases say employed

1136
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:47,460
or more valuable to the company right

1137
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,859
good question good question so first of

1138
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,480
all it's hard to Outsource security

1139
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,540
engineering because that part needs a

1140
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,300
deep understanding of the actual

1141
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,339
environment that that's being engineered

1142
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:02,579
and I see this because what sometimes

1143
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,440
happens as a consultant you know my

1144
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,059
company has called and said hey we want

1145
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:08,579
to implement X and I have to ask a lot

1146
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,220
of questions just to under try and get a

1147
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,020
good even make a decent recommendation

1148
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,480
and even then ninety percent of the time

1149
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,160
they're like oh that won't work because

1150
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,079
you know such and such in you know

1151
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,760
accounting does this that way well I

1152
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,960
didn't know that you know I can't

1153
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,020
project that I'm outside the company so

1154
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,180
it's really hard to Outsource that

1155
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,059
having said that the skills still apply

1156
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:31,800
but wouldn't the skill that you have to

1157
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,020
then grow in especially if you're going

1158
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,220
to stay in security engineering is

1159
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,780
because you can go to these Consulting

1160
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,520
companies is you have to grow in the

1161
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,720
ability and that some of the people

1162
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,640
skills and learning how to ask the right

1163
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,460
questions and then interpret the answers

1164
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,859
to be able to

1165
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:49,619
develop appropriate Solutions and so

1166
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,720
that's that's a challenging thing I mean

1167
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,460
I've been working on that for two years

1168
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,760
as I've in this new role as I I came out

1169
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,220
of Government Contracting and into this

1170
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,760
more salesy role

1171
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,220
and so that's a very in that's a very

1172
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,319
different skill to that's a people skill

1173
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,059
that I've had to develop of saying okay

1174
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,220
well what about this and what do you do

1175
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,619
here and how does this work and and

1176
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,599
getting the right answers and then

1177
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,640
working with who can I talk to that has

1178
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,200
that information when can you get back

1179
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,180
to me on that so

1180
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,400
um but that's how you kind of build it

1181
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,839
because if you're not doing security

1182
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,700
engineering internal for your own

1183
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,400
organization you can do it external for

1184
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,380
as a consultant

1185
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,780
and I would add to that that you will

1186
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,319
probably expand on what you do for your

1187
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,480
company going forward so for instance

1188
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,700
not all things security engineering have

1189
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,380
to be in security engineering you could

1190
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,440
have stuff that go into legal or Pro uh

1191
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,380
other PA person or you might have to go

1192
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,420
to operations and help solve problems

1193
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,640
there so showing that you can solve

1194
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,559
problems in other areas of the company

1195
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,559
that may not be security would be a

1196
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,380
great asset for you to to continue to

1197
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,540
work there or work you know gain the

1198
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,940
skill that you need to to move up in the

1199
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,040
company

1200
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,660
yep yes yeah sure

1201
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:34,619
so the question is how do you maintain

1202
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,960
awareness of solutions and things like

1203
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,960
that for when you want to uh recommend

1204
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,859
those to your company basically

1205
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,599
um well so sometimes you get lucky and

1206
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,400
work for a vendor that has like 500 a

1207
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,680
company that has like 500

1208
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,260
um Partners

1209
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,599
um but other times you just

1210
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,400
so Twitter helps

1211
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,200
um

1212
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,300
uh blogs

1213
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,319
um just reading security mags magazines

1214
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,420
sometimes honestly I'm just I just

1215
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,180
Google I'm like I just Google

1216
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,720
recommended you know uh edrs and then I

1217
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,740
just

1218
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,140
skim through the bazillion articles that

1219
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,780
I get back and what you know in in

1220
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,640
today's world sometimes I have to go

1221
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,520
okay if it shows up on eight lists that

1222
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,160
are semi-independent because you got to

1223
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,079
be careful of sources but if they show

1224
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,000
up on eight send my independent lists

1225
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,680
then okay that I'm going to say that

1226
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,079
they're probably okay and then I start

1227
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,940
narrowing it down so it takes a lot of

1228
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,839
that

1229
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,460
um kind of digging in and sometimes it's

1230
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,900
a just-in-time thing because your

1231
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,180
company says oh we need you know we need

1232
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,040
an xdr and you're like I've never heard

1233
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,140
of this thing and so now you're quickly

1234
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,839
doing research on that so part of it is

1235
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,300
knowing how to do research and gather

1236
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,339
information in a very time efficient

1237
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,680
manner so I didn't put that in there but

1238
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,960
research is definitely a something I do

1239
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,160
a lot

1240
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,800
uh I I'd add to that uh product

1241
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,020
evaluation

1242
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,640
I know uh I'd add to that product

1243
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,540
evaluations and uh and making sure that

1244
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,099
like if you're really strong in one

1245
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:14,400
product uh that you can compare the

1246
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,920
capabilities and and inaccuracies of

1247
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,900
that product with the other ones to see

1248
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,700
if you can determine that so doing

1249
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,400
product evaluations is because a lot of

1250
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,740
times a lot of vendors will allow you to

1251
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,420
try something out for free or whatever

1252
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,420
and you you can definitely uh do that so

1253
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,220
uh the other thing I would recommend

1254
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,599
also uh look at the certifications such

1255
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:38,940
as uh I forget it's like the JD Power

1256
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,619
Associates of cyber security products or

1257
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:42,480
whatever there's some standards out

1258
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,400
there you know Gartner and things like

1259
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,619
that that can can also help you with

1260
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,540
your research with that but but

1261
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,579
definitely those those kinds of things

1262
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,619
of like I said keeping abreast of what's

1263
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,020
on in social media what's going on in

1264
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,880
technology

1265
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,380
yeah coming to cons looking at who's

1266
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,960
talking about and things like that that

1267
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,880
that's how that that's a good way of

1268
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,400
doing that as well

1269
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,339
one one last one last one I think one

1270
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:09,839
last question

1271
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,480
get a free Coke can of Starlight Coke

1272
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,800
Starlight

1273
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,940
that that stuff is good it's really good

1274
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,099
well awesome well thank you again thank

1275
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:22,680
