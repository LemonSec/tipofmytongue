time to process and take a little bit of

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,680

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,899
less caffeinated than normal but uh

um thank you guys like this is the first

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,119
I've had audiences just like Pony up

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,439
coffee this is gonna be great I'm gonna

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
remember this

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,960
um

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,060
so before I talk about what we're going

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,500
to talk about today Beyond this title

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,760
let me talk a little bit about who I am

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,260
and why I'm here because I want to kind

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,780
of set the tone a little bit for why I'm

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,420
standing back here to talk to you today

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,299
um I've been in infosec for my entire

37
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,220
career just about

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,540
um actually grew up in food service with

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,580
my family but moved into Tech when I was

40
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,960
pretty young

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,420
and uh started my current government I

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,860
did a little backwards where a lot of

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,659
folks retire into government and end

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,040
their careers there I started there

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,880
spent 15 years in a variety of jobs

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,619
mostly the state and local level but I

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,420
got loaned out to some federal programs

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,740
that

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,600
gonna I'm gonna do the cliche thing I'm

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,880
sorry I'm still not really able to talk

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
a lot about it but needless to say I was

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,939
building an incident response programs

53
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,159
for some agencies like 20 years ago or

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,420
so

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,500
um working in government's an

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,520
interesting thing when you start your

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,159
career because aside from it being five

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,200
years behind in everything we always

59
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,119
like to joke about it's a great

60
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,740
opportunity to kind of do everything

61
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,720
because they had nothing

62
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,580
in fact one of the county agencies I

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,360
worked for was indicted by a grand jury

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,120
for showing negligence of taxpayer money

65
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
because they didn't have a security

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,700
program in place to protect a little

67
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,319
over a billion dollars of tax revenue

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,000
that year

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,099
and a security team was formed and I got

70
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,540
to be part of that and that's where I

71
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,860
started I literally had to do it all

72
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,200
install tools do the Ops side of it

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
build policies train people all of it

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
it was actually a really great starter

75
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
for my career I touched on a lot of

76
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
different areas

77
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
and as time went on I got into the

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,879
private sector I led teams I was a CSO

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,040
at a few small organizations I got a new

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,319
executive Consulting for a while which I

81
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,760
like to refer to as organizational

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,500
psychology which is really what I was

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,599
doing it's all people stuff right they

84
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,580
come in and tell you why doesn't our

85
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,379
security program work it's like because

86
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,780
people are involved like there's no

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,160
magic here you don't need to buy more

88
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,200
tools you have the tools we just got to

89
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,819
get everybody on board

90
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,700
so I stand here today I work for tenable

91
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
in full disclosure

92
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,659
as um

93
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,760
kind of I guess the field CSO for the

94
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,959
company you can kind of think of me as

95
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,760
that way but I live in kind of this

96
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
weird place where I don't work in sales

97
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,780
or marketing I get to do this to come in

98
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,120
places and talk to people and even for

99
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,739
our customers I do some advisory work

100
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,420
still to this day

101
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,000
and uh I love that kind of role because

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
I've seen a lot of crazy things go down

103
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,840
over my career

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,180
um we all have our stories but 15 years

105
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,920
in government let me tell you I have

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
some doozies

107
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,739
but

108
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,599
but what I've seen is a kind of a Common

109
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,120
Thread through all the challenges and

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,340
the obstacles and the why doesn't it

111
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,379
work and how do we do it better

112
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,239
we always focus on the the whole people

113
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,299
process technology thing or tools and we

114
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,580
like tools at our heart We're All Tech

115
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,220
Geeks right we all love our tools but

116
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,560
people is what makes this work

117
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,840
and so that's really what I want to talk

118
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,040
about today you're talking about risk

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,780
decision making and talking about

120
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,840
communication is really a story about

121
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,159
how do we leverage what we have better

122
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,280
ways we may not be thinking

123
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
and how do we talk about it to audiences

124
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,320
that do not understand what we do

125
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,720
because while we consider this room and

126
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
talk anecdotes all day long about

127
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,720
security stuff

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,520
your Chief Financial Officer doesn't

129
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,020
know what we do your CEO doesn't

130
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
understand what we do general counsel

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,500
doesn't understand what we do and

132
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,120
frankly we

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
we kind of have to figure out how to

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,540
talk to them better

135
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,680
so that's what we're going to talk a

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
little bit about today I'm going to walk

137
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
you through some observations and things

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
that I've seen

139
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,360
um about how organizations make risk

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,639
decisions which is spoiler alert not

141
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,020
great

142
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,139
going to show an example of uh using

143
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,720
some some new tool or old tools and new

144
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
ways specifically attack path analysis

145
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,440
talk about it using in kind of a

146
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,940
preventative mindset rather than a

147
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,740
reactive post-mortem thing

148
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
and then we'll talk about

149
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,940
communication really I just want to talk

150
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,979
about talking because at the end of the

151
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,000
day

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,400
where I see success and failure for a

153
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,560
lot of security teams is in how they

154
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,660
communicate and it's something that we

155
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,080
have to get better at we simply must

156
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,419
uh and we'll talk about some ways to do

157
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,039
that and some ideas and I'll show you

158
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,780
some examples and we'll go from there

159
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,919
sound good

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
long-winded intro

161
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,979
I love Notting heads you guys haven't

162
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,139
nodded off yet we're getting there so

163
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,120
look when I talk to c-level Executives

164
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,979
it's the same thing I hear all the time

165
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,440
I know it's bad there's a lot of

166
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,000
problems

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,919
I don't even know where to start

168
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,539
that's really the the question that

169
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,060
comes down right where do we start now

170
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,560
we could listen you know read the news

171
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,020
all the time and on a given day it's a

172
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,360
different story right some School

173
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,800
District gets hit with some ransomware

174
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,660
and shuts the whole thing out ransomware

175
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,979
obviously ransomware is the problem we

176
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,240
better focus there

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,699
and the next day it's the uh was it

178
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,919
Capital One with their data loss from a

179
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,780
misconfigured S3 bucket up okay so Cloud

180
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,280
Cloud's the problem better lock that

181
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,860
down that's the problem now and the

182
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,419
given day the given data breach whatever

183
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,860
it is

184
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,840
we hear all these things are the number

185
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,180
one problems but that doesn't help me

186
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,699
figure out where to start and I still

187
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,319
have that problem right I have a small

188
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,240
team small budget

189
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
could be a team of one that's a really

190
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,500
small team right uh I can't do it all we

191
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
know we can't do it all so we got to

192
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,979
start where it matters we need to figure

193
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,720
that out trying to answer that question

194
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,300
about where to start is really key now

195
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,240
some security teams have strategies for

196
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,100
doing that

197
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,919
um you know compliance I see that a lot

198
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,419
in fed space whenever we don't really

199
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,800
want to think about where to start we'll

200
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
just go down a checklist

201
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,039
but as we all know compliance is not

202
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,080
security so yes you're doing something

203
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,660
but are you really yeah meaning yeah

204
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,919
kind of

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,380
uh some people just figure it out right

206
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,819
we'll just guess at what we can do this

207
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,259
week I don't have a good relationship

208
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,940
with my Dev team so we're not fixing any

209
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,460
of the code flaws but hey let's try to

210
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,900
patch something because patching's

211
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,039
pretty easy

212
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,840
all right we do what we can in that

213
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,280
regard

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,620
if you're like I am or your teams are

215
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,199
like I was when I my very first CSO job

216
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,819
that I ever had

217
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,160
I was the first column

218
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,500
um based on the west coast I had a CEO

219
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
that was based on the east coast and had

220
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
no respect for time zones

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,500
and uh I was that person who quite

222
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,819
literally got the phone call at five

223
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,479
o'clock in the morning

224
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,240
you know I'm useless when I don't have

225
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,380
coffee and you're calling me at five

226
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,599
o'clock in the morning what do you want

227
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,460
but that's how it happened right and

228
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,340
look whether I liked it or not didn't

229
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,840
matter what I wanted to do with my team

230
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,860
that day

231
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
myself and my team we had just gotten

232
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,259
prioritized

233
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,819
because when the CEO says he wants to

234
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,139
know the answer to the question are we

235
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,460
next

236
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,800
that's your day or maybe you're weak

237
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
right so

238
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,479
organizations try they try to figure out

239
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,280
we know we have all this risk we know

240
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
that we've got to solve it

241
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
and we're kind of just struggling to

242
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,280
figure out ways to do that

243
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,319
where this comes though is a kind of a

244
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,720
challenge is that where we've tried to

245
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,360
protect ourselves in the past and

246
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,919
because we're not good at this problem

247
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,800
has left us pretty wide open

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,620
the the people of course who don't have

249
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,599
any challenge with deciding where to

250
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,599
start first are the attackers right as

251
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,520
Technologies expanded as we've moved

252
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,279
into more and more uh types of

253
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,719
Technology Cloud resources

254
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,458
virtualization platforms web

255
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,339
applications we're seeing more

256
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,080
OT environments getting connected in of

257
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,660
course credentials have really become

258
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,000
the core of every every attack chain we

259
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
see these days

260
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,779
um we give attackers a lot of options

261
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,240
and frankly they'll take them right

262
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,360
they're not picky uh if you're doing a

263
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,519
really good job patching but your web

264
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,680
applications are super weak

265
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
I'll launch SQL injection tax I'm not

266
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm not picky I don't care

267
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
so we give the attackers lots of options

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,940
and they'll pivot to whatever matters

269
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,380
but think about what we've done as an

270
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,959
industry what we've done as Defenders

271
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,720
when we build Security Programs for all

272
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,580
this technology we tend to look at the

273
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
technology level and we say well you

274
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,959
know all right I want to solve the web

275
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,000
application problem

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
so I'm going to hire some pen testers

277
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,540
who are really good at web apps I'm

278
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,920
going to arm them with some really good

279
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,420
pen testing tools I'll give them burp

280
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,240
suite and you know let them go and tell

281
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,740
them here's our web apps here's the the

282
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,019
space go secure it and we build

283
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,120
ourselves an appsec team and we solve

284
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
that problem

285
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
and then we say okay well we need a

286
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,660
patch so we build a threatened

287
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
vulnerability management team same thing

288
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,720
like Windows and Linux experts and we

289
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,100
teach them to do that we give them the

290
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,080
tools and we build that team

291
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,760
and we do that for all these technology

292
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,100
types and then we find ourselves in an

293
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,320
industry today where every seal

294
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,180
executive I know complains about how

295
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,920
everything's siled

296
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,899
we've siled our tools we've siled our

297
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,060
people we don't talk to each other we

298
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,640
don't understand each other we've we're

299
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,760
fragmented and and it's true

300
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
when I work with large organizations

301
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,420
today you know I can go to the cloud

302
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,680
architects

303
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
and talk to them about how they're

304
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,220
securing the cloud platforms but if I

305
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,920
ask the question great but if one of

306
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,660
these things is compromised is there any

307
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,820
chance that this can lead to back-end

308
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,560
databases

309
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,820
that's not my problem I'm not the

310
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,920
database admin I'm the cloud guy I don't

311
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,180
care

312
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,120
so we have a disconnect here right we

313
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
trying to do the right thing we created

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,600
the silos that we complain about today

315
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,160
but the attackers don't care about any

316
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,140
of that and this is where the disconnect

317
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,399
happens

318
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,100
if we can start to look at our

319
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,140
environments the threat landscape all

320
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,279
the buzzwords we're going to use about

321
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,540
these things

322
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,940
in a more horizontal kind of way in a

323
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,420
more in a way where it all relates

324
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,399
then we can start to give ourselves a

325
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,019
place where we can make slightly better

326
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,120
decisions about where we should start

327
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,820
that's the goal of this right because if

328
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,079
we think about defense in-depth

329
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,660
strategies

330
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,680
they all kind of come down to this I

331
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,940
pick your framework of choice we've been

332
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,040
doing this for a long time some of them

333
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,779
have five steps some have three four

334
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,760
whatever I like to boil it down to three

335
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
these are mine

336
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,519
you have some amount of preventative

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,320
control of some amount of reactive

338
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,420
things and of course you have a response

339
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,100
recovery program when it all goes bad

340
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,980
now my definition for the first two

341
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,200
though really comes down to the type of

342
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,160
data

343
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,019
that you're dealing with

344
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,579
and this is important for the tool sets

345
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,040
as well because in the reactive World

346
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,779
we're looking at some kind of event

347
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,880
taking place and responding to it trying

348
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,279
to stop the malicious behavior or the

349
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,700
bad packet or whatever the attack is the

350
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,720
thing that we don't want in the

351
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,220
environment right so there's something

352
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,600
happening

353
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,540
and then in the preventative side really

354
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,339
prevention is about understanding the

355
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,440
state of the environment

356
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,300
where are all the holes in the walls

357
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,820
where are the places we've left doors

358
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,459
open and windows unlocked right

359
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,079
I like to think of this in some regards

360
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,579
as you know um

361
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,140
preventative controls is locking down

362
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,320
your house before you leave it right

363
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,120
your reactive controls are coming home

364
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,339
and your neighbor steps out and says hey

365
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,899
by the way

366
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,060
somebody came by with a van cleaned out

367
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,519
your house two hours ago but I got their

368
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,160
license plate number for you

369
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,660
well great I mean I guess I can go track

370
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,980
this down and hopefully stop that from

371
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,380
happening again but it's all after the

372
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,820
fact right the event's already taken

373
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,579
place I can Shore up my house but it's

374
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,140
too late

375
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,339
uh

376
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,380
and for a long time in the industry we

377
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,000
focused in the middle right we build

378
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,339
walls we buy tools

379
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,560
um we focus on this idea that hey if we

380
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
can just put enough defenses in place

381
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,000
the attackers can't get in or we'll slow

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,279
them down enough that will detect them

383
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,740
and then the response can kick in and

384
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,079
will stop them from doing real damage

385
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,019
but look we've seen the landscape scale

386
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,300
in a way that it really hasn't in the

387
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,940
last you know 20 or so years Cloud

388
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,800
Technologies and the and the ease of

389
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
availability of all that has changed the

390
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,820
game right we could spin up tens of

391
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,560
thousands of assets if I want to launch

392
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
an attack against somebody I can break

393
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,540
down walls pretty easily if I want to

394
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,940
and with that scalability we have to

395
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,560
kind of shift our focus on how we

396
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,660
address that because the more of those

397
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,420
attacks that we can stop up front we can

398
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,040
find the ways to close the doors and

399
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,019
lock the windows early

400
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,579
the fewer attacks are going to be

401
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,079
successful and actually reach those

402
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,180
walls and that's where we can start to

403
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,620
make them more effective

404
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,360
if you finance folks out there we'll get

405
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
a better Roi for our investment in our

406
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,440
reactive Technologies

407
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,639
all right

408
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,899
but they'll be more effective there's

409
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,639
fewer false positives they'll actually

410
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,440
stop the things and make it through and

411
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,899
then ideally even if something makes it

412
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,519
through there's only so many that make

413
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,899
it through to your response program and

414
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,459
you're not just in constant firefighting

415
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,779
mode

416
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,720
this model we're seeing everything kind

417
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,000
of shift this way nist is continues to

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,380
update the cyber security framework to

419
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,639
use this or emphasizing more

420
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,139
preventative strategies

421
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,019
we're seeing uh regulatory issues in

422
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,639
other countries hasn't quite made it

423
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,500
here yet but India Thailand have both

424
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,260
passed recently uh legislation for

425
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,800
companies that manage uh

426
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
microtransactions like phone based

427
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
applications for doing microtransactions

428
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,500
right they've passed law that says if

429
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,459
you're going to be a company that

430
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,680
handles people's finances in that way

431
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
you have to have a program that looks

432
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,220
like this with a focus on preventative

433
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,600
now

434
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,519
from a tooling standpoint obviously we

435
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,139
have a lot of things that can help us we

436
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,540
know this stuff this shouldn't become a

437
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,519
surprise but it should draw a little bit

438
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,779
of a line about what we're talking about

439
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,019
as well and what tools we have

440
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,579
um firewalls by the way for those who

441
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,380
are wondering I really personally feel

442
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,480
it belongs in the reactive category

443
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,040
some people like to argue that point I

444
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,360
put it in the middle just to avoid that

445
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,500
so if you're one of those people thinks

446
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,240
it's a preventative thing great

447
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,579
it's in the middle I've compromised yeah

448
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,279
see I'm kind of yeah I'm a reactive guy

449
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,540
when it comes to firewalls that's just

450
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,880
my thing but you appreciate thank you

451
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,519
um but the thing about this is like the

452
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,060
tools again get siled right and so as

453
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,139
I've mentioned I want to talk about

454
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,579
attack path analysis today because

455
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,320
attack path analysis

456
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,660
is a really useful tool when done right

457
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,660
and typically when we've used it in the

458
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,940
last several years we kind of do it down

459
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,079
here

460
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,899
right we see attack path analysis mostly

461
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,000
used in

462
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,860
um post-mortem events and forensic

463
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,019
analysis for a data breach we we kind of

464
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,240
look at it from the standpoint of

465
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,279
let's recreate what happened through all

466
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,899
the events and the logs and the trace

467
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,000
files and all that good fun stuff

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,639
uh and let's map out how the breach

469
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,779
happened

470
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,639
so that we can make sure it doesn't

471
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,079
happen again

472
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,339
that's a pretty good risk decision

473
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,560
making tool I like that except the

474
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,360
problem is

475
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,860
the breach has already happened right

476
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,079
the damage is done so yes we don't want

477
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,699
to have it haven't have it happen a

478
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:03,959
second time

479
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,639
but ideally we don't want it to happen

480
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,260
in the first place

481
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,500
so what I I start to propose or want

482
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,120
people to start thinking about and this

483
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,980
is just one example of many but the one

484
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,959
I'm going to talk about today is what if

485
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,880
you extend the tool to start

486
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,220
incorporating State data what if you

487
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,260
Leverage The tactics the techniques of

488
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,180
attack path analysis when you're looking

489
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,480
at State not the what's already happened

490
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,660
because if you can do that we start to

491
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,060
move more away from a forensic view of

492
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,320
this world

493
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,120
and it starts to lean more into that

494
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,680
probability and likelihood kind of world

495
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,660
more of a risk management kind of world

496
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,360
which is really where we should live

497
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,399
as I like to remind folks and I don't

498
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,199
think anyone here is going to shake

499
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,459
their head at this

500
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll probably just set that up

501
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,380
um you know security functions today in

502
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,240
an organization we're not an I.T

503
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
function we're a risk management

504
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,680
function for organizations we have to be

505
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,300
strong technologists don't get me wrong

506
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,040
because that's where the data lives

507
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,319
that's where the assets live but we are

508
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,299
a risk management we are there to

509
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,980
identify the problems and help protect

510
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,599
that organization before it goes bad

511
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,540
that's more aligned to finance and legal

512
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,760
and even HR

513
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,500
I've given another talk about how to

514
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,640
talk with those folks but that's a

515
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,839
different story anyway

516
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,819
but if we can extend out here to state

517
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,579
right I can start to use this kind of

518
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,939
Tooling in a way that lets me identify

519
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,620
where risk might live in my organization

520
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,600
make better decisions about where I

521
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,880
should start where I should focus where

522
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
we want to look instead of trying to

523
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,720
scramble at it right

524
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,419
so for those of you not not familiar

525
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,700
it's been around a fairly long time this

526
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,620
is an example from Microsoft on Exchange

527
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,320
attack it's a visualization right if

528
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
you're not if you haven't seen it I'd be

529
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,039
surprised if anyone here hasn't but if

530
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,020
you haven't it's a visualization of how

531
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,039
an attacker moves through the

532
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,360
organization what vulnerabilities were

533
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,980
exploited misconfigurations all that

534
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,900
good fun stuff it's a nice way to lay

535
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,020
out the path they took to get to the

536
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,900
crown jewels whatever the thing might be

537
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,260
so but this is all again post

538
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,880
this is all based on events that have

539
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,020
happened already

540
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,480
let's talk about what it would look like

541
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,700
from a state perspective I'll walk you

542
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,860
through a really simple example

543
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,960
um and hap and I'd like to have some uh

544
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
some interaction here in a few minutes

545
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,679
just don't get snarky I know how this is

546
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,880
going to go

547
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
all right

548
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
so let's talk about a potential

549
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,500
hypothetical attack path right if we're

550
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
doing our work to assess the state we

551
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,740
kind of know what the state of our

552
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,059
environment looks like

553
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,980
we know that we probably have some users

554
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,120
out there who are still working from

555
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,980
home we've given them a laptop

556
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,020
and great they're doing work for us out

557
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,520
there

558
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,799
there's two things we know about users

559
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,620
in every organization worldwide

560
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,480
they're not terribly Vigilant when it

561
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,000
comes to security matters

562
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,340
and they're really really good at

563
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,780
hitting the snooze button on our patch

564
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,240
management tools

565
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
and the problem with that is the

566
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,140
attackers know that too

567
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,660
now look the last three years I'm not

568
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,160
going to Regale you with stats we know

569
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,960
that we've seen a massive increase in

570
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
phishing attacks and other targeted

571
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,980
attacks at home users their networks

572
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,480
aren't as well protected they're easy

573
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
targets or soft targets we know that's

574
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,039
been happening right so look if I'm an

575
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,360
attacker I'm going to go after those

576
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,220
things they're easy

577
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,140
if I'm a Defender though I may have done

578
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,940
my due diligence maybe I've scanned it

579
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,380
or maybe I have an agent on it or

580
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,940
something I've done some amount of

581
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,980
vulnerability analysis and hey look at

582
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,140
that in fact good old Joe did hit the

583
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,520
snooze button

584
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,440
and it is missing some patches one of

585
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,720
which would solve a cve that's known for

586
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
being exploited by ransomware command

587
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,140
and control and a few other nasty things

588
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,419
that lets an attacker take over the Box

589
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,100
all right so that's one piece of data

590
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,020
I've done some security work but we

591
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,039
should go patch that probably but

592
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,600
whatever

593
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,039
but let's walk through the attack path

594
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,900
if I'm the attacker and I get on that

595
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,240
box and I own it

596
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,860
I also own Joe and everything he

597
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,559
accesses right so what does Joe know

598
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,760
like well I'm not going to sit there and

599
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,340
just scan for that single vulnerability

600
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,080
and get bored as an attacker when I

601
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,940
don't find it anywhere else remember

602
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,100
I'll pivot I don't care so I'm gonna go

603
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,480
and say hey what kind of access do I

604
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,700
have oh Joe's part of a user group that

605
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,080
gives him access into a corporate

606
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,820
environment and takes him to the server

607
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,559
inside the corporate environment that

608
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,380
happens to house an incredibly critical

609
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,940
business server like it's the thing that

610
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,860
runs your whole company probably has

611
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,539
been there 12 years

612
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,760
no one remembers how the code is written

613
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,039
or whatnot and but every employee uses

614
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,660
it all your customers use it it's it's

615
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,299
the thing that makes it all work right

616
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,440
Joe's got to access that to get his job

617
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,220
done

618
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,440
but I'm the attacker I'm there now

619
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,799
a 12 year old application sweet because

620
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
12 years ago I know developers are

621
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,360
really good at secure coding practices

622
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,660
and uh they would never leave hard-coded

623
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,179
credentials in the code in the clear to

624
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,679
access back-end databases that would

625
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,360
never happen

626
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,380
um

627
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,299
I hope that coughing is because like we

628
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,179
know it's a joke right I'm covering for

629
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,580
you try it so great there's a service

630
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,740
account sitting there in the clear

631
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,419
cool now I have an admin thing let's

632
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,620
take that let's do some privilege

633
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,360
escalation because that's really the

634
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,740
goal if I can do it

635
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,740
you become domain domain admin now I win

636
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,940
right

637
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,440
now look this is a very simple attack

638
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,360
path couple different points of data

639
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,980
I've done some active directory analysis

640
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,140
I've done some endpoint analysis I've

641
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,520
looked a little bit of configuration or

642
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,559
code analysis

643
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,140
but again if we're trying to make

644
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,820
decisions about mitigating risk the

645
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,440
question becomes

646
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,299
where do you start

647
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,159
so that's the question to ask you

648
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,620
simple let's just stay simple

649
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,640
because I know some of you are going to

650
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
come with really clever answers this but

651
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,700
let's stay simple

652
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
if you were going to try to solve this

653
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,740
prevent it from happening prevent this

654
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,260
attack path from taking place

655
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,020
what's the first thing you do

656
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,500
please

657
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,740
[Music]

658
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,020
I love that so either train Joe to do

659
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,880
better or make sure the technology

660
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,260
doesn't give him the opportunity to

661
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,480
subvert it right or both

662
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,460
I'm good with both of those

663
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,260
um I'm a big fan of training I'm a big

664
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,059
fan of that I'll just say really quick

665
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,679
um I mean I'd come for more of the

666
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:17,940
people's side of security these days so

667
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,039
I'm a big fan of training uh so yes

668
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,620
absolutely train Joe we should do that

669
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,880
however

670
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,740
um have you met humans before

671
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,120
[Music]

672
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,539
like so you enter yeah so we know that

673
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,700
not all of them even after training stop

674
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,020
clicking on the links that they

675
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,140
shouldn't uh and yes not subverting the

676
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,480
the stuff is a really good plan but we

677
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,640
also know that patching tools have

678
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,919
delays when those things check in or

679
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,240
don't check in there's some there's

680
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,220
stuff and if it's not Joe I'll get Jane

681
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,620
or you know Jeff or Mary I'll get I'll

682
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,179
find one of them and that's an easy

683
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,980
exploit too so we should do those things

684
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,480
but I can get around that

685
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,740
yeah at least Pro yeah I'm a big fan of

686
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,900
least privilege

687
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,140
foreign

688
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,880
sure but he he's only a member of a

689
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,020
remote user group that is the least

690
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,840
privilege he can have

691
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,230
[Music]

692
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,100
well that's the application they have to

693
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,840
use to work if they don't have that work

694
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,158
why did I hire Joe to do work

695
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,380
if I can access that app if I can't if I

696
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,600
can access it as an attacker I can I can

697
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,880
I can attack it and Joe's got to access

698
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,799
that thing to work so we have to give

699
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,240
him some amount of access if I give him

700
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,220
none that would protect the server but

701
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,419
then why do I have an employee

702
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,260
I understand but he's got to have some

703
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,880
amount right which means the attacker

704
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,340
once compromised will have some amount

705
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,679
what's that

706
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,780
yeah in this example you'll consider

707
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,039
that lease because that's we didn't make

708
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,000
him an admin or anything they would just

709
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,470
give them the basic rights to get there

710
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,039
[Music]

711
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,659
in what would Asset Management do for us

712
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,780
here

713
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,380
we know it's old yeah we already know

714
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,260
that part is old so

715
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,419
um I'll give you one on that one we

716
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,740
might say like maybe we should update

717
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,659
that application right something a

718
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,480
little newer that is not using Code that

719
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,000
has credentials stored in the clear uh I

720
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,260
I have a privileged access management

721
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,360
background as well I'm a big fan of not

722
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,039
letting credentials like that be out in

723
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,020
the clear but remember this is a 12 year

724
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,039
old application that runs the whole

725
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,659
business

726
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,980
do we have the devs we still remember

727
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,900
how to do it do we have a finance

728
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,280
officer that's willing to let us take us

729
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,500
down for a period of time or spend the

730
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,419
money to build a new one the business

731
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,340
may become an obstacle here and not let

732
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,380
us do it because the impact of either

733
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,960
interrupting the work or taking it down

734
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,159
to patch

735
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,200
they may not allow it because of Revenue

736
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,720
issues which is real right one more

737
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,100
[Music]

738
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,280
right

739
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,460
I and I totally agree but like I said in

740
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,720
this business example you might have the

741
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,820
challenges you can't right

742
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,919
you do

743
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,360
and I'm about to I'm about to get there

744
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,980
with you you're you're half step ahead

745
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,799
of me but you get there so you all see

746
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,940
what we're talking about here right

747
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,400
there's a lot of ways to address this we

748
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,740
we could talk about do we put a WAFF in

749
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,760
front of that thing and maybe filter

750
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,140
traffic except that we still have access

751
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,760
control things we have to deal with that

752
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,620
do we you know

753
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,960
um do we try to address the domain admin

754
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,640
elevation thing is there is a reason

755
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,980
that that service account is even an

756
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,720
admin account at all we don't know what

757
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,279
else is attached to we might not we

758
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,140
might break other things there's a lot

759
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,880
of places where we could inject security

760
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,940
controls here but even with very smart

761
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,799
people in the room you've seen what's

762
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,720
happened here

763
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
we still don't know where to start

764
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,500
right

765
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,419
well I'm going to carry on if you don't

766
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,940
mind thank you so that's part of the

767
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,799
problem right you might be able to

768
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,120
figure this out with a lot of work for

769
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,500
your particular environment but it's not

770
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,880
obvious and we're going to spend a lot

771
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,320
of time chasing this to try to figure

772
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,279
out

773
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,100
what the right thing to do is

774
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,260
let me add some more context more data

775
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,820
if we can relate more information it

776
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,140
might become a little clearer right so

777
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,700
let's say I have done some configuration

778
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,720
work

779
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,580
and I also know that that server in the

780
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
middle that's the obvious kind of

781
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,480
problem or seeming to be obvious also

782
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,760
has a VPN service running on it that is

783
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,400
misconfigured to allow access without

784
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,080
MFA

785
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,260
bad really bad uh and especially since I

786
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,820
got those store credentials that let me

787
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,559
be admin that no one's paying attention

788
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,840
to because it's a non-human account

789
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,799
brilliant I could go anywhere I want

790
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,600
let's go down the tunnel what's down the

791
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
tunnel some sort of critical area of

792
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,940
your network could be your if you're a

793
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,380
power company could be your OT network

794
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,260
if you're Finance of your PCI network

795
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,480
whatever's critical to you right so you

796
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,980
now I'm down here and I've got access to

797
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,659
this whole thing and of course let's

798
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,100
just use for example it is a power

799
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,120
company

800
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,980
uh any of you have worked in that space

801
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,080
you know aside from all that specialty

802
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,820
equipment there are ancient windows and

803
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,559
Linux boxes that the engineers and

804
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,200
controllers use in in those places and

805
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,419
they almost never get patched because

806
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,400
we air gap

807
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,039
except well we have a VPN there because

808
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,240
those employees that work in that

809
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,500
Network have to get back to that early

810
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
critical application to do their work so

811
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,640
now I have two attack pads that come out

812
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,720
of that thing

813
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,179
and it could be 20 it could be 200 it

814
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,980
could be a lot more than that

815
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,440
and while it's not necessarily obvious

816
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,419
at least what this starts to do is it

817
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,940
starts to point a finger at maybe this

818
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,220
is the place we should focus because if

819
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,320
I can solve the problem here

820
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,539
then I cut off the potential for access

821
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,179
to the domain admin elevation to that OT

822
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,940
Network to a lot of other potential

823
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,460
damage and harm that could be done

824
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,559
now we're not answering the question of

825
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,020
how

826
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,779
so to your point build a case you might

827
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,580
have to like do I need more budget

828
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,320
what's the right tooling do we need more

829
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,120
people do we need to write a new code

830
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,679
whatever whatever the answer is for your

831
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,380
organization this is the next step

832
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,240
but you can't have that conversation

833
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,740
with your team to figure out the plan

834
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,659
until you know where you want to start

835
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,539
right well that's true too

836
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,299
arguably for let's just say for fun it's

837
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,100
super critical and we should fix it

838
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,679
right so this is a simple example but

839
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,760
you get what we're talking about here

840
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,039
right if I can build an understanding of

841
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,360
the state of the environment if I can

842
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
relate these things together

843
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,580
I can start to look at this kind of like

844
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,380
likelihood of how risk flows through my

845
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,279
environment

846
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,260
and you can see how if you did this for

847
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,779
the entire organization you're going to

848
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,120
have a massive map but what will come

849
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,640
out of it are these choke points

850
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,100
and one thing I will tell you is this

851
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,080
you talk to a CFO to try to get budget

852
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,840
for that fixing the problem

853
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,279
I wouldn't necessarily show them

854
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,840
something like this

855
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,640
but I have done exercises where I've

856
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,620
done this and Stripped Away the text

857
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,600
and just told them like look

858
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,020
I have mapped out how risk flows through

859
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,080
this organization and where it is most

860
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,059
likely to impact us financially

861
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,919
CFOs understand that statement and they

862
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,299
look at it and they go well how come

863
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:25,559
there's all these lines coming out of

864
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,960
this one little Dot

865
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,820
I'm glad you asked that

866
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,200
it's the application we've been talking

867
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
about that's the thing we're going to

868
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
have to resolve because that's the thing

869
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,720
that leads to all this risk

870
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,399
that visualization can be really

871
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,659
powerful for people who don't really

872
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,159
understand what's going on it doesn't

873
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,740
work for everyone but it can be

874
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,919
but for us if I can get to this point in

875
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,059
a minute

876
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,340
rather than weeks of analysis work with

877
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,440
spreadsheets and everything else

878
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,360
I'm way ahead of the game

879
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,220
and we still might decide not to start

880
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,539
here this might be too much of a

881
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:58,799
challenge to overcome I've been in those

882
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,179
kinds of organizations where like you

883
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,520
just can't touch it

884
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,380
okay let's start talking about patchina

885
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,880
what's the next thing we can do right

886
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,220
but this gives us a place to say this is

887
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,419
where I can start

888
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,399
this is a really important way we change

889
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,260
the way we use the tool we already have

890
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,260
but base it on that state data

891
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,059
so that we can understand risk better in

892
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,799
the environment get to that point of

893
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,899
answering where to start

894
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,880
make sense

895
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,220
any questions any thoughts before I move

896
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,799
to the communication part

897
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,380
which I still have time for it's great

898
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,679
[Music]

899
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,539
perfect okay

900
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,200
all right in the back

901
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,659
sure so

902
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,960
which answer do I give you

903
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,700
my marketing team would tell you it's

904
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,440
tenable

905
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,460
um

906
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,340
you know I look realistically what we're

907
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,899
talking about if we go further back like

908
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,940
it's about doing assessment work right

909
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,760
so we need to be able to understand that

910
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,620
security state that is having some kind

911
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,940
of vulnerability scanning that's about

912
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,620
having web application scanning some

913
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,860
tasks or you know a SAS is both ideally

914
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,559
you want to have you know for your Cloud

915
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,120
environments you should have some ways

916
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,200
to look at you do your posture

917
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,460
management assessment understand your

918
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,140
configurations make sure that things are

919
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,820
the way they are

920
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,799
um there is a tooling requirement for

921
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,620
all of that assessment work right once

922
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,179
you have that

923
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,460
I mean look we've been aggregating that

924
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,679
stuff for years manually right I mean

925
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,960
every single one of us uses the most

926
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,399
widely used security tool on the planet

927
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,899
right

928
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,340
anyone

929
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,600
thank you

930
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,340
Microsoft Excel is most widely used

931
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,860
security tool on the planet period

932
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,918
um

933
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,659
kind of worked for a long time there are

934
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,640
tools and ways to do it and today I'm

935
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,600
not going to be I'm not going to stand

936
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,399
up here and try to tell you some of them

937
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,140
in some regards I don't want to go down

938
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,480
that road but there's definitely ways to

939
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,860
automate that process and there's a lot

940
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,120
of different ways to do it I mean I've

941
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,100
seen folks do this manually I've worked

942
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,539
with organizations that have built risk

943
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,340
systems out to try to aggregate this and

944
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,580
build the relationship mapping

945
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,000
some folks do it on miter uh that's a

946
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,440
lot of post attack and technique work

947
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,700
which doesn't always align with business

948
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,520
so well so there's some some rub there

949
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,140
there's definitely ways to do it it's

950
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,940
not a hopeless cause and I and have

951
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,100
definitely seen it in practice so it can

952
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,799
be done but it really needs a focus on

953
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,960
are we doing enough assessment to have

954
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,940
that state data so that it can build

955
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,799
those relationships

956
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,820
good

957
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,440
all right

958
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,140
so look let's talk about communication

959
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,460
if we're making these good decisions

960
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,080
about how to mitigate risk or where to

961
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,980
start

962
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,539
we also have to be able to talk to

963
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,460
people about risk and we need to be able

964
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,440
to explain to them in ways that they

965
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,480
understand

966
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,039
so that we can all get on the same page

967
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,600
we can get aligned

968
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,960
oftentimes though we use a lot of words

969
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,700
in security that do not mean the same

970
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,640
thing to the people we talk to

971
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
all right you think about words like

972
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,200
asset and risk and all of this

973
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,960
we use them kind of differently and that

974
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
becomes a problem and whether we like it

975
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,120
or not

976
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,019
for all of the rhetoric of the last 20

977
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,659
years of infosec what do organs or

978
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,640
organizations say

979
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,260
Securities at the heart of everything we

980
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:28,980
do

981
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,960
security is the thread that's woven

982
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,299
through the organization every one of us

983
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,039
is a security person we're all in it

984
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,019
together right

985
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:41,220
we are as security folks really at the

986
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,860
center of communication for

987
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,220
organizations because think about it

988
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,960
legal is going to come to us and ask us

989
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,820
about compliance stuff and legal like

990
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,760
rbgdpr compliant I gotta talk legally

991
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,100
with the general counsel and finance is

992
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,600
going to come to us and say what's the

993
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,860
ROI and all this stuff that you've been

994
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,940
buying and should we give you more

995
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,380
budget and they're going to want to hear

996
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,140
it and the business wants to understand

997
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,399
hey we didn't have a data breach this

998
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,419
year that means we don't need you guys

999
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,280
anymore right

1000
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,859
like we talk to all these different

1001
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,599
groups and they have different requests

1002
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,339
from us

1003
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,379
but we don't always talk back to them in

1004
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,379
a way that's that they understand so one

1005
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,760
of the things we have to do is focus on

1006
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,800
not just the words we use but

1007
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
understanding that they mean different

1008
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,219
things to different people

1009
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,679
Let's do an exercise simply put

1010
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,040
when you see this word

1011
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,800
[Music]

1012
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,179
what's the first thing you think of

1013
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,540
what's the first object you think of

1014
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,280
a lizard

1015
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,500
that's pretty good I like that

1016
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,719
that's pretty good anyone else

1017
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,580
a screen thank you that's the obvious

1018
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,500
one right we live on these things we sit

1019
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,199
here all day like I think of a screen

1020
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,520
um and I think anyone in technology

1021
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,580
other than the weirdos in the back

1022
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,719
well I'm going to talk about the word in

1023
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,540
the back in a second hold on but

1024
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,060
yeah screens duh

1025
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,560
except if I go and talk to someone in

1026
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,820
healthcare

1027
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,260
and I tell them that what about a

1028
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,099
monitor they're going to give me

1029
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:06,119
something like a heart monitor or an

1030
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,580
oxygen monitor or an IV pump monitor or

1031
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,720
something like that because that's where

1032
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,760
they live and if you're like the person

1033
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,140
in the back or a very dear friend of

1034
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,700
mine I I'm gonna lead to this you just

1035
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,200
jumped right ahead of me here

1036
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,240
I I have a very dear friend who collects

1037
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,800
exotic pets and absolutely do collect

1038
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,300
lizards and if you say monitor they will

1039
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,980
tell you all about how Komodo dragons

1040
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,260
are part of the monitor lizard family in

1041
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,940
extensive detail

1042
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,560
right

1043
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,660
and you know if you're somebody like me

1044
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,980
who

1045
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,480
struggled in high school a little bit

1046
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,520
got bullied a lot and you know made

1047
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,720
friends with teachers so that I could

1048
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,579
get out of class A lot

1049
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,260
um when I think of monitor I usually end

1050
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,420
up with this guy

1051
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,680
um

1052
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,900
the irony is of when this episode came

1053
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,940
out that was what my home on her kind of

1054
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,099
looked like so it was really the beard

1055
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:55,260
the whole thing it was not good

1056
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,579
um

1057
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,380
make the point

1058
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,720
one word four meetings depending on the

1059
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,760
audience you're talking to and as

1060
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,040
security folks we need to take the

1061
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,140
responsibility to understand this

1062
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,359
and pivot the conversation in a way that

1063
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,560
makes sense to the folks we're talking

1064
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,460
to

1065
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,859
that may mean education

1066
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,359
that might mean that we don't just

1067
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,700
assume when I go to the finance officer

1068
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,980
and I say hey this system is putting us

1069
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,140
at risk that he knows what I'm talking

1070
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,099
about

1071
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,540
I need to be able to go that a finance

1072
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,099
officer and say

1073
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:30,000
this this server this object puts us at

1074
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,220
risk of a financial loss of 10 million

1075
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,079
dollars per day

1076
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,880
I need to take on that responsibility we

1077
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,900
need to take on that responsibility

1078
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,060
that's the language they understand

1079
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,339
so remember the words we use don't

1080
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,079
always mean the same thing we need to

1081
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:44,579
clear that up

1082
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,359
sure quick

1083
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,220
that is true I was focusing on nouns

1084
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,380
let's talk about normalization and

1085
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,760
context then right because part of what

1086
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,960
we're trying to do here with language is

1087
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,940
normalize what we say make sure that the

1088
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,160
context is has a a good understanding

1089
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,079
and to your point in the back about the

1090
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,060
aggregation of the data this is one of

1091
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,619
the places where we have to focus if we

1092
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,300
want to do that because when we talk

1093
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,880
about security risk

1094
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,310
all the different types of

1095
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,520
[Music]

1096
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,740
vulnerabilities or however you want to

1097
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,119
think of that missing patch

1098
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,520
misconfiguration code flaw whatever it's

1099
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,820
all it's all a weakness all of it

1100
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,680
we already in the industry we have a

1101
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,119
hard time talking about those things in

1102
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,400
context with each other right we have

1103
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
different scoring systems we have

1104
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,359
different ways of talking about it and

1105
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,800
even this stuff we get kind of confused

1106
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,359
about and what it ends up happening is

1107
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,380
we have to start asking ourselves

1108
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,240
questions like well geez jeez you know

1109
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,280
I've got this thing that's like a you

1110
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
know what is it what I put up here 7.6

1111
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
there we go CBS S7

1112
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,220
but I also have a web flaw that's a high

1113
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,960
and I'm failing on this other thing

1114
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,300
which one's worse

1115
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,520
well there's no context really there and

1116
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,900
the only way we do that is to have the

1117
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,579
analyst in the middle who's been there

1118
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,320
for 10 years who knows what all those

1119
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,300
things are who has a dozen spreadsheets

1120
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
sitting in front of them and is going to

1121
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
do that work for 20 or 30 hours ago well

1122
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,000
actually

1123
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I know that laptop that has the 7.6 it's

1124
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,119
the CEO's laptop and it's bad all right

1125
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,980
this is something that we have to start

1126
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,079
to work against too

1127
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,940
um again there are techniques for doing

1128
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,520
this

1129
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,020
uh but this is what we need to start

1130
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,700
doing is figuring out ways where we can

1131
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,859
normalize this information normalize the

1132
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,200
data set so that when I talk about this

1133
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,300
stuff to people

1134
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,880
we at least come from a a unified

1135
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,160
platform right I can talk about a high

1136
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,180
risk

1137
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,119
across the board or I talk about an 8.3

1138
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,339
risk across the board like whatever

1139
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,780
system you want to use I don't really

1140
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,400
care

1141
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,020
but find the one that works and try to

1142
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,520
normalize that information because then

1143
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,260
it gives us context for us to do the

1144
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,880
rest of the work

1145
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,640
now some of that work is also in the way

1146
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,220
we how we not just look at the findings

1147
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,460
and understand risk in context but it's

1148
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,020
also the way we report it to everyone

1149
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,280
else

1150
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,260
and this is where I find

1151
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,359
probably the biggest challenge for

1152
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:07,800
security folks

1153
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,599
is here

1154
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,280
because

1155
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,440
we have all these tools

1156
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,940
the tools are really good at generating

1157
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,800
data

1158
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,460
those data points go into spreadsheets

1159
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,320
and those spreadsheets tally up to

1160
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,700
really big numbers

1161
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,680
and we love those big numbers we're very

1162
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,839
proud of our big numbers and we love to

1163
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,060
tell people all the time oh yeah I

1164
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,680
stopped 93 000 probe attempts on the

1165
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,820
perimeter today

1166
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,740
our Ops Team deployed 12 and a half

1167
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,480
thousand patches last month

1168
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,079
yep I found 75 000 vulnerabilities fixed

1169
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,760
well it sounds great to us because we

1170
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,680
live in that world

1171
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,160
but

1172
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,560
that same first job when I was a CSO I

1173
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,180
mentioned

1174
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,160
um I learned a lot in that jobs why I

1175
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,380
talk about it a lot but

1176
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,300
I had this problem we came on board they

1177
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
have really no security team

1178
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,140
um well no security program they had

1179
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,940
five people but they weren't organized

1180
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,220
and I was told by the CEO just just go

1181
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,099
fix it just go make it work

1182
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,839
all right

1183
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,980
um

1184
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,440
try to do some code review the CTO of

1185
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
the company just told me Point Blank

1186
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,560
like you will never your team will never

1187
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,940
touch any of my Dev systems go away

1188
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
all right well I have to go work on that

1189
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,760
but I need to do something today so we

1190
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,380
went low-hanging fruit like we went for

1191
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,420
a patching exercise it's the obvious you

1192
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,680
know kind of thing

1193
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,839
told the team just go patch whatever you

1194
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:32,579
need to patch reboot whatever you need

1195
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,960
to reboot I will deal with Fallout

1196
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,940
that's my job now let's just get it done

1197
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,520
so we did a 30-day Sprint

1198
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,220
do as much as we could possibly do

1199
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,380
did an assessment did the prioritization

1200
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,119
we did our work right we started the

1201
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,920
month with about 300 000 open

1202
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,500
vulnerabilities just in our like server

1203
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,260
data centers work workstations just

1204
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,140
typical Windows Linux kind of stuff

1205
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,780
team in that 30-day period we we fixed

1206
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,579
and remediated about a hundred thousand

1207
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:00,720
a little over a hundred thousand of them

1208
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,119
mostly in the high in critical ranges so

1209
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,820
we're pretty stoked like

1210
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,619
that's a lot of work to get done even if

1211
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:09,359
you're only deploying some patches 100

1212
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,740
000 bombs out of the environment 30 days

1213
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,480
it's no joke

1214
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,740
and

1215
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,420
I wanted to make sure my team got credit

1216
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,400
for it so I went to the board that next

1217
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
month I had my PowerPoint presentations

1218
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,700
all ready to go I had my graphs and

1219
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,339
charts and colors and all the good stuff

1220
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,400
and I was like hey check it out

1221
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,500
300 000 at the top

1222
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,480
killed a hundred thousand of them off 34

1223
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,820
reduction in Risk High critical stuff

1224
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,820
awesome

1225
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,760
my general counsel looked across the

1226
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,800
table for me and said

1227
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
so what you only did one third of your

1228
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,959
job

1229
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,540
and yeah you had 300 000 problems

1230
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,180
there's still 200 000 problems left you

1231
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,599
suck at your job we need a new CSO

1232
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,579
they didn't fire me for what it's worth

1233
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,320
I got to stick around but

1234
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,560
you see my point right volume based

1235
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,079
metrics while we love our data they're

1236
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,780
really good for workload right if I'm

1237
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,339
trying to understand how much work needs

1238
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,020
to be done that's fine

1239
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,880
it is not the right thing when we're

1240
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,280
talking about risk to a business to

1241
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,859
finance folks to the board to other even

1242
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,839
peers in the organization who are at the

1243
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,680
board level this is not their world

1244
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,599
we have to find the ways to make this

1245
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,060
work now that could mean a lot of

1246
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,200
different things

1247
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,480
percentages trends

1248
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,280
letter grades whatever I'm going to show

1249
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,480
you an example here in a moment it

1250
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,220
doesn't matter what it is but find

1251
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,900
something that appeals it's simple it's

1252
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,000
easy it's intuitive so that someone who

1253
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,380
doesn't live in our world can look at it

1254
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,359
and go oh the lines moving in the right

1255
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,099
direction cool

1256
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:52,079
that's what you want

1257
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,240
we often laugh about stoplight Graphics

1258
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,000
right stoplight colors we all I see a

1259
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,200
lot of people nodding like we all make

1260
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,180
fun already because because c-suite

1261
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,319
executives are stupid right

1262
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,400
look these people are making hundreds of

1263
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,900
decisions on a given day

1264
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,359
all they really want to know is are we

1265
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,560
okay

1266
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,079
or are we not

1267
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,760
red yellow Green's a pretty simple way

1268
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,160
an intuitive way to show that we laugh

1269
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,099
it's a good way to show that information

1270
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,460
are we good green cool what else do you

1271
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,599
need nothing let's move on to the next

1272
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,940
thing are we bad why what do we need to

1273
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,600
do to fix it simple

1274
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,000
[Music]

1275
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,560
we need to move that direction when we

1276
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,599
talk to other folks outside of our kind

1277
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,060
of outside of our sphere so let me show

1278
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,200
you an example what it might look like

1279
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm going to qualify this very heavily

1280
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
I work for a company we do some of this

1281
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,339
stuff

1282
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,560
it's the tools I have access to

1283
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,440
all right so little fair warning I

1284
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,240
understand how that looks but

1285
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,980
I'll emphasize again you can do this a

1286
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,599
million different ways

1287
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,280
just once you share the example are we

1288
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,839
good is everyone all right with that

1289
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,819
mostly all right I'm gonna get heckled

1290
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,240
later for this I know all right so look

1291
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,160
letter grade it's not the end of the

1292
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,900
world right I don't have to understand

1293
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,240
75 000 vulnerabilities remediated or

1294
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,339
need to be remediated to know that c is

1295
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,260
pretty average so I'm going to be asking

1296
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,460
the security team what do we need to do

1297
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,319
to get that to a b

1298
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,119
I don't know what it takes that's your

1299
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,560
job that's why we that's why I hired you

1300
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,000
and the security team go solve that

1301
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,119
right color coding is great too because

1302
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,560
I can look at that very simply and go

1303
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,180
wow there's two in the bottom or red

1304
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,680
like United Federation of planets like

1305
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,300
what are they not doing any work or

1306
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,740
what's going on over there

1307
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,900
yeah like let's go talk to them and

1308
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,460
figure out why are they not patching or

1309
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,079
what's like now I have Focus I can

1310
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,760
literally see where I need to focus

1311
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,839
right

1312
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,940
we're not talking volume we're not even

1313
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,280
necessarily talking about what

1314
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,140
but at the business level I can I can

1315
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,460
kind of intuitively understand what's

1316
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,140
going on here and as you talk to the

1317
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,540
organizations about this is how risk

1318
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,520
maps in our organization this is who's

1319
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,440
contributing the most potential

1320
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,720
Financial loss to the organization

1321
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,599
this starts to translate a lot into the

1322
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,760
business World it makes it easier for

1323
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,500
them to wrap their brains around how

1324
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,079
this technology stuff

1325
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,000
can put the organization at risk and

1326
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,440
where it's happening

1327
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,000
right

1328
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
use LINE charts use whatever you need to

1329
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,260
do right but you kind of see what I'm

1330
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,060
saying here I hope you see what I'm

1331
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,339
saying here this kind of simplistic

1332
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,460
thing lets them be very quick and it's

1333
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,140
intuitive I don't have to educate them a

1334
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,700
lot I don't have to explain what a

1335
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,579
vulnerability is or why one cve is worse

1336
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,980
than another uh we don't talk about that

1337
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,780
that's not their world this is their

1338
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,619
world

1339
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,619
and the more we can do this the better

1340
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,099
please

1341
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,339
it's a great it's a good question we

1342
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,200
felt that the Klingons in their very

1343
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,540
very strict sort of structured society

1344
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,460
would have enforced that they wouldn't

1345
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,780
give the option to snooze they would

1346
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,859
have turned off the patch management

1347
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,619
stuff and forced that issue where I

1348
00:45:58,619 --> 00:45:59,700
think the Federation would have trusted

1349
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,440
a little bit more that everyone would do

1350
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,640
the right thing at the right time the

1351
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,680
right way so that leaves a little bit of

1352
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,940
a little bit of wiggle room

1353
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,220
right right I mean there's there is

1354
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,140
different incentive for end users to to

1355
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,300
patch right

1356
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,260
just saying so yeah I know but I'm gonna

1357
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,060
hold of that I think that's true I like

1358
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,260
the beheading I'm gonna I'm gonna use

1359
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,220
that one next time by the way that's

1360
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,040
really good because patch or beheading

1361
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,160
I bet you it only takes one or two and

1362
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,780
then everyone Patches from that point

1363
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,339
forward forever

1364
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,260
so

1365
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,880
I think maybe we need to do that I like

1366
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,260
this we'll have to we'll have to start a

1367
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,700
business

1368
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,079
um oh my God it's gonna be like the best

1369
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,900
consulting firm ever like you let us

1370
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,940
murder two employees I guarantee you 100

1371
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,619
compliance in all your patching

1372
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,599
I love that thank you

1373
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,859
all right

1374
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:54,359
good everybody kind of understand what

1375
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,339
I'm talking about here right

1376
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:59,160
we are risk management folks that's our

1377
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,619
function so we need to start speaking in

1378
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,000
a language that other risk management

1379
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,240
folks understand simplify it normalize

1380
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,040
the information help them understand

1381
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,260
where it's going wrong and help them

1382
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,940
understand where it's going right

1383
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,079
I'm going to tell you one quick story

1384
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,240
for the takeaways about this

1385
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,400
I worked with a company several years

1386
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,520
ago big finance company for automaker

1387
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,839
they are essentially the company that

1388
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,119
loans out when you buy a car

1389
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,339
they have about a hundred and

1390
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,460
115 of these Banks across the world one

1391
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,720
for every country they do business in

1392
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,920
and they all have their own security

1393
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,480
team they're an I.T team they all report

1394
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,060
up to the global office now in Plano

1395
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,680
I'll let you figure out who it is it's

1396
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,540
not hard

1397
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,160
um but I got brought in because this

1398
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,540
they actually had a program like this

1399
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,520
they had nice color coding they had all

1400
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,960
the stuff there they had ways to manage

1401
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,300
the slas and all that good fun stuff and

1402
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,800
they were like look we we have some

1403
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,020
countries that we just cannot get on

1404
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,760
board and we need help

1405
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,380
and this is when I got brought in to

1406
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,240
help them figure it out

1407
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,619
and we're going down the list I was like

1408
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,700
yeah help me show me what's going on

1409
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,800
they said well look look at Germany here

1410
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,380
our SLA for patching is 30 days

1411
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,780
they're on average compliant rate is 68

1412
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,640
days they're terrible we can't get them

1413
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,040
to patch for anything for nothing

1414
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,560
okay what else they're all France France

1415
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,780
is just as bad 66 days because we ask

1416
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,339
them we tell them to patch they never

1417
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,440
patch they're the worst

1418
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,780
okay well look

1419
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,280
this is good we found the anomalies in

1420
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,240
the pattern right this is what we're

1421
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,099
good at we find we find anomalies in the

1422
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,780
pattern bad you guys are the worst

1423
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,760
outliers terrible

1424
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,859
I asked the deputy CSO in the CSO this

1425
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,420
company I said well tell me what's going

1426
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,079
on in Argentina

1427
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,740
and he looked at me like I was crazy and

1428
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,400
they said what are you talking about

1429
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,460
Argentina Argentina is great their SLA

1430
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,400
compliance is nine days we never have to

1431
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,960
worry about them they kill it they patch

1432
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,660
it they do it every single time

1433
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,520
I said right

1434
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,619
why

1435
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,480
they never asked a question they never

1436
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,339
once asked them

1437
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:57,839
that's a good outlier what are those

1438
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:58,980
guys doing differently than everyone

1439
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,480
else is doing

1440
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,700
to do a nine-day SLA on a 30-day

1441
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,040
requirement so we called them up I got

1442
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,000
him on the phone like what are you guys

1443
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,560
doing they're like oh you need to talk

1444
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,359
to this guy on our team

1445
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,800
it's a little while ago mind you and

1446
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,180
he's like got him on the line he's like

1447
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,099
oh I'm a I'm a Powershell I'm a

1448
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,359
Powershell guy

1449
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,099
I just got bored

1450
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:18,599
wrote a couple Powershell scripts I

1451
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,339
brought one that grabs the patch and

1452
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,140
deploys into my test lab

1453
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,359
and let that burn for 24 hours

1454
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,560
and then I had to wrote another script

1455
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,420
to grab the patch and deploy it to my

1456
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,280
pilot Group which is like 10 of us that

1457
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,980
I trust that work in the business and I

1458
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,140
let that burn for 24 hours

1459
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,420
and then uh and then let it sit for

1460
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,920
about a week and if none of the

1461
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,599
applications break after that I have a

1462
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,680
third script and I just push it out to

1463
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,578
everything and we're done

1464
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,440
24 hours 24 hours

1465
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,280
seven days

1466
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,800
there's your nine-day SLA right

1467
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,359
so

1468
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,339
I actually thought can

1469
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,280
could we have a copy of your scripts

1470
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,079
yeah we don't care right hand it at the

1471
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,819
scripts that was it

1472
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:04,680
so we went and talked to these folks

1473
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,819
right

1474
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:08,160
go look at the good outlier right see

1475
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,839
what they're doing right because it

1476
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,460
might be the opportunity to find a tool

1477
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,740
or a process or a workflow or something

1478
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,720
that's doing a little bit better that

1479
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,980
you can apply to the rest of the

1480
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,780
organization and help it do that and

1481
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,980
you're only going to get that when you

1482
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,720
start doing this kind of analysis at a

1483
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,700
much broader risk level you don't see

1484
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,380
that as common when you're looking at

1485
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,660
volume of patches being deployed

1486
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,240
right epilogue for that story by the way

1487
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,640
uh we did distribute that out minor

1488
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,200
adjustments for every region for all

1489
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,460
their variables

1490
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,619
um they went from

1491
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:39,319
I think they was originally it was like

1492
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:43,140
36 countries out of compliance to one in

1493
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,359
60 days

1494
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,520
what's that

1495
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,720
no actually

1496
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,300
it's pretty good in that company uh

1497
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,579
uh it works right risk factors let's

1498
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:54,839
look at that kind of stuff so look for

1499
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,700
outliers use this kind of analysis for

1500
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,980
risk outliers but don't forget about the

1501
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,260
good ones those are your opportunity to

1502
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,819
do better and to celebrate the people

1503
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,500
who are doing it right

1504
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,960
make sense okay

1505
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,339
so

1506
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,020
coming to the end of the talk thank you

1507
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,819
for sticking around

1508
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,099
um I want to reiterate again a couple of

1509
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:15,180
things right

1510
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,280
look everything moves super fast these

1511
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,040
days it's ridiculous

1512
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,300
we have a lot of power in our disposal

1513
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,980
and Technology but so do the attackers

1514
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,140
and the more that we can start to move

1515
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,720
away from the reactive responses the way

1516
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,520
we do things and the more we get away

1517
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,740
from just banking on our incident

1518
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,540
response teams

1519
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,640
the more that we look forward and ahead

1520
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,800
and understand our state

1521
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,599
the better prepared we are to make

1522
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,160
decisions about where we should focus

1523
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,079
our resources where should we focus our

1524
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,700
remediation efforts where should we

1525
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,579
focus our money and our teams where do

1526
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:48,900
we need training all of those questions

1527
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,520
start to surface when you start to look

1528
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,720
at that we're getting out of that place

1529
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,700
of saying how many patches do I need to

1530
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,579
deploy I should be asking questions like

1531
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:58,619
is patching even the right answer right

1532
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,300
now

1533
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,980
that's where we need to kind of be we

1534
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,260
need to get out of this I.T mindset of

1535
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,900
operational work and move into more of a

1536
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,520
data analysis and risk analysis mode

1537
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,380
because that's what we really honestly

1538
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,880
do best

1539
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,040
and once we're in that world

1540
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,599
just remember

1541
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,119
the communication part is key

1542
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:21,180
I cannot stress this enough

1543
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,000
every single organization all of them

1544
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,160
that I have consulted for or that I have

1545
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,960
run the security program

1546
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,859
the problem was never the process yeah

1547
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:34,440
problem is held in the process the

1548
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,660
problem was rarely the tools it was

1549
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,839
almost always a Communications problem

1550
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,660
Ops people didn't feel valued they felt

1551
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,220
the security team was just stealing all

1552
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,660
the credit for their Works they decided

1553
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,520
not to patch anything anymore

1554
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,079
because we didn't communicate to the

1555
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,760
board that it was the Ops Team doing the

1556
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,660
work

1557
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,880
right that's not them being stubborn

1558
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,079
that was our failure for not

1559
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,880
communicating

1560
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,460
I know that it's not fun and sexy and

1561
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,200
it's not pen testing and it's not all

1562
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,760
the cool stuff we get to do but I'm

1563
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,440
telling you

1564
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,300
understanding how to communicate better

1565
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,099
making it relevant to your audiences

1566
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:09,900
stepping outside of our kind of comfort

1567
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,660
zone of Technology into this risk space

1568
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,079
is where we win this is the place where

1569
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,640
people start to understand what we do

1570
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,619
the value of what we do and more

1571
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,960
importantly start buying in to what we

1572
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,859
do

1573
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,540
and whether it's a large organization or

1574
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,819
small getting people to buy into what

1575
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,140
you're doing

1576
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,760
that's where you're going to succeed and

1577
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,160
that's what we need to start moving to

1578
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,079
all right

1579
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,760
thank you very much for your time I'll

1580
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,260
happily we've got a couple minutes left

1581
