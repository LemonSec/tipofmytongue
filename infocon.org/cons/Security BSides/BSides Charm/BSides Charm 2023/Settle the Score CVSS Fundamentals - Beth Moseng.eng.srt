1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
foreign

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:21,380
[Music]

3
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,900
and this is my presentation uh settle

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,420
the score CVSs fundamentals will will be

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,119
going over just the basics of everything

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,880
just about CVSs because a lot of times

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
people know that the score exists but

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,140
how do you get that number well that's

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,820
that's a big question

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,719
uh

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,480
one of these days the clicker will work

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,140
oh

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,620
first I've been Pro programming for

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,180
eight plus years and I've been working

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,640
uh somewhere within the cyber community

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,559
learning about all of that for about six

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,260
years I'm also an avid enjoyer of Magic

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,120
the Gathering and a flautas in a video

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,860
game flute choir for that extra little

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,560
spice and then I my professional

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
experience I have been with Lockheed

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,119
Martin since 2019 through a bunch of

23
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,000
different teams so I was developing on

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
the M few team working a lot with RF

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,820
from 2019 to 2021 then I was transferred

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,240
over to their dice team doing a lot of

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,860
incident response and working in that

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,979
area from 2021 to 2022 and now I'm

29
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,720
currently working with offensive cyber

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,299
operations where I do a lot of

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,040
development for the actual cyber

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,259
community which is pretty cool and then

33
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,640
um and then I also have a bachelor's in

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,740
computer science who graduated as of

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,140
yesterday and you can see

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,939
a bunch of smiling faces

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,939
so very busy weekend for me as you can

38
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,860
tell

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,740
um and so now uh the start of it all uh

40
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,079
cve and CVSs you know a bunch of

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,000
alphabet soup and of course there will

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
be a lot more acronyms to go over as we

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,799
go on and we'll be rushing through those

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,959
um so what exactly is a cve well

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,239
actually it's uh cve's common

46
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,280
vulnerabilities and exposures and that

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,520
is the entire list of all of the uh

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
exposures and typically if someone

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
refers to acve they mean an entry inside

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,319
of you know the cve but you know

51
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,819
semantics everyone knows what you're

52
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,560
talking about when you say it

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,959
um and so what exactly it is is a

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,300
publicly documented security flaw found

55
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,400
in some sort of code base like

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,260
exploiting a buffer overflow that leads

57
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,300
to code execution you know all of that

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,980
little fun stuff that us hackers get to

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,920
do it is maintained by miter as you

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,760
might know from the miter attack

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,260
framework uh just a fun little company

62
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,319
there and it's was established in 1999.

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,300
all of these are stored in a lot of fun

64
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,099
places like National vulnerability

65
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,140
database which is maintained by someone

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,739
in the government and cves are given out

67
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,160
by cve numbering authorities and a bunch

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,980
of different companies are CNAs where

69
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,280
you can have one from let's go with

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,959
Lockheed Oracle all of those places that

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
maintain software and then you

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
they get assigned a nump a number of cve

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
IDs that they can assign throughout the

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,580
year so if you see a bunch of numbers

75
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,140
close together from a certain company

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,360
it's not because someone found a flaw

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,640
right next to each other uh in that same

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,080
company it's just because they have that

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,940
block of numbers to use and then here's

80
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,080
an example of a cve ID number the log j4

81
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,700
attack is the one I'll be using for just

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,739
kind of the example one going over the

83
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,019
intro and log j4 as you know was the one

84
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,519
where everyone's Minecraft got hacked

85
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,159
including yours your Minecraft

86
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,560
um and how it goes is it cve then the

87
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,700
year that it was found and then the

88
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,459
number assigned for the cve ID now what

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,280
qualifiers for a cve it needs to be

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,580
independently fixable so for example if

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,519
it is something that you need to fix it

92
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,200
by fixing about three different other

93
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,379
bugs and that's uh then it's not just a

94
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,000
cve you need to be able to just fix that

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,280
one patch and then you're fine

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
it needs to be acknowledged by the fence

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,298
the vendor or well documented and so

98
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,040
either like the person that developed

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,839
the software needs to say hey this is a

100
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,139
problem or someone needs to come out

101
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,240
with documentation saying that this goes

102
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,340
against the security policy and that it

103
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,320
impacts the actual usability and

104
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,780
security functionality of the code

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,520
and then it also needs to be affecting

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
one code basis if a cve

107
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,419
affects multiple different products then

108
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,820
if CBE affects multiple different

109
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,620
products then you would get a cve number

110
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,540
for each different product that it

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,479
affects and then if uh a code base would

112
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,479
have to if there is no way for the bug

113
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,280
to be fixed without

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,380
um fixing that one different code base

115
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,820
and that code base is using a bunch of

116
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,940
different products but the only reason

117
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,940
that it is combined like that then it

118
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,280
would have a specific CV one cve for

119
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,600
that multiple different products but

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
that's a rare case

121
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,580
and so what exactly is CVSs now that

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,259
I've kind of defined and gone over the

123
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:22,500
basics of cve well it stands for common

124
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,139
vulnerability scoring system and what

125
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,880
exactly it is is it's just kind of a

126
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
measure of severity of a different

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,139
exploit or exposure

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,979
um it was owned and managed by first uh

129
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,780
first stands for the Forum of incident

130
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
response and security teams and it's

131
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,919
been open since it's been maintained

132
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,639
since 2005 and then over on the left you

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,440
can see kind of like the difference in

134
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,380
ratings between CVSs version 2 and CVSs

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,880
version three

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
um CVSs version 3 has a lot more

137
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,380
difference than just how it's rated uh

138
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,780
we'll be going over that a little bit

139
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,539
um but as you can see it the higher the

140
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,699
number the more severe that it is and

141
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,979
then at the bottom of my bullet points

142
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,560
you can see a bunch of letters those

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,840
will make sense later on but I just

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,340
wanted to show an example of a written

145
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,560
out CVSs score

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,539
and uh

147
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,120
so that way then you can actually

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,759
qualify it or quantify it now how do

149
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,259
they relate I know that this talk is

150
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,600
about CVSs and you guys are all very

151
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,120
intrigued uh in CVSs

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,639
um but it relates to cves because most

153
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,699
cves are assigned to CVSs score and just

154
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,400
having a CVSs score without actually

155
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,560
knowing the thing that it's attached to

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,960
is pretty useless like oh hey something

157
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,600
got assigned a 10. cool what was that

158
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,000
something and so the cve kind of gives

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,600
you that context for what it is it also

160
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
shows the

161
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,740
it shows the severity of a specific

162
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,840
documented cve so people can accurately

163
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,039
identify the threat level of different

164
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,300
exploits

165
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,180
so a brief brief history of version

166
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,479
updates uh CVSs version one was created

167
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,300
in February of 2005. the first release

168
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,639
was found to be pretty buggy so they

169
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,080
updated to CVSs version 2 in 2007 and

170
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,660
then of course again nothing uh with its

171
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,039
first release patch is going to be

172
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
perfect so users needed too much

173
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,199
knowledge of vulnerabilities for CVSs

174
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,120
version 2 to be accurate you're never

175
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,560
going to know everything that's going on

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,479
inside of an exploit

177
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,300
um and then for CVSs version 3 it needed

178
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,099
a bit more clarification but not an

179
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,500
entirely new formula change so they came

180
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,740
out with tvss version 3.1 in June of

181
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,380
2019 and that's what's pretty widely

182
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,199
used today some places are still using

183
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,440
CVSs version 2 but typically the scores

184
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,419
aren't too far off but there were a lot

185
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,880
of differences in some being a bit

186
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,639
some being a bit scored too highly in

187
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,860
CVSs version 2.

188
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,500
um why is this important why is CVSs

189
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,380
something that is used in a lot of

190
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,240
places well first it's free and open so

191
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,919
free and open that I was able to make an

192
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,319
entire PowerPoint on this

193
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,759
um but also it's not proprietary

194
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,099
information I can use this inside of my

195
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,539
company someone else can use it inside

196
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,580
of their company and it's a way for

197
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,800
everyone to be able to accurately

198
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,280
communicate the different severity of

199
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,199
different flaws like it doesn't matter

200
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,919
if I am scoring something between 17 and

201
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,800
203 because we all know that someone out

202
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
there is going to use arbitrary numbers

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,659
to score something

204
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,179
you are able to have the same number

205
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,039
compared between different companies so

206
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,440
that way everyone can accurately have a

207
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,599
communication

208
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,219
like have communications between

209
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,020
companies to talk about these kinds of

210
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,760
threats so it's extremely important

211
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,620
important to have

212
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,360
good and open communication between

213
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,620
companies

214
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,300
um and then stripped directly from their

215
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,940
website CVSs was designed to provide

216
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,339
open and universally standards severity

217
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,740
ratings of software vulnerabilities and

218
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,720
it's just great to be able to have an

219
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,360
open conversation between companies

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,019
so what makes up a CVSs score this uh

221
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,920
little snippet is directly from their

222
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,260
CVSs score calculator from their website

223
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,200
you can click the little categories and

224
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,540
then when you do that it tells you what

225
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,580
score it's going to be and then here you

226
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,560
have all of the different metrics that

227
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,580
something with CVSs is defined by so you

228
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,140
know with the attack Vector it's either

229
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,060
going to be Network the adjacent Network

230
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,220
local and physical we'll go and be going

231
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,959
more into depth about the specific

232
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
categories later

233
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,800
but I just wanted to show a little bit

234
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
bigger picture so that string of letters

235
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,220
that I showed you guys earlier that I'd

236
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,260
say be going more into depth this is

237
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,779
where you get all of those values where

238
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,880
you would say attack Vector n and then

239
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,260
the next one you would say attack

240
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,200
complexity let's go with l

241
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,019
and then here is that uh that string at

242
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,180
the bottom with the

243
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,899
uh with the Minecraft Tech that is uh

244
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,519
just that way you can see where I was

245
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,980
getting those letters from and so now

246
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll be going into depth what the

247
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
different metrics mean so first with the

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
exploitability metrics you have the

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
attack vector and this is the level of

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,940
access required to exploit the

251
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,860
vulnerability meaning whether you need

252
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,560
to be physically at the computer or just

253
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,260
across the network or locally there and

254
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,660
so it's kind of where you need to be in

255
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,180
the context of the exploit then we have

256
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,880
the attack complexity it factors out of

257
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
the attacker's control to exploit the

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,500
vulnerability a low attack complexity

259
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,959
means that all of the factors needed to

260
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,300
exploit it would be inside of the

261
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,220
attacker so everything they need to do

262
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
is within their hands and a high

263
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,339
complexity means that they kind of need

264
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,320
to wait for specific circumstances or

265
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,060
those kinds of things

266
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,800
um the Privileges required as you can

267
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
probably guess is just whether or not

268
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,940
you need admin privileges or what kinds

269
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,060
so none would be you know no privileges

270
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,279
required maybe a guest account low would

271
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,260
be any common user and then high would

272
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,720
probably be admin and then we have the

273
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,200
user interaction uh the necessity of a

274
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,180
willing or unwitting participant to

275
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,880
succeed so either someone clicking on

276
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,500
that link that you told them not to

277
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
click on in the phishing email or

278
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
someone downloading a file that they

279
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,660
really shouldn't have or it can be

280
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,920
someone physically at the computer

281
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,500
saying oh I hate this company they fired

282
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,720
me I'm gonna help this hacker exploit

283
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
some malware and you have that man

284
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,440
inside so none would be no user

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,180
interaction and then required would be

286
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,779
any one of those uh situations and now

287
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,700
we have impact metrics and I know for

288
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,260
all of you that have either studied for

289
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,079
or got your SEC plus the CIA Triad is

290
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,720
going to look very familiar to you

291
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,579
um but you have the confidentiality

292
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,740
impact and so it's the amount of data

293
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,260
that the attacker gains access to

294
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,160
um

295
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,040
uh and then you know none low or high

296
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,959
all of those three are the same for

297
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,779
these three categories and then you have

298
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,640
the Integrity impact it's the ability

299
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,740
for the attacker to change the physical

300
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,959
data and then you have the availability

301
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
impact which is the ability to change

302
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,360
the accessibility of the data so I guess

303
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,640
changing privileges uh probably

304
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,860
executable but anything of where you're

305
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,339
changing the availability and now we

306
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,440
have the scope metric either changed or

307
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,860
unchanged the scope is if this exploit

308
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,899
can propagate to other components like

309
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,480
leading to more exploits being used for

310
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,019
example if I'm able to get a certain

311
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,779
hack inside of a computer does that open

312
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,880
the door for me to be able to use a

313
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,620
bunch more or is it kind of a one and

314
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,380
done scenario

315
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,540
um so all of those metrics before were

316
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,760
just for the base score and that's what

317
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,519
is next to any sort of cve because it

318
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,620
doesn't change these are two other

319
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,899
scores that you can have uh or I won't

320
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,519
be going over these two too much in

321
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,260
depth but it's a temporal and

322
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,180
environmental and the temporal score

323
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,160
kind of adds to

324
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,019
the base score which are metrics that

325
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,779
change over time like if an exploit is a

326
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,160
lot more severe when you first learn

327
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
about it or if it over time it becomes

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,860
maybe more documented and wow it's it's

329
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,959
a lot more worse than we thought

330
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,200
um and so this is how uh how the score

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
would change over time and then the

332
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,339
second one is environmental which is uh

333
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,899
factors that change from person to

334
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,000
person like maybe your level of

335
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,220
antivirus software or your operating

336
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,500
system and that kind of thing so it's

337
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,019
the severity of the attack based on each

338
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,300
person and you can't exactly just slap

339
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,899
this score onto every every cve because

340
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,540
it changes so often so these two aren't

341
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,180
as widely used than the base score

342
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,940
and now here we go into a case study

343
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,579
where I go a little bit of Dipping my

344
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,279
toes into vulnerability exploitation

345
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,200
um and showing my thought process while

346
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,260
using my knowledge of CVSs and what the

347
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,839
scores mean to think yeah I could do

348
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,720
that I could totally do that

349
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,760
um so my first thought was let's look at

350
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,279
the top 10 exploits in 2022 what all

351
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,740
happened there was the obvious ones like

352
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,839
log4 shell spring four shell and like

353
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,180
the Chrome zero a day but everyone has

354
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,700
done a talk about that so I wanted to do

355
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,579
something that maybe wasn't as widely

356
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,279
known uh and on purple sex website was

357
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,200
cve 2017 1182 and I saw that the an

358
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,600
exploit from 2017 was still extremely

359
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,260
widely used in 2022 and that was pretty

360
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,240
interesting to me like how is that still

361
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
viable five years later so I was like

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,199
yeah sure I'll check this out I have

363
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,320
nothing better to do so what exactly is

364
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,660
it uh it's a bug in multiple versions of

365
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,880
the Microsoft Office Service Pack that

366
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,980
allows an attacker to run arbitrary code

367
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,139
in the context of the current user by

368
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,120
failing to properly handle objects in

369
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,040
memory what what does that mean to some

370
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,079
people who don't know what that means

371
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,320
well the Microsoft Office Service Pack

372
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,260
is handling data in a way that it

373
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,079
shouldn't be and that leads to you being

374
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,120
able to redirect of what code it should

375
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,579
be executing next and injecting your own

376
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,620
code inside of that so instead of

377
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,660
running the next line you're now running

378
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,199
whatever hack I put into it and in my

379
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,820
case it was running I think the command

380
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,480
line and over on the left you can see

381
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
the picture just the physical picture

382
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,980
because I know that that blob of letters

383
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,440
below probably doesn't synergize with

384
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,220
everyone so I saw that you needed to be

385
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,740
local and well I'm local I have my

386
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,500
computer I can execute that the attack

387
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,660
complexity was low and the Privileges

388
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,220
required were none and both of those

389
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,339
appealed to me because that is something

390
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,899
that if x would it could be pretty

391
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,120
dangerous because you don't need any

392
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,180
privileges or extraneous circumstances

393
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,180
to do it and it does need user

394
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,800
interaction but it's mostly just the

395
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,839
user needs to click on the thing that

396
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,139
you want them to unwitting or wittingly

397
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,480
um the scope is unchanged and that

398
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,699
didn't matter to me as much because I

399
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,220
was just kind of seeing if I could run

400
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,440
this on my computer and then the cool

401
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,980
part is that uh it impacted all of the

402
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,720
confidentiality integrity and

403
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
availability on a very high level which

404
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,620
appealed to me because if this is a

405
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,320
simple attack that I could do and it has

406
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,500
this amount of data change and access

407
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,660
then that that's pretty that's pretty

408
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,760
rad it had through all of these things

409
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,800
it had a base score of 7.8 which is

410
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,959
pretty high and the reason that it

411
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,899
wasn't you know Perfect 10 was because

412
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,240
of the scope being unchanged the attack

413
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,279
Vector needing to be local and the user

414
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,699
interaction needing to be required

415
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,279
um so trying to test the exploit after

416
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,279
about 30 seconds of searching on the

417
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,320
internet with the Google search

418
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,220
parameters being just the cve ID I found

419
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,240
a GitHub link and as everyone knows

420
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,459
github's pretty cool

421
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,079
um so

422
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,160
um guys

423
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,720
I love GitHub

424
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,119
um the contents of this repository was

425
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,199
not only a readme with extremely well

426
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,939
documentation uh there were comments

427
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,559
everywhere that I needed it to be um

428
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,359
there was an entire exploitation script

429
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,980
in Python where you just kind of needed

430
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,939
to run it with the commands with the

431
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,980
different command line arguments with

432
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,780
the extremely well documentation that it

433
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,580
gave me it was great

434
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,440
um it also had debugging instructions

435
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
with specific break points where if it

436
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,980
didn't work hey here's where you go to

437
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,140
look extremely well documented it was

438
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,960
great the hacker Community wants you to

439
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,020
hack others it's so

440
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,179
um so here are the steps taken uh very

441
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,480
riveting I downloaded the script I ran

442
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,580
the script with the instructions given

443
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,320
so just the very few command line

444
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,200
arguments it created an executable and

445
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,580
then I clicked on that executable very

446
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,340
riveting very obviously difficult I'm

447
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,440
kidding this was very easy

448
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,220
um does it work long story short uh yes

449
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,679
but I have Windows Defender and Windows

450
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,600
Defender really wants to help me except

451
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,059
for when uh I'm trying to create a

452
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,860
presentation about exploiting my

453
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,000
computer

454
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,179
yeah

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,340
um short story long ish

456
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,879
oh

457
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,900
I swear that there's more to my

458
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,320
presentation

459
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,100
uh short story long after realizing that

460
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,020
my python version was wrong remember

461
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,799
kids python 2 can save lives

462
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,799
um I uh quite literally all I needed to

463
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:48,660
run was the exploitation script hey

464
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,380
um

465
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,520
not hey

466
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,500
uh all I needed to run was the

467
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,299
exploitation script the way that it was

468
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,799
telling me to

469
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,559
um with this with saying cmd.exe that's

470
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,299
the executable that I wanted it to run

471
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,520
with the output file of the name and

472
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,559
then I run the output file and then of

473
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,660
course you know Windows Defender deletes

474
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,340
the script and then gives me the little

475
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,679
fun pop-up it's doing its best but that

476
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,059
does mean that I was trying to do

477
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,380
something that I shouldn't have been

478
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,460
which I count that as a personal Victory

479
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,760
um so connecting it back uh that was a

480
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
very simple exploit for me to do I

481
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,960
showed you the steps I showed you why I

482
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,299
thought that I'd be able to do that

483
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,620
um and it worked enough it worked enough

484
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,480
um but if my system wasn't patched for

485
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,220
it I would have been able to impact the

486
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,020
security on my device to a very

487
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,120
substantial amount as I've said before

488
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,360
it had a very high scores for

489
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,980
confidentiality availability and

490
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,760
integrity of data which was pretty

491
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
interesting to me

492
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,740
um so here are the takeaways um Windows

493
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,080
Defender it's pretty good uh I don't

494
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,820
think I have other antivirus software on

495
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,380
my system because I already knew Windows

496
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,900
Defender does not suck

497
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,299
um hackers make it very easy for people

498
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,039
to get their hands on potentially

499
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,100
dangerous software again 30 seconds of

500
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,200
Googling gave me the exploit script that

501
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,960
I needed to run that exploit and knowing

502
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,419
why something has a high CVSs score can

503
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,299
save a lot of Heartache it

504
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,940
had very easy steps for me to take

505
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,860
through and I thought that I could do it

506
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,780
because I read the information that was

507
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,240
easily given to me and I used it to the

508
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,419
best of my ability and

509
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,700
I was able to succeed and give this talk

510
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,640
to you all so uh thank you my name is

511
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,860
Beth mosang and you can follow me on the

512
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,539
Twitter account that I don't use and

513
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,860
just made so I would be able to put it

514
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,780
on this presentation

515
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,799
um

516
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,150
uh thank you any questions

517
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:58,299
[Applause]

518
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,460
yes

519
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,640
the top critiques

520
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,539
um is that it probably it's still just

521
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,820
as a score there isn't as much

522
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,000
documentation of more of the specifics

523
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,100
like yes it says user interaction

524
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,559
required but does it mean that someone

525
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,360
just needs to arbitrarily click it or

526
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,700
someone needs to knowingly Do It

527
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,799
um essentially it just doesn't have as

528
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,220
much details as it probably should have

529
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,059
um other critiques probably is that it

530
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,159
does change over time like through the

531
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,100
different version updates uh between CVS

532
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,440
version 2 and CVSs version three like

533
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,240
you have to be specific when talking

534
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,179
about it of what you're doing

535
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,280
um and there's still probably other bugs

536
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,600
with the current system that they're

537
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,039
still trying to fix just because it

538
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,200
isn't a perfect system

539
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,280
um

540
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,980
nothing's going to be perfect and I'd

541
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,860
say that uh the

542
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,080
best part is probably just

543
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,500
being able to have a baseline Community

544
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,000
communication with other people

545
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,820
am I good to take more questions or

546
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,360
cool

547
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,039
um uh Chris

548
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,419
um

549
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,080
I haven't taken uh as much time on some

550
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,220
of the smaller exploits but as I've kind

551
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,380
of mentioned before

552
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,159
uh

553
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,940
that

554
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,220
for the smaller for I'd say it's

555
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,940
probably the lower that you get in this

556
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,539
in score for example of the lower

557
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,299
numbers maybe anywhere from one to four

558
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,799
it gets

559
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,280
less important of what the actual score

560
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,159
is just because it's either a lot harder

561
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,380
for someone to implement or because

562
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,559
there's less data that's being changed

563
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,380
in that kind of aspect but even scores

564
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,520
with low scores still have an impact or

565
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,020
else they wouldn't have a score in

566
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,080
general just because they are an exploit

567
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,600
so I'd say while understanding

568
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,360
uh what the score is for some of the

569
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,640
smaller exploits it still is good to

570
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,419
treat most as a Potential Threat just

571
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,539
because of the idea that just that it

572
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,460
still is an exploit and it still has the

573
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,440
potential to do harm to your system so

574
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,940
even if it

575
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,539
doesn't seem something as impactful it

576
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,000
still has the potential to do greater

577
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,299
things

578
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,960
[Applause]

579
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,080
thank you
