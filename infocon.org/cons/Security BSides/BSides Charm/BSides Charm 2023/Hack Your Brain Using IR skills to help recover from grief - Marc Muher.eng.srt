00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,480
current title is the using IR skills to

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,098
learn about the brain I may have called

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,380

and say anything I'm really not but

13
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,520
but I do have a couple qualifications I

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,379
I have a master's in social worker

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,960
mastered in cyber security I have a lot

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,660
of unearned confidence and I and I have

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,180
a cissp so

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,980
you know that kind of explains the whole

19
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,120
deal oh sorry

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,679
okay no

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,420
no okay so um

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,000
oh and why am I given this talk

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
honestly the look The World is kind of

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,380
crappy right now there's a lot of

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,880
there's a lot of stuff going around I

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,460
mean I'm I'm speaking myself but I feel

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,720
like we could all use a little bit of

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,580
patience sometimes

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,619
is this better okay

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,119
um

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,500
also I'm getting cu's for doing this so

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,380
yeah it's just a never-ending

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,619
never-ending battle so okay so the

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,479
basics so we're gonna so the pickerel

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,400
response framework it's you know the

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,259
basic framework we all learned about you

37
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,820
know it's in every book it's in

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,140
everything

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,119
um you know it it involves six stages

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,880
I've made this one a little realistic

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,820
and turn prevention down to very tiny

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,460
because nobody you know that's all the

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,500
stuff that we're supposed to do as you

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,840
know as cyber security people that we

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
don't you know it never really happened

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,500
so so we're gonna start with you know

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,899
the the other part of the uh the pick or

48
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,540
else and system which is the isolation

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,200
containment eradication recovery and

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,920
Lessons Learned so you know basic steps

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,680
so in in dealing with grief and dealing

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,540
with the human mind there's we you know

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,180
we we have other Frameworks too so so

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
one of the Frameworks this is one of the

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,280
other framers to use for for grief are

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,739
the Kubler-Ross stages of grief

57
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,060
so five stages here and frankly if you

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,360
thought that it had bad acronyms look at

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,680
dabda so so you know you have a denial

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
anger bargaining depression and

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,900
acceptance so the thing with stages of

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,599
grief is you know it it's nice they they

63
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,940
look real nice here on the on the on the

64
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,319
page but

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,599
you know there's no rule that says it

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,760
has to go in this order you know you can

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,680
stuff gets out of whack all the time

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,620
it's normal you know so if so you don't

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,660
have to start with denial if you can

70
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,420
start with something else but

71
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,900
so um and the little and here's a little

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,819
bit more just about grief in general

73
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,860
because you know because we say grief

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,440
you know and and that's a big word and

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,180
you know and like many things you know

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,819
it's a word that needs needs a real

77
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,680
definition so we're talking about the

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,140
causes of grief the causes of loss you

79
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
know we're talking death of someone

80
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,980
important to you and and I just want to

81
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,560
put here that means important to you not

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,840
important to other people because you

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,560
know that it's a loss is a loss

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,280
um

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,200
what else you know what other what other

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,959
things can cause grief just illness you

87
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,299
know I mean this is you know that I mean

88
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,459
kind of one of the classic presentations

89
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,379
of this is you know when somebody gets

90
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,440
you know a bad diagnosis you know and

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,599
you go through those stages you know

92
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,760
that's that's an illness you know money

93
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,940
and career obviously huge stressors Life

94
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,159
Changes like moving and graduation those

95
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,200
can cause those can trigger a grief

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
response

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,060
um love or lack thereof always you know

98
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,820
always a stressor and of course holidays

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,760
always terrible stressor

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,919
but you know there's normal grief and

101
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,720
then when there's time to get help and I

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,520
do want to make sure that you know we

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,440
clarify when people that need to get

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
help

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,620
you know you don't want to if you if

106
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,840
you're injuring yourself or others if

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,699
you're really negatively affecting your

108
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,860
life not just changing things but you

109
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,680
know Burning Bridges

110
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,940
um also if you're already prone to

111
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,919
depression

112
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,020
um you have other major stressors going

113
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,580
on because you know stuff doesn't

114
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,919
normally happen once at a time and also

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,960
if this goes on for a really long amount

116
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,880
of time like not we're not talking a

117
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,860
week you know of of going through this

118
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,240
we're talking in months we're talking

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,540
year I mean a really long amount of time

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,580
so so those are things when you really

121
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,320
need to get help you really need to seek

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
a professional so which I am not by the

123
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,380
way

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
um

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
so so the stages so so my basic premise

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,220
here is these stages do correspond to

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,139
each other so so what we know about the

128
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,080
pickerel system can help us make help us

129
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
remember what stages of the Kubler-Ross

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,820
system we're in you know the we start

131
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,560
off isolation you know that's when we're

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,660
you know that's you're getting you first

133
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,120
get the alert you know you're you're

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,880
verifying you're you're getting scope

135
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,500
you know

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,419
excuse me

137
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,520
um you know you're this is where you

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
know this is where you get an alert and

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
you're checking out you know is it's you

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,220
know is it an actual virus or is it you

141
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,560
know somebody running a weird script you

142
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
know uh in the in in the grief stage

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,300
that kind of corresponds to denial

144
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,240
denial is you know that first what do

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
you mean that you know that first um no

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,320
that can't be happening no no if that's

147
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,199
the wrong person no check again you know

148
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,419
and you know that's denial it's shock

149
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,539
it's confusion it's avoidance

150
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,240
sometimes it's even it does present as

151
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
some relief though because

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,199
the brain is weird

153
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,740
um next stage containment so containment

154
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,419
you know that's where we you know okay

155
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,880
you verified the alerts correct okay now

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,740
we got a quarantine now we gotta limit

157
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,720
the spread we got we have to find out

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,819
exactly what we need we're scoping out

159
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,580
you know what what our changes are or

160
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,759
what we what what has happened and and

161
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,139
that's what we're gonna you know and

162
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,419
that's what we're gonna focus on

163
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,699
in the stages group that corresponds to

164
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,160
anger so anger that mental stage is

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,720
grief you know we're all pretty familiar

166
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,539
with that you know it's it comes out you

167
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,759
know it's that frustration it's

168
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,460
you know it's irritation it's anxiety

169
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,880
but what you know it's it's the it's the

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
mind it's taking that pain and

171
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,380
attempting to put that pain

172
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,660
elsewhere it's it's directing it

173
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,479
externally that's anger you know and

174
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,419
look that's a it's a pretty hard stage

175
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,620
to get through sometimes

176
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
next we're down to eradication in our

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
system eradication is is where we

178
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,840
removed uh you know we removed the virus

179
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,840
or removed whatever sort of you know and

180
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,319
you know incidents happening and we're

181
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,120
working on remediating you know we have

182
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,880
a scope we know what we're doing and now

183
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
we're just getting rid of it

184
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,599
so that kind of corresponds to

185
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,539
depression in the in the kubler-rah

186
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,940
stage where you know where the

187
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,680
depression you know where where the

188
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,539
eradication you know where you're doing

189
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,520
something but you're really just kind of

190
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,759
trying to maintain the status quo so so

191
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
the depression it's the same thing

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,759
you're you're in that stage of

193
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,099
helplessness you're overwhelmed

194
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,380
you know you I mean there's hostility

195
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,780
here and sometimes there's just there's

196
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,759
running you know because

197
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,500
because you know again the brain's

198
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,060
trying to avoid that pain you know it's

199
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,919
trying to move on

200
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,020
so

201
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,099
then finally or not finally next is the

202
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,860
recovery stage of of the uh pickerel

203
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
system you know and that's where you're

204
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,699
getting back to prod you know you're

205
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,860
getting you're getting people working

206
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,139
again you know computers work and you

207
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,139
know whatever the business is ongoing

208
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,240
so and that's and that's just what

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,559
you're trying to do is get back there

210
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,659
and and that leads to and that

211
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,339
corresponds to bargaining there's a

212
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,679
bargaining stage to to the stages of

213
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,679
grief and you know and again it's you're

214
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,300
making deals you're making deals with

215
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,220
yourself you're making deals you're

216
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,899
you're trying to figure out a way around

217
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,519
this your brain is trying to process

218
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,019
this you're you're trying to find

219
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,060
Alternatives you're getting a second

220
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,220
opinion you're and you're trying to find

221
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,779
meaning and all you're trying to find

222
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,580
what it what it does what it means

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,180
then finally we have Lessons Learned you

224
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,100
know the the other part of the pickerel

225
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,200
thing that most people just avoid

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,240
because you're too busy but

227
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,860
but Lessons Learned that's where you're

228
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,480
like okay this what this is what

229
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,980
happened how we're gonna stop it from

230
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,380
happening again what you know what did

231
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,120
we learn what improvements can we make

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
you know do we need do we need a new

233
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,779
antivirus do we need to make sure you

234
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,500
know

235
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,839
that we're vulnerability scanning

236
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,700
something like that you're you're you're

237
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,519
doing you're making improvements and

238
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,200
you're trying to avoid going through

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,519
this again

240
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,380
and that's where you get to Acceptance

241
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,920
in in the stages of grief you know

242
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,440
that's where it's where you know you

243
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,080
kind of make peace at you know at some

244
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
stage at some point with the grief you

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,820
know you're creating a plan for the

246
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,519
future you're you're creating realistic

247
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,800
options you know you're you're moving

248
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
forward you know but with

249
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,540
you know but with full knowledge that

250
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,080
you're dealing with that grief so

251
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,200
so what does this all help us I mean you

252
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
know I mean I kind of talked about it

253
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,399
but but we do have to you know this does

254
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,680
kind of we do have to deal with this you

255
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,240
know both with ourselves and other

256
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,380
people

257
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,160
so so kind of there's different at

258
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,200
different stages of the of the grief

259
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,500
process the person is more or less you

260
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,459
know is

261
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,160
more receptive to certain talks like

262
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,519
like so here so in go so as you go down

263
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,860
those stages of denial anger bargaining

264
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,959
depression and acceptance you know

265
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
you're You're Gonna Change what you can

266
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,320
do you know at first you're only going

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
to be able to listen you're going to be

268
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,620
able to you're going to be able to be

269
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,660
like man you know that that's really

270
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,640
tough that's that's tough you know I

271
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,040
mean you know you know what whatever you

272
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,240
say to somebody who's going through

273
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
grief however you're dealing with it

274
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
yourself too

275
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,180
so and notes and listening and info you

276
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,040
know and as the person kind of gets into

277
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
that bargaining stage gets into the in

278
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,060
the depression stage where they're

279
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,100
they've gained a little perspective you

280
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,899
know and that's where you know and

281
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,279
that's where they really need the

282
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,620
emotional support that's where you know

283
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,120
and that's and this goes for yourself

284
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,220
too I mean you know you need to know

285
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,260
yourself that that's where you're going

286
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,720
to need some emotional support and then

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,640
you know once that final once a person's

288
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,500
in the acceptance stage that's when you

289
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,660
can start you know with guidance you

290
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,240
know but but you know it's more like you

291
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
know if you

292
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,600
you know you don't want you know let's

293
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,579
say somebody gets in a bad car accident

294
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,560
you know you don't want to show up at

295
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,120
the hospital and be like

296
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,700
hey let's go get you in a new car right

297
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,560
now you know while they're still hooked

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,079
up to tubes you know you're you know you

299
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,760
don't have that guidance you know you

300
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,160
you need to move that on to the into the

301
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,279
longer stages into the later stages of

302
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,480
the uh

303
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,920
of the of the grief process so

304
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
okay

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
now there's problems so

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760
you know the coupler Ross stage is grief

307
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
it's possibly all just made up or I mean

308
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,980
it is all made up I mean it was in you

309
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,740
know somebody invented uh Elizabeth

310
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,839
Kubler-Ross in the late 60s early 70s I

311
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,779
think you know said hey you know based

312
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,519
on you know based on their you know

313
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,380
their knowledge their experience they

314
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,440
said hey here's what I've been seeing

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,120
and you know and it and it you know

316
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,600
resonated so maybe it works but look you

317
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,339
know psychological theories come and go

318
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,040
all the time you know it's that's just

319
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,040
how it is the you know there's also and

320
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
also anytime you're talking about

321
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,360
psychological theories you you really

322
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,880
have to acknowledge the gigantic

323
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,820
cultural bias that that that goes into

324
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,279
that goes into creating these theories

325
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
okay so so think about it like like how

326
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,600
do you develop how do you develop

327
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,339
psychological theories okay well you

328
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,899
need you to get therapists who deal with

329
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,600
their patients and stuff also you deal

330
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,399
with a lot of college students you deal

331
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,800
with a lot of uh affluent people or more

332
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,959
affluent people who can afford therapy

333
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,120
you know you get college students also

334
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,220
who are going to take you know they'll

335
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,600
be like yeah I'll take a couple hours

336
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,700
worth of standardized test for 10 bucks

337
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,920
I mean you know that's just what you do

338
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,899
in college you know when they do labs

339
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,779
and stuff and so but that does give you

340
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,480
a pretty self-selecting population you

341
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,120
know so so you do have to you know

342
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
decide you know does this really curse

343
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,920
does this really work for everybody or

344
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,839
does this work for you know

345
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,139
people who were in college in the 70s

346
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,180
and 80s when they were developing these

347
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,560
things

348
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,320
so also all psychological models are

349
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
flawed because you know everyone's

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,660
different you know in you know it's a

351
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,040
everything's so granular that you know

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,860
no two people are the same you know and

353
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,320
the you know it can all be

354
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,260
it can all just basically be made up you

355
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,360
know but but generally when you have a

356
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,459
when you have one that resonates there's

357
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,940
at least some validity to it so that's

358
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,779
why I chose the uh the Kubler-Ross here

359
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,279
um

360
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,680
finally any questions

361
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,839
so that's it for my presentation thank

362
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,160
you all

363
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,440
um yeah I'm happy to take any questions

364
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,540
apparently we don't have a microphone so

365
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,459
if you just shout it out and I'll repeat

366
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,739
it if if there's any questions

367
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,560
cool awesome hey everybody thank you

368
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,839
very much for for coming and listening

369
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,139
to me

370
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,959
I I do appreciate this just just getting

371
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,820
this idea that's been in my head getting

372
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,040
it out of here and into well everybody

373
