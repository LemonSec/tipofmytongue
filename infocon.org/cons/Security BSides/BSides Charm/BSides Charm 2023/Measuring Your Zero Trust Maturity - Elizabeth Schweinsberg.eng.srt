[Music]

3
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,640
welcome this is going to be measuring

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,939
your zero trust maturity thank you for

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,880
coming out on such a dreary day and

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,159
staying to almost the very end of the

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,160
conference this will be worth it I'm

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,260
Elizabeth schweinberg and I work at the

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,480
centers for Medicare and Medicaid

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,959
services

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,660
so a little bit more about me and why

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,420
you should listen so my official title

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,840
is as a digital Services expert at the

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,719
U.S digital service we help different

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,899
federal agencies with their Digital

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,320
Services most of my co-workers help work

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,960
on

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,659
websites and other types of services for

19
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,939
the public

20
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,979
but when I ended up at centers for

21
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,140
Medicare and Medicaid services we call

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,460
it CMS

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,520
because we're in Maryland we're just in

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,340
Woodlawn on the other side of 695 we

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,420
wanted to be one of the cool

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,240
three-letter agencies

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,560
um so I've been there about two and a

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,540
half years and about a year and a half

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,780
ago summer of 2021 I started leading

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,880
their zero trust architecture

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,400
so I'm a long time practitioner of

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,619
digital forensics incident response and

33
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,079
threat detection and I spent about a

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,579
decade doing it in corporate

35
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,400
environments

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,040
when I made the transition to the

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
digital service

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,380
I became a zero trust architecture and a

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,659
lot of that was because of my experience

40
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,540
directly in the corporate world my

41
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,280
companies I worked for had gone through

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,979
zero trust Transformations and I was

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,420
able to work with the corporate security

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,640
teams and really understand the

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,160
fundamentals

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,419
so what are we going to talk about today

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,459
so I'm going to start with and overall

48
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,280
what is zero trust we'll talk

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,640
specifically about the sisa zero trust

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
model maturity model how to apply zero

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,459
trust to your environment

52
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,040
how CMS measured our zero trust maturity

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
which was super fun and give you some

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,420
tips for creating your own framework and

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,500
doing the next best thing

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,280
so what is zero trust zero trust is a

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,260
security model that emphasizes

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,440
frequently verifying trust relationships

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,959
you move from checking permissions at

60
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,420
the perimeter to checking permissions as

61
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,480
one moves throughout the system

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,519
user starts with zero trust when you

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,440
show up and as you collect more

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,860
information about the user

65
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,959
you can choose whether to increase that

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
trust or decrease that trust I like to

67
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
think of it as trying to go to a

68
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,840
professional sports ball game

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,280
so this is a wonderful replica of Oriole

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,560
Park at Camden Yards where the Beloved

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
Maryland Baltimore Orioles play and when

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,959
you show up to a game the first thing

73
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,400
you do is you have to go through a bag

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
check and a metal detector they want to

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,720
make sure you're not bringing in

76
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,940
anything untoward

77
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,120
and that's similar to running anti-virus

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,540
and EDR on our systems to make sure that

79
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,459
they're healthy next up you're going to

80
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,319
get your ticket scanned are you there

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,360
for the right day the right time yes no

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,700
better come back a different time this

83
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,440
is like your Authentication

84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,519
and then when you get to your section uh

85
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,959
your ticket is going to get checked

86
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,280
again to make sure you're in the right

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,780
place you're not trying to sneak into

88
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,120
the more expensive seats as you go

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,620
throughout the stadium you might see

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,420
other checks like if you go to a

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,420
concession stand and try to buy an

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,799
alcoholic beverage you're going to have

93
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,720
to prove you're 21.

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,819
if you are going to the club level

95
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,560
there's a check just get up there

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,420
because they've got fancy concessions

97
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,720
and not just anybody can get them

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,000
so

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,040
um that's you know making sure that you

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
have permissions to different systems

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,919
and applications as you try to do the

102
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,780
job

103
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,960
there are three popular zero trust

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,940
Frameworks particularly if you are in

105
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,460
the federal government

106
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,040
the first one is the nist special

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,520
publication 800 207 zero trust

108
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,759
architecture and it uses seven tenants

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,240
for you to think about as you are

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,100
building your systems and they give

111
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,020
three architecture approaches this one

112
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,460
tends to be a little bit more Network

113
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,660
Centric

114
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,639
then there's the dod zero trust

115
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,979
reference architecture they use Seven

116
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,620
Pillars to describe an environment and

117
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,060
within each pillar there are different

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,040
functions there are three maturity

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,160
levels and then lastly we have the sisa

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,400
zero trust maturity model which has five

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,699
pillars each with their own functions

122
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,340
three cross-cutting functions and four

123
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,139
maturity levels

124
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,660
all right now

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,960
um so this is it in depth the Five

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,020
Pillars are identity devices networks

127
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,740
applications workloads and data so when

128
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,600
I talk about a function what do I mean

129
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,880
by that so if you have an identity

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,160
system there are some things it needs to

131
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,800
do to be an identity system we'll start

132
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
with you need a list of your users some

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,479
sort of user store you are going to need

134
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,240
some authentication

135
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,160
to be a good identity provider you're

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,419
going to need some sort of risk

137
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,820
assessment and some sort of privilege

138
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,680
management

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
so each of the Five Pillars have very

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,919
specific functions you fulfill all those

141
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,740
things and well most of those things and

142
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,360
you can do the job

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,720
and in addition to those four functions

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,940
for identity and

145
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,100
across the line there are also three

146
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,400
cross-cutting functions that each pillar

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
must fulfill visibility and analytics

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,120
Automation orchestration and governance

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
so this is the main difference between

150
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,120
the dod model and the sysazero trust

151
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,460
model

152
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,160
DOD gives visibility and analytics and

153
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
automation orchestration their own

154
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
pillars

155
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
otherwise the other five pillars are the

156
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,800
same

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
just integrates them into each one

158
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,960
calling out specific things that you

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,620
need to have visible or be able to

160
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,720
analyze and or automate and orchestrate

161
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,979
and then as of April 10th after I had

162
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,919
already made my draft of the slides

163
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,620
ciso released version two of the

164
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,539
maturity model where they went from

165
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,780
three levels to four levels originally

166
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,819
it was just traditional Advanced optimal

167
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,060
and now we have a new level initial

168
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,979
which actually I fully support

169
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,080
so traditional is just the way we've

170
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
been doing security for the last 20 30

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,220
years there's going to be a lot of

172
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,340
manual configurations the pillars don't

173
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,599
really work together they're pretty

174
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,860
siled any uh permissions would be set at

175
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,599
provisioning and you're going to have

176
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,280
limited visibility

177
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,080
As you move into initial you're going to

178
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,340
start to have automation maybe you

179
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,380
um use some sort of gold image to

180
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
provision your laptops every time so you

181
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,699
don't have to go through and click

182
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,520
knick-knack next next on your windows

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,319
you're going to start seeing some cross

184
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,940
pillar integration one of the more

185
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,340
popular things that I've seen is around

186
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,960
device certificates

187
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,340
and using those to enable network access

188
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,620
so in gone are the days where anybody

189
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,160
could walk up with a network cable plug

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,960
into the wall get access to your

191
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,419
corporate environment now it's going to

192
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,000
ask for your device certificate if you

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
don't have it maybe you get put on a

194
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,979
special VLAN if you do have it great you

195
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,960
can access the corporate Network

196
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
you might start seeing time changes

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
around permissions so

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm a system administrator sometimes I

199
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,059
need to do really administrative things

200
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,200
and it's going instead of letting me be

201
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,120
the highest privilege all the time I can

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
turn it on and after a set amount of

203
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
time it'll turn off

204
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,860
and then we're also going to get

205
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,740
aggregated visibility so this is where

206
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,320
we centralize our logs

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,180
because when you put all your logs in

208
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,060
the same place you can find them later

209
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,220
moving into advanced automation

210
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,600
everywhere

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,240
your policy enforcement is going to be

212
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,420
integrated across all of your pillars

213
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,279
you're not just going to do time-based

214
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,220
enhancements or dehancements to your

215
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,459
different privileges but maybe there

216
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,300
will be changes based on risk or posture

217
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,760
so if you are coming from your laptop

218
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,339
your corporate laptop you can do one

219
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,200
thing but if on your you're on your

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,820
mobile phone maybe it's a bring your own

221
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,800
device kind of situation

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,779
maybe you can only access your email and

223
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,420
calendar and any serious data you don't

224
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,680
have access to

225
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,140
and then not only are we getting all of

226
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,500
our logs on the same place we are also

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
able to integrate the visibility of them

228
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,100
then as we move into optimal we are

229
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
fully automated just in time all sorts

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,380
of all the pillars are talking to each

231
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,760
other

232
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,360
our permissions are dynamically set

233
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,860
enterprise-wide and not just are we

234
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,740
centralizing our information but we are

235
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,640
also using it for situational

236
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
awareness because

237
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,060
um uh we can like look at the history of

238
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,320
people and use that to inform us of what

239
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,600
uh what is going on

240
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,399
I'm going to preserve questions at the

241
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,519
end

242
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,860
so I was like sweet we got this maturity

243
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,200
model I'm going to take it and I'm going

244
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,839
to compare it to our environment and we

245
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,839
are going to know how mature we are and

246
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,519
then we started trying to talk about

247
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
this and we found some very interesting

248
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,240
things

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,279
zero trust looks different in different

250
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,000
environments so to continue with the

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
sports metaphor

252
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,200
I talked about how things look when you

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,459
go to

254
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,459
um Camden Yards now let's say instead we

255
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,380
were going to go to Pimlico and watch

256
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,380
the horses race in a couple of weeks it

257
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,079
is a very different setup you've got the

258
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,019
inside the track view

259
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,420
um uh you've got the big tall building

260
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,120
you can sit in and there's different

261
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
zones how people move between the zones

262
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,779
are different what you're allowed to

263
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,019
bring into the horse uh well to Pimlico

264
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:22,980
is different than what you can bring

265
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,440
into Camden Yards the hats are different

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,240
it's just a completely different

267
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,720
environment that you really need to

268
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,279
um think about differently

269
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,120
so some of the specific things we found

270
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,760
was one of the things was identity in

271
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,980
different environments so when you're in

272
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,300
your just talking about your Enterprise

273
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,060
environment you're thinking about staff

274
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,640
and contractors and how they use

275
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,600
business applications sweet

276
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,279
that's that's a little easier because

277
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,800
you give them equipment you give them

278
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,620
accounts they would like to get paid to

279
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,160
do their job so they'll follow the rules

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,320
As you move into your on-prem data

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,300
center now you have to think about your

282
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,600
system administrators and the developers

283
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,019
what are they allowed to access and how

284
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,180
should they have to prove themselves

285
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,120
plus now maybe you're developing

286
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,000
software for the public or for business

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,519
partners that changes what you can

288
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,779
expect of them

289
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,339
and then when you're using

290
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,740
infrastructure as a service it's for

291
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,540
identity it's going to be pretty similar

292
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,040
to

293
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,899
um

294
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,339
on-prem data center you have to worry

295
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,620
about this is admins and the developers

296
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,180
as well as your users

297
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,000
and then thinking about devices

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,940
this is where it gets a little

299
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,060
mind-blowing so Enterprise it's easy

300
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,519
we're talking laptops mobile phones

301
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,860
things we can touch things we can count

302
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,980
throw in some printers probably some iot

303
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,600
for facility maintenance and

304
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,579
you can eventually enumerate it all

305
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,320
when we're talking about data centers

306
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,440
we're talking about servers in racks

307
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,160
and there are there well there should be

308
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,339
processes for buying new servers and how

309
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,720
to get them in your building and

310
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,860
installed

311
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,820
but they're big things you are you're

312
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,959
going to be able to keep track of them

313
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,000
also

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,060
there's no physical server you're

315
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,700
allowed to touch in infrastructure as a

316
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,260
service

317
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,440
but virtual machines are really just

318
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
servers without the hardware and the

319
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,639
containers are kind of like virtual

320
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,680
machines but they're just really locked

321
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,579
down

322
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,680
so we started looking at these types of

323
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,079
virtual assets virtual machines and

324
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,040
containers as devices in this context

325
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,160
and we actually explicitly leave out

326
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,079
um

327
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,880
end user laptops and mobile phones

328
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,899
because we have no control over them

329
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,760
the general public they bring what they

330
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,480
bring so those get no trust and then we

331
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,579
can think better about how we're going

332
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,800
to trust these the first version of this

333
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
is a maturity model did not explicitly

334
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,300
address

335
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,720
virtual assets it does in V2

336
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,660
so we're like great this is going to be

337
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,540
exciting

338
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,779
so this is what we did to build out our

339
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,480
own framework and while this is a very

340
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,120
good slide to take a picture of at the

341
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,699
very end of the presentation there is

342
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,920
the link for where these slides are

343
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,959
available on GitHub so you can go

344
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,560
download your own copy and look at it

345
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
straight on so when we developed a

346
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,680
framework you know seven easy steps pick

347
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,199
an environment rewrite the maturity

348
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,800
framework that works for your systems

349
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,779
write some questions to help you

350
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,620
determine where different systems will

351
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,260
uh will match the levels for the pillars

352
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,779
and functions get everybody to fill it

353
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,800
out

354
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,380
grade the questionnaire give feedback on

355
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,779
the questionnaire and help them actually

356
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,660
improve their zero trust

357
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,940
maturity that's it

358
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,579
so we started

359
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,220
with our most popular infrastructure as

360
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,620
a service provider

361
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,639
um

362
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,639
mostly because

363
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
even though there are a lot of options

364
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,740
in the cloud

365
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,399
there's a finite number of services that

366
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,740
one of these cloud service providers

367
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,040
will give you unlike your own data

368
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,100
centers where every team has chosen a

369
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,740
different database and maybe a different

370
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,360
operating system and it's going to be a

371
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,459
lot less homogeneous so we went with

372
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,579
infrastructure as a service

373
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,940
and that is where we got started

374
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,220
so I'm going to go through a couple of

375
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,100
examples specific pillars and functions

376
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,860
and how we adjusted the levels and made

377
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,139
them more specific

378
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,720
so I don't actually expect you to be

379
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,639
able to read this slide

380
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,399
um uh each of the different parts are

381
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,779
going to be available in the following

382
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,320
slides so I started in identity because

383
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,600
identity is so crucial to the foundation

384
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
of zero trust

385
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,380
and when we were talking about

386
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,480
Authentication

387
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,100
similar to what I mentioned a couple

388
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,759
slides ago we realized that we want to

389
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,279
look at authentication and identity

390
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
stores differently for developers

391
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,980
and our end users

392
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,600
because of that because of what we can

393
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,420
control and versus what we can't we also

394
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,940
made a third category of authentication

395
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,240
and identity stores for apis because

396
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,220
they too have a different way of

397
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,760
authenticating

398
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
so

399
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,059
cisa starts by recommending

400
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,299
for your traditional that maybe you use

401
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,579
a username and password maybe use some

402
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,299
light multi-factor authentication MFA

403
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,579
and that's all you really take into

404
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,339
account when you authenticate somebody

405
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,440
awesome we're on board with this let's

406
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,980
do it

407
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,340
As you move into the initial phase

408
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,500
you want everyone to be using

409
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,140
multi-factor Authentication

410
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,200
and you also want to start pulling in

411
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
other attributes

412
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,980
so this is where we started being able

413
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,020
to get a little bit more specific so

414
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,299
we're able to say maybe your application

415
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,340
can only be used if you are using sassy

416
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,940
or a device signal is available so sassy

417
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,299
secure access server Edge is a

418
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,700
don't tell Z scalar I said this but it's

419
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,820
a fancy VPN but it's a way to more

420
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,080
specifically broker your network

421
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,600
connections

422
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,620
as we move into advanced

423
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,020
we only want fishing resistant MFA

424
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,940
available so 502 PIV

425
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,799
maybe moving towards a passwordless MF

426
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,260
well passwordless MFA seems a little

427
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,080
strange to think about and we knew that

428
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,940
we wanted to be incorporating more

429
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,700
device level signals or additional perf

430
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,620
and then here well we've already hit the

431
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,720
max

432
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,200
MFA but we're continually looking at our

433
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,760
authentication and when say an attribute

434
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,700
of a user changes we re-evaluate the

435
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,220
authentication so I don't know let's say

436
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,960
your IP address changes in the middle of

437
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,940
your session

438
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,299
that's unusual so we should just do a

439
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,799
real quick authentication and make sure

440
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,120
everything else is still the same

441
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,460
moving into devices I want to highlight

442
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
governance

443
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,140
um deploying MFA

444
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,140
at any level can be a big lift and

445
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,880
there's a lot of people to convince and

446
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,100
you're going to have to buy some stuff

447
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,440
but one of the places that is easier to

448
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,820
get started is wrong governance so

449
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,000
governance is basically

450
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,880
what your policies are how you decided

451
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
on them and how you enforce them so it's

452
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,919
the whole thing so when we talked about

453
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,900
devices

454
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,059
we really started thinking about device

455
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,460
life cycle and in this case we are

456
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,980
talking about device life cycle of

457
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,380
virtual machines and containers

458
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,260
so we were able to remove some of the

459
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,760
language specific to physical devices

460
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,000
in another part like it says sanitize

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,160
here you don't sanitize a virtual

462
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,900
machine that somebody else is running

463
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,559
you just delete it and the company does

464
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,360
the right thing

465
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,020
um

466
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,760
and we also specifically called out

467
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,559
digital Assets in here

468
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,080
as we move into initial we started

469
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,539
setting some expectations you need to

470
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,760
have written down your device lifecycle

471
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
plan

472
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,440
that is a great first step because until

473
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,100
you know the process you can't automate

474
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,940
it

475
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,059
and that's the the future steps so

476
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,860
you have a documented device lifecycle

477
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,260
plan you're implementing it manually

478
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,360
you're doing some sort of monitoring and

479
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,220
scanning of your devices that is

480
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,440
automated say you're running a

481
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,419
vulnerability scanner you take that

482
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,520
information and then you do something

483
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,500
with it

484
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,559
and then we also called out routine

485
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,880
patching

486
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,340
initially you need to be doing at least

487
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,660
monthly

488
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,740
and then we also have a large

489
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,280
um organization capital O within our

490
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,980
cloud service provider and we have a

491
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,640
team that supports making gold images so

492
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,520
you should start using those

493
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,080
um

494
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,140
as we move into advanced

495
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,940
your device life cycle plan we're

496
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,980
starting to implement it automatically

497
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,900
this is where our infrastructure as a

498
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,840
code comes in some of our CI CD

499
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
continuous integration and continuous

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,220
deployment

501
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,020
really comes in we're using gold images

502
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,460
everywhere

503
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,240
are routine patching

504
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,659
now happens at least every two weeks

505
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,620
very strict

506
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,059
and then

507
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,659
our systems are able to tell us when a

508
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,559
device policy is out of line

509
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,120
because when you have a whole bunch of

510
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
virtual machines and you've deployed

511
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
them the same way and one of them looks

512
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,340
weird

513
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,600
that's where you need to go look

514
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,820
and then an optimal everything's

515
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,340
automated we left routine patching at

516
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,220
two weeks because

517
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,440
that's our current expectation in our

518
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
organization and then not only are you

519
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
able to know when something is not in

520
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,919
compliance you're also able to Auto

521
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,620
remediate that device

522
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,320
well probably look something like take

523
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,840
it out of the pool for the application

524
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
to use and maybe snapshot it and keep it

525
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,220
somewhere safe until somebody can look

526
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,520
at it

527
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,960
and then the last one I'll go through is

528
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,280
data data encryption the one of the

529
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,120
maturity model actually in this section

530
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,580
only talked about data at rest

531
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,940
in the network section section rather

532
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,520
they talked about data in transit

533
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,260
but it's all been combined into one here

534
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,240
so

535
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,460
start pretty easy

536
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,280
you only encrypt some of your data at

537
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,880
rest or in transit and every team is

538
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,640
doing something different about how they

539
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,980
manage their keys

540
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
as long as they're not checking them

541
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,419
into GitHub

542
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,780
and then moving into initial

543
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,240
your teams are encrypting all of your

544
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
data at rest

545
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,799
all of it in your

546
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,659
infrastructure and service providers

547
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,159
make it easy to encrypt things even if

548
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,640
you are just using their key encryption

549
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
systems it is better than leaving it

550
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,159
unencrypted

551
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,340
and then we put a parameter here that we

552
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,740
are encrypting all data in transit

553
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,900
outside of the

554
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,120
um infrastructure as a service account

555
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,520
so anything that leaves our little

556
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,900
perimeter

557
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,940
got to be encrypted

558
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,919
and we're starting to talk about how

559
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,860
we're handling our keys

560
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,919
managing them and securing them

561
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,980
moving into advanced

562
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,900
now we're encrypting

563
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,860
all of the data at rest all of the data

564
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,679
in transit within and outside the

565
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,179
accounts and we have like real policies

566
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,179
about how we handle our keys

567
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,640
and then at the end we start getting

568
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,580
into

569
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,500
encrypting our data in use that's kind

570
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,620
of the next Frontier that we're seeing

571
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,860
it's still hard at this point

572
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,559
um but I think I think we're going to

573
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,120
start getting I think it's going to

574
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,380
start getting easier in the next few

575
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,280
years

576
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,640
and then we're using similar processes

577
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
enterprise-wide and we're doing really

578
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,820
smart things with our keys so we're like

579
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,280
sweet we've got this great maturity

580
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,980
model and we had so much fun making it

581
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,360
because we all really love talking about

582
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
zero trust and Security in general so

583
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
we're like how do we find out what

584
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,320
people's maturity is I know let's ask

585
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,620
them so we set up some meetings with a

586
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,900
few teams that I knew better and I was

587
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,419
like Hey read these descriptions and

588
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,179
tell us which one resonates with you

589
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,020
so this wasn't

590
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,020
this wasn't scalable each conversation

591
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,559
was taking two and a half hours

592
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,059
there were at least 100 teams we needed

593
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,360
to talk to and it was fun the first five

594
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,279
times but I could tell it was going to

595
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
get tedious on our side

596
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,480
um so we're like we need to scale this

597
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,580
also if we were asking specific

598
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,080
questions we'd get better answers that

599
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,720
weren't so tied to

600
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,480
I want to get an A on this or I want to

601
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,419
get an advanced or an optimal so

602
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,960
we decided to go with survey questions

603
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,120
but we can't call them surveys because

604
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,580
surveys sound optional within the

605
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,020
federal government when you want people

606
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,659
to tell you things you make it a data

607
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,360
call and then they think you're serious

608
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,340
and you fill it out

609
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,000
so we initially came up with like a 160

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,740
questions and we're like yeah nobody's

611
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,179
gonna answer that

612
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,640
so we got it down to 50 and here are

613
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,059
some examples so we explicitly asked

614
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,039
them what multi-factor authentication

615
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,440
methods are available

616
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,140
and they just take them off and then we

617
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,360
can be like okay you're only using PIV

618
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,659
and 502 awesome you're here anything

619
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,240
else is over here

620
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,039
um same with multi-factor authentication

621
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,380
that helps us differentiate between

622
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,520
traditional and initial

623
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,799
although the secret is we had already

624
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,559
done all of this work before the new

625
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,600
model came out so we're still grading it

626
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,539
on traditional Advanced optimal maybe

627
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,700
next year

628
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,900
for devices for governance we focused on

629
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,299
a device lifecycle plan and patching

630
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,240
and we're starting off real easy do you

631
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,360
have a device lifecycle plan yes no no

632
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,640
that's a really easy area for you to

633
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,840
improve in

634
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,320
for patching we asked a lot we gave a

635
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,299
lot more options partially because I

636
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,760
wanted to see what the range was what

637
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,940
are the options and

638
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,600
um maybe we're able to stiffen up our

639
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,260
maturity model

640
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,240
um so somehow

641
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,400
got a bunch of teams to fill this out

642
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,279
now we need to like tell them how they

643
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,940
did and create some advice on how they

644
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,159
can improve their zero trust maturity

645
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,140
because our application teams really

646
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,960
want to do this they want to be better

647
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,820
they know there's an executive order

648
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,779
they want to be compliant so that's

649
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,080
exciting we need to harness this

650
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
so we made everybody a little chart

651
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,679
all of the pillars across the top their

652
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,320
functions down the side each one got a

653
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,500
score traditional Advanced optimal

654
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,240
and an overall score and we

655
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,620
we made them into numbers and then

656
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,600
transferred them back there were a few

657
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,679
things that we didn't ask enough

658
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
questions for so they couldn't get

659
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,740
scores for them but that's on us not

660
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,640
them

661
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,960
and we also set the expectation that in

662
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,720
order to increase your maturity for a

663
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
specific pillar you just had to increase

664
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,659
your maturity for any of the individual

665
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,640
functions and even though the overall

666
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,460
letter might not change uh we are still

667
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,100
counting that as increased maturity we

668
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,159
also ask them to focus on getting from

669
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
traditional to Advanced to start because

670
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,240
a lot of the things in optimal are

671
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,980
really hard and are going to require

672
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,840
some investment

673
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,059
so everybody got one of those and that's

674
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,480
exciting and then we started looking at

675
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,120
what information do we need to put out

676
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,240
so I looked at which functions have the

677
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,520
most room for improvement

678
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,059
by just using Straight Up average scores

679
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,740
lowest ones most room for improvement

680
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,260
highest ones least room for improvement

681
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,299
even though we're not writing Guidance

682
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,880
just yet on the ones that have the least

683
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,919
room for improvement I wanted to make

684
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,620
sure that we gave ourselves Kudos like

685
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,860
look this area already doing great

686
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,779
we'll get back to it

687
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,000
and then we also wanted to keep in mind

688
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,980
what are things that teams can do

689
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,600
themselves

690
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,919
and what are things that are

691
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,799
team running the infrastructures for

692
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,020
service organization is going to need to

693
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,820
do because those are going to be longer

694
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,279
term problems and we wanted some things

695
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,919
that people could do now so some of them

696
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,960
are easy write your device life cycle

697
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,620
policy down

698
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,779
I also wanted to look at the areas that

699
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,659
were the most different

700
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,960
my theory on that was if there is a high

701
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,480
variance in scores there's not enough

702
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,820
guidance in that area of what we want it

703
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,840
to be doing

704
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,159
and

705
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,340
conversely if there's a low variance

706
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,520
it probably means that we already have a

707
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,460
strong standard for that function and

708
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,539
that actually matches uh

709
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:55,500
what what came out of it so we used just

710
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,679
a simple standard deviation I'm not a

711
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,380
data scientist if you are and have a

712
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,320
better idea of how to measure this and I

713
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,980
can do it in a spreadsheet let me know

714
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,840
um so one of the things that had the

715
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,940
least variance was

716
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,399
uh identity stores well the top two were

717
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,279
identity stores and authentication for

718
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,539
Developers

719
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,740
because we're using a third-party system

720
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,620
to broker our infrastructure as a

721
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,440
service login accounts match it up with

722
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,919
our internal active directory

723
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,520
and almost everybody's using it so sweet

724
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,520
we actually for that one specifically

725
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,580
we're like are you using tool X to log

726
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,860
in your developers they're like yes

727
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,080
awesome we don't need to know answer any

728
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,399
more questions we already know how it's

729
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,760
set up

730
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,779
um yeah and then we started putting

731
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:55,919
these out on our Internal Documentation

732
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,399
so first recap to

733
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,080
Bring It full circle back to more

734
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,480
baseball uh you just need to get a

735
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,299
picture pick your environment tailor the

736
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,580
model create the questions ask the

737
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,820
questions generate some scores

738
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,200
and you've got yourself a home run

739
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,659
so again these were the longer seven

740
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,360
steps that will probably be easier to

741
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,220
explain to your co-workers

742
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,899
what we did

743
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:29,479
or what you might want to do for this

744
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,179
um

745
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,760
and

746
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,360
as a charge to inspire you

747
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
we ended up with some 40 functions

748
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,279
across all five pillars that's a lot of

749
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,039
things to improve across a lot of

750
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,840
applications

751
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,059
and some parts of zero trust take a lot

752
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,220
of time if you are going to be moving to

753
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,980
passwordless authentication which by the

754
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,320
way is awesome

755
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,140
if you don't have a password how can it

756
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,520
get fished

757
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,159
right

758
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,340
but that can take years to do you need

759
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,179
money you need you need Executive Suite

760
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,299
level support

761
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,980
deploying continuous Diagnostics and

762
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,080
monitoring tools and endpoint detection

763
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,299
response on every device also takes a

764
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,260
while

765
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,000
fully micro segmenting your network

766
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,899
network

767
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,380
great to do

768
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,559
also requires a lot of time and buy-in

769
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,220
real-time risk analytics a lot of time

770
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,620
completely automated data inventory and

771
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,640
tagging

772
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
oof

773
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,620
also more time uh have you seen the

774
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,940
bills for any of the like

775
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,580
infrastructures of service like machine

776
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,559
learning tagging

777
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,140
you're going to need more money

778
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,480
um but there are some things you can do

779
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,200
now with what you have

780
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,960
and I firmly believe that incremental

781
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,559
progress builds momentum

782
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,100
so what is one thing that your

783
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,099
organization can do to improve in each

784
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,719
pillar

785
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,179
if you are using a centralized identity

786
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,699
management service

787
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,918
encourage teams to turn on additional

788
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,859
multi-factor authentication options

789
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,899
and then for the ones that have smaller

790
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,760
user populations that you have more

791
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,700
control over maybe turn some of them off

792
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,418
make sure everyone has a device

793
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,099
lifecycle plan

794
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,719
and an explicit patching Cadence with

795
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,299
exceptions for very important things

796
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,780
add encryption to data in transit within

797
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,960
your infrastructure accounts

798
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,599
um that could be researching some

799
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,918
service service mesh and mutual TLS

800
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,480
options

801
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,119
and

802
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,500
there are also uh instructions out there

803
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,680
I think for I would assume for each of

804
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,220
the major providers to tell you how to

805
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,260
encrypt your connections to their

806
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,359
services so like from your VMS to your

807
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,880
database service encrypt that too

808
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,040
keep your data safe

809
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,839
you're going to want to standardize

810
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,880
expectations for static application

811
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,240
security testing and then

812
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,240
make sure you have encryption

813
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,839
at your for your data at rest in all

814
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,880
your infrastructures and service

815
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,060
accounts I forgot a huge point which was

816
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,640
you might have noticed I didn't ask any

817
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,619
questions about encryption

818
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,599
that's because we're a federal agency

819
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,060
and every quarter we have to tell our

820
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,720
bosses how we're doing on that so I

821
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
could go look it up so I didn't ask any

822
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
questions they don't have to remember we

823
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,940
also maybe use a tool from our

824
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,060
um infrastructure provider that helps us

825
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,520
check our configurations to find out

826
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,619
whether or not they're in compliance so

827
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,300
we can also see which ones are encrypted

828
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,000
and which ones are not

829
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,260
uh

830
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,720
yeah encrypt your stuff

831
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,320
um it's not it's standard now and pretty

832
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,119
easy to do and isn't going to cost you a

833
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,200
lot extra

834
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,220
so

835
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,500
particularly your document store buckets

836
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,619
that you could accidentally make public

837
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,079
because encrypted ones accidentally made

838
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,160
public way less of a breach than

839
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,300
unencrypted ones

840
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,920
so

841
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,240
I have some time left

842
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,839
excellent my contact information is up

843
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,420
there

844
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,740
unfortunately in order to email me at my

845
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,900
work accounts you have to figure out how

846
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,640
to spell my last name

847
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,119
only my parents can email me

848
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,060
and then my slides are available on my

849
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,579
GitHub eshwine Dash usds decks it's my

850
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,099
only public repo right now so

851
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,540
um yeah so the slides that are up there

852
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,380
I would not recommend using with a

853
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,760
screen reader but hopefully in the next

854
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,220
couple of days I'll get those up and now

855
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,859
I will take questions until they play me

856
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,440
off oh so many hands I'm going to go way

857
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,099
in the back first

858
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,119
yep

859
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,260
oh that is a great question so

860
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,980
um

861
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,359
I'm sorry

862
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,520
yes that is a great question the

863
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,619
question was

864
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,599
um you talk about the pillars and there

865
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,599
are the three cross-cutting functions

866
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,180
how were you looking at visibility and

867
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,540
analytics across all of the pillars and

868
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,780
one of the things we did in specific was

869
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,839
the questions get repetitive real quick

870
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,140
when you're like are you logging X how

871
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,400
can you analyze X so we actually made a

872
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
separate like visibility and analytics

873
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,720
section and then had people check off

874
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,180
like which areas they were looking at so

875
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,119
um are you doing it for your virtual

876
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,480
machines and containers are you doing it

877
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,160
at your firewalls are you doing it

878
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,660
along the way so that is how we handled

879
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,480
that

880
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,619
I believe the next one was you sir

881
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,170
[Music]

882
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,040
did we use numerical scoring and uh

883
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,320
visualization for executives

884
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,920
yep

885
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,520
did we weight things differently so we

886
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,560
did some numeric scores

887
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,140
um roughly

888
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,500
traditional was a one advances to

889
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,420
Optimal is three for the new system

890
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,180
we're gonna push traditional down to

891
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,940
zero initial will be one

892
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,859
um and

893
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:44,040
we haven't done a lot of reporting up

894
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,500
words and we actually haven't done very

895
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,420
much reporting

896
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,859
um across like across many projects so

897
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,260
we thought about doing a heat map but we

898
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,500
kind of decided not to in this stage we

899
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,740
might in a future version

900
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,060
um and we did give numerical scores for

901
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,359
the overall pillar score

902
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,280
we also will graph it on a radiograph

903
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,079
so each

904
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,859
radiograph has more than two axes it'll

905
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,700
have a kind of like a spider web

906
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,200
so you can get a better sense of like

907
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,480
how much are you filling in

908
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,300
make sense awesome and then in the front

909
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,800
yeah

910
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,619
so the answer or the question was

911
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,380
um for Behavior analytics which is a big

912
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,440
part of how we do these things for

913
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,740
things like probably identity are you uh

914
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,780
I mentioned one in specific like

915
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,780
location are they also doing

916
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,200
um uh time of day and some other things

917
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,060
and

918
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,700
right now all of that is being done in

919
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,220
our identity systems we only have a

920
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,460
couple so we haven't really looked at

921
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,320
exactly what's going on there and how to

922
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,359
make it better partially because we need

923
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,740
to do an upgrade

924
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,780
but also

925
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:42,359
it's hard and having come from a multi

926
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:43,859
well couple different Giant

927
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,740
multinationals

928
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,440
what does time of days look like when

929
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,280
somebody goes between the U.S and Europe

930
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,359
a lot

931
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,220
it's a lot easier here because almost

932
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,400
all of our employees are in the greater

933
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,260
Baltimore area

934
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,480
um yeah so we haven't gotten too much

935
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,220
into the real analytics because I'm uh

936
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,960
because we don't have those the right

937
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,880
tools yet

938
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,859
yeah sweet in the vest

939
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,240
okay did I work with any other agencies

940
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,380
in developing this and are there any

941
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,440
processes that are shareable uh

942
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,500
we haven't yet worked with other

943
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,200
agencies other than

944
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,619
um what I do in one of my side quests

945
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:48,619
but we are getting to that point now so

946
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:50,700
centers for Medicare Medicaid services

947
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,260
falls under HHS we have our own zero

948
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,540
trust group so I'm starting to talk to

949
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,540
them and CMS is one of the bigger

950
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,540
agencies some of them are pretty tiny so

951
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,359
I'm like hey let me double check like I

952
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,800
will give you our process and tools

953
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,859
the tool was a spreadsheet

954
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,740
with some other spreadsheets

955
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,780
um so yeah that is that is our next step

956
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,960
uh talking about it more and figuring

957
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,400
out what the best way to transfer those

958
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,200
knowledge is

959
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,540
and then we'll do it for more

960
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,740
infrastructure as a service providers

961
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,599
because we've got two Cloud providers

962
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,339
and it's gonna be a fun time

963
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,480
um

964
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,380
yes

965
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,540
um so the question was when you were

966
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,880
coming up with a questionnaire are you

967
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,740
also working with Auditors to confirm

968
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,220
that these answers that is our end goal

969
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,460
uh particularly with the cloud the cloud

970
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,380
providers write down everything you do

971
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,740
so they can charge you for it

972
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,099
um so we should be using that data and

973
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,140
that is

974
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,359
um that is our goal our end goal to make

975
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:27,180
sure that we are collecting it and can

976
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,119
calculate it but we did need to do it by

977
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,060
hand first so

978
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,520
um yeah yeah so that's going to be very

979
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,400
exciting we did work with a survey

980
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,800
design well a designer

981
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,720
who also knew something about survey

982
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,359
design which was actually really great

983
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,500
for like mediating conflict between the

984
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,900
different Security Experts and like what

985
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,540
we should ask and making sure that our

986
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,800
sentences

987
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,619
were understandable by people who aren't

988
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,940
really into zero trust

989
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,660
anything else I think we might be almost

990
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,440
out of time

991
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,700
yeah what are one or two things that are

992
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,280
slowing people down

993
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,980
in progressing in their maturity

994
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,300
um

995
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,119
I mean the biggest one I think is

996
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,260
particularly because we're a federal

997
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,040
agency is going to be money a lot of

998
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,760
these things cost money and

999
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,740
um

1000
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,319
were the budget for 2024 is already set

1001
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,240
so I hope we thought of this a couple

1002
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,740
months ago

1003
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,799
um

1004
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,619
one of the other the other biggest thing

1005
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,380
is just knowing what to do and having

1006
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,680
somebody else help prioritize it so one

1007
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,000
of our bigger systems had an external

1008
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,460
contractor come in and do a similar type

1009
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,319
of assessment and I'm like that's great

1010
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,819
because

1011
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,800
they need somebody who can really like
