1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
foreign

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:21,480
[Music]

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,180
so I I told Dr Green after his keynote

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,980
this morning this actually is gonna his

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,720
talk was not gonna be the only crypto

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
means cryptology talk so

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Buckle in because we're doing we're

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,760
going way back to when when Taylor Swift

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,940
wasn't born for 75 years so I'm going a

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,620
little further back than than Dr Green

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,719
went

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,020
and and the reality is uh that this

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,559
story the story is really a love story

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:50,760
and

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,739
it's a love story that kind of begins

16
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,039
and ends with a pretty powerful concept

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,199
a concept that what really makes a

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,660
person powerful isn't anything in the

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,359
traditional senses of power but not in

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
you know strength or Force but that

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,159
knowledge uh knowledge itself is power

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,920
and that's actually a quote from uh

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,420
Francis Bacon who was an English

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,240
philosopher uh and Statesman who lived

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,400
in the 17th century uh the time of

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
Shakespeare the time of the colonization

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,720
of North America and when the

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,220
foundations of a lot of really modern

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,799
science uh was being laid

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,880
and yes Francis Bacon is the uh bacon in

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,220
the title of this presentation so I'm

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,900
sorry to disappoint any bacon lovers

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
that were expecting something a little

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,140
different but

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,439
uh hopefully it's okay and while Bacon's

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,240
quote is kind of the beginning of our

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,100
story it also ends with that same quote

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
on a tombstone of a man named William

39
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,020
Freeman and then again our story isn't

40
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,759
really about William but about his

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,399
better half in many ways Elizabeth Smith

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:54,780
Friedman

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,079
and Elizabeth is the one who decided to

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,600
place knowledge's power on the tombstone

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
that was her husband's Tombstone and

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,420
would be hers too the end of her life

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,619
later

48
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,439
and she also put in that quote a secret

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,419
code uh code that reminded her of how

50
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,280
they met how they ended up spending

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,500
their lives together lives that saw the

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,959
foundation of a different modern science

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,440
cryptology spoiler alert and the one

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
that you and I rely on every day right

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
that one that's Central to everything we

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,459
do and how we secure ourselves like Dr

57
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,260
Green talked about this morning

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,140
how do we secure ourselves our knowledge

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,239
really from those who would seek to gain

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,560
its power

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,840
so before I introduce myself I'd like to

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,239
introduce Elizabeth Smith it is

63
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,360
Elizabeth spelled with two e's and no a

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,340
uh she was the youngest of nine Smith

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,900
children and the theory goes that her

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,860
mother kind of wanted to give her

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,140
something when your last name Smith

68
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,459
you don't really have anything so she

69
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,900
got an illusion unusual spelling of

70
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,780
Elizabeth to help set her apart she was

71
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,680
born in a small town in Indiana uh

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,840
raised on a Farm by her Quaker Dairy

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
farming father and mother

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
and his her father could actually Trace

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
his lineage all the way back to an

76
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,900
English Quaker who sailed to America in

77
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,040
1682 on the same boat as William Penn of

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,780
state north of us Fame

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,940
and from a young age she knew she wanted

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,680
to do something different than the

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,420
ordinary she didn't want the

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,099
pre-prescribed life for herself she

83
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,900
wanted to break with tradition break the

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,480
mold kind of plot her own course

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,580
a letter early to defy her father's

86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,280
wishes and attend college and even after

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,379
that the prescribed path for her at that

88
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,760
point would have been well teaching at

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
the high school level and you know

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,599
living at home that didn't work out of

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,580
her out for her so she left and headed

92
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,040
to Chicago hoping to find their job

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,360
there doing something interesting

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,900
something unusual and boy did she ever

95
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,760
and so I'm really excited to talk to you

96
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,220
today about that story my name is

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,040
Brendan and yeah it's also spelled in an

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,739
interesting way and this is actually the

99
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,980
first b-sides that I've ever attended so

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,480
back in December I was given the

101
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,280
opportunity to join a company called

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,260
project Discovery where the makers of

103
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,060
open source security tools like nuclei

104
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,239
and SubFinder and httpx and many others

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,920
and I was really excited to join this

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,760
community

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,500
I spent most of my career up until now

108
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,779
in developer tooling most recently I was

109
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,279
at a company called gitlab for five

110
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,160
years and that led me to see the power

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,440
that open source can bring to bear on

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,060
problems that real practitioners face

113
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,880
not just the ones that look good in a

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,699
demo or sell really well from one person

115
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,040
in a suit to another person in a suit so

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
I hope that you'll indulge me a little

117
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,180
bit here with Elizabeth's story I

118
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,280
promise if you stick around I'll apply

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,600
it back to our day-to-day lives and

120
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
working to secure ourselves and our

121
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,300
organizations

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,800
I just also think there's something

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,020
special to be learned from the history

124
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,360
of what Elizabeth did what part she

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,460
actually didn't get credit to credit for

126
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,160
until very recently and even how she

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
came to do in the first place

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,580
so how she came to do it in the first

129
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,380
place is Elizabeth was always interested

130
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,080
in history and language and she learned

131
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,660
that in Chicago at an obscure Library a

132
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,919
private Library called the Newberry

133
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,840
Library there was a rare and unique

134
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,540
piece of History called the first folium

135
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,820
so you see in Shakespeare's time the

136
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,680
spoken word was valued much higher than

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,840
the written word and so while he was

138
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,300
alive actually none of his plays were

139
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,979
recorded and printed in any meaningful

140
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:23,759
way

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,620
and it wasn't until seven years after

142
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,240
his death that a group of admirers

143
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
gathered 36 of his Works into a

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
published book and the act of publishing

145
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,860
that first folio was in and of itself a

146
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,320
radical act right to suggest that some

147
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
mere mortal man like Shakespeare

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,220
deserved the same treatment and

149
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,780
preservation that was at that time

150
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,600
really only preserved for the Bible

151
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,180
so not many copies of this first folio

152
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,780
existed and in the early 1900s uh the

153
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,039
Newberry Library had one of the few

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,479
copies available in America and

155
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,580
Elizabeth's curiosity and desire for

156
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,699
something new drove her to go see it and

157
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,199
that would start this chain of events

158
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,020
that led to the foundation of a science

159
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
when Elizabeth got to the library she

160
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,860
started talking to a librarian about you

161
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,479
know the folio and what Elizabeth wanted

162
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,940
to do next in her life and the librarian

163
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
remembered this eccentric millionaire

164
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,180
who was looking for someone just like

165
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,259
Elizabeth

166
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,479
and within the next hour George Fabian

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
showed up in the limousine absconded

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,440
with Elizabeth took her to a train

169
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,600
station led her all the way to his

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,340
estate in Geneva Illinois which was

171
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,960
called Riverbank

172
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,139
and at Riverbank Fabian uh here had

173
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,600
assembled uh scientists and inquisitive

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,180
Minds from all over the country and he

175
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,620
was footing the bill as they

176
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,840
experimented with a wide-ranging set of

177
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,220
activities from uh botany to genetics to

178
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,680
Acoustics and most critically to

179
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,259
Elizabeth one of fabian's most prized

180
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,199
projects was involved the first folio

181
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,479
and a theory about the true author of

182
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,699
Shakespeare's masterpieces

183
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,259
you see a riverbank there was this other

184
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,720
woman Mrs Elizabeth Wells Gallup with

185
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,060
the traditional Za Elizabeth rather than

186
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,539
Elizabeth R Elizabeth Ze she ran a

187
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,100
school called the riverbank Cipher

188
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,000
School

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,919
and a cipher of course is a secret or

190
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,380
disguised way of writing you know some

191
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900
sort of code and Mrs Gallup had been

192
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,479
working for years on a secret code that

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,280
she believed was embedded in the first

194
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,680
folio a secret code that if proven

195
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,300
correct would have changed our

196
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,039
understanding of not only English

197
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,199
literature but of the history of the

198
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,060
United Kingdom itself as well

199
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,039
so here we're going to take a little

200
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,900
detour there's lots of detours on this

201
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,240
road today sorry to talk about the

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
cipher method that Mrs Gallup was

203
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,599
pressure was was pursuing and looking

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,300
for in the first folio so in his time

205
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,280
Francis Bacon had actually revealed that

206
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
he invented a new type of Cipher a

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,780
method to Signal what he called Omnia

208
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,360
per Omnia anything by anything

209
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,220
so the Insight led him to the discovery

210
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,479
that you know you could have this

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,039
ability to represent all the letters of

212
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,380
the alphabet using only two letters if

213
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,599
you combine them in permutations of five

214
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,860
letter blocks

215
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,740
and at the time his time uh I and J and

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,740
and unw were interchangeable so

217
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,780
um the bacon alphabet looked something

218
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,039
like this

219
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,080
and I was going to make two slides but

220
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,560
that was hard but yes this also then is

221
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,300
the part of the theory that led Claude

222
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,180
Shannon much later to come to refine our

223
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,340
modern view of information theory that

224
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,039
binary code zeros and ones could be used

225
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,419
to represent

226
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,879
all of the world's data and in fact

227
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,399
interestingly enough

228
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,559
1916 was the year that Shannon was born

229
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,260
that's also the year that Elizabeth

230
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,419
showed up at Riverbank so history kind

231
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,039
of has a lot of those fun little little

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,799
uh notes but that's another digression

233
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,680
so Mrs Gallup believed that uh and had

234
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,080
written actually an entire book that in

235
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,000
the first folio the printers had

236
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,339
intentionally used an A and B form of

237
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,620
letters through you know differences in

238
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,839
how they printed the letters to embed

239
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,180
this bacon Cipher into the document

240
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,260
itself

241
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,300
and she had produced many pages

242
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,779
translating this by literal ciphertext

243
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,180
into real text and what she found really

244
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,920
Disturbed her and actually made

245
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
headlines in the day

246
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,800
um

247
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,620
see she found uh that Francis Bacon

248
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,540
himself was actually the author of all

249
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,980
of The Works attributed to Shakespeare

250
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,959
and other authors and that he was

251
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,459
actually the illegitimate son of Queen

252
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,680
Elizabeth and thus the rightful heir to

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,420
the throne of England

254
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,160
and Mrs Gallup had been doing this work

255
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,680
for 20 years by this point and there

256
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,940
were a lot of people that believed this

257
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,820
Theory throughout history so Mark Twain

258
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,800
Nathaniel Hawthorne they believe that

259
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
this was possible but proof had always

260
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,120
been Elusive and Mrs Gallup thought she

261
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,220
had that proof a scientific method of

262
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,680
determining this a versus B form of the

263
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,720
letters and it was a and that she had

264
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
done it in a reproducible way but what

265
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,500
she needed was someone to reproduce it

266
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,899
which is where Elizabeth came in

267
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,940
so Mrs Gallup would set her to work

268
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,519
trying to reproduce those results with

269
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,040
kind of this vague and honestly hard to

270
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,300
understand description of what the

271
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,580
biformed alphabet was like there's this

272
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,560
slight difference in the stem of an H or

273
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,200
the tilt of the oval of a g is more or

274
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,820
less in this form

275
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,459
and so Elizabeth at the time in her

276
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,140
diary likened it to trying to sort

277
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,959
blueberries by color or beach pebbles by

278
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,980
smoothness

279
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,140
uh and she needed Mrs gallup's help to

280
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,660
even get the first 24 word translation

281
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,779
done but from there she was sent out to

282
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,580
go on her own and try to reproduce all

283
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,980
these results and for weeks she

284
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,380
continued in this work right she tried

285
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,660
her best to interpret Miss gallup's uh

286
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,360
notes and what she had created and while

287
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,220
this was tedious work she was enjoying

288
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,260
the cool Illinois summer and got to meet

289
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,600
all these nice cool people doing the

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
stuff at Ware Riverbank and met a man

291
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,040
named William Friedman who was an

292
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,540
aspiring geneticist who was Raising

293
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,399
fruit flies to try and understand the

294
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,100
role of genes in various traits and

295
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,260
again this is 40 years before the

296
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,300
discovery of the double helix of DNA so

297
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,519
you know relatively new and

298
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,079
groundbreaking science

299
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
so Elizabeth and William had this kind

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,620
of instant friendship one that they

301
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,180
cultivated on weekends and in between

302
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,399
their work they understood one another

303
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,620
they trusted another in one another's

304
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,880
intellect in a way that was different

305
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,680
than other folks that they were friends

306
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,120
with at Riverbank

307
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,940
and most of the folks at Riverbank were

308
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,040
content to kind of you know be paid to

309
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,720
do interesting work and not ask too many

310
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
questions

311
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,500
uh William was aware of this first folio

312
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,959
Cipher project as well because he was

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,180
the resident photographer and so he was

314
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,140
the one that had to make the

315
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,640
enlargements of the folio that Mrs

316
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,959
Gallup was making

317
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,579
uh and he was also fascinated with

318
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,060
ciphers he put hidden messages in

319
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,920
sketches that he made

320
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,540
um that would then look like any other

321
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,940
Botanical illustration but would have

322
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,380
like hidden words like bacon and

323
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,760
Shakespeare in them

324
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,399
and as summer turned to autumn and

325
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,320
winter Elizabeth knew that William and

326
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,720
her were growing a lot closer but she

327
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,940
was unsure of what to call it but this

328
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,740
growing closeness led her to build up

329
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,140
the courage to share something that she

330
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,000
had been thinking about for months

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
something that had been kind of eating

332
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,540
away to her and something that was very

333
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,420
sacrilegious to even think at Riverbank

334
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,279
much less share out loud

335
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,140
and that's the reality that there are no

336
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,540
hidden messages in Shakespeare

337
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,640
Elizabeth was revealed to find that

338
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,160
William shared the same doubt you know

339
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,899
they were they talked together but what

340
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,760
if everyone involved in the bacon idea

341
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,279
was was you know delusional except for

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,600
them what would that mean for their work

343
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,220
and their lives together

344
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,959
but before they had time to figure that

345
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,740
out

346
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,600
a much more pressing matter came to

347
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,760
change the course of their lives

348
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,320
so at 11 A.M on February 27 1917 the

349
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,700
Secretary of State at the time Robert

350
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,740
Lanson carried a copy of an intercepted

351
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,839
telegram that had made its way up the

352
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,240
chain to in Washington after arriving

353
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,220
from London to show it to president

354
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,860
would President Woodrow Wilson

355
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,220
uh Wilson's only response was good Lord

356
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,680
so this telegram had been sent from

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,380
Germany to Mexico a month before and was

358
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,300
encoded in numeric blocks kind of like

359
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,740
this you can see it here

360
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,899
and when it was translated it took about

361
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,760
a month for the British code breaking

362
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
team to translate it they found a

363
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,200
conspiracy against the United States of

364
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,100
America

365
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,019
whoops went too far

366
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,779
so sent by the German ambassadors or

367
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,339
sorry the German Empire's foreign

368
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,560
secretary Arthur Zimmerman to the German

369
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,420
ambassador in Mexico

370
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,860
the telegram would later be known

371
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,079
colloquially as the Zimmerman Telegram

372
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,399
and it proposed that if the United

373
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
States entered the War uh World War One

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
on the side of the Allies that Mexico

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,060
should join the Central Powers and be

376
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,639
Germany's Ally in return Germany would

377
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,620
help Mexico with financial support in

378
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,660
order to regain the territories that it

379
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,220
had lost to the United States so that

380
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,279
included Texas New Mexico and Arizona

381
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,899
previously the United States had been

382
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,420
neutral in the conflict but the proposal

383
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
of this alliance between Germany and

384
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,899
Mexico which introduced the possibility

385
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,820
of an attack directly on the United

386
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,220
States outraged the American public and

387
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,959
led to a big shift in public opinion

388
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,639
towards entering the war on the side of

389
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,779
the allies

390
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,579
and President Wilson used this telegram

391
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,500
the Zimmerman Telegram as justification

392
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,899
for asking Congress to declare war on

393
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,560
Germany in April 1917.

394
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,540
and the revelation of the Zimmerman

395
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,700
Telegram had a lasting impact on

396
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,920
international relations it demonstrated

397
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,899
the importance of cryptology and code

398
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,459
breaking and warfare

399
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,320
and George Fabian at the time in

400
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,540
Riverbank Labs had the only code

401
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,880
breaking school and team William and the

402
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,940
soon to be Mrs Friedman Elizabeth Smith

403
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,680
and this is the moment that Elizabeth

404
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
hadn't known but had been waiting for

405
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
the moment that defines the rest of her

406
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,019
life the fact that she was able to trust

407
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,959
herself at 23 years old to trust her

408
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,839
instincts about this code doesn't launch

409
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,579
a thousand ships but does eventually

410
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,339
save thousands of lives on ships it

411
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,779
leads to the birth not only of the

412
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,279
Freeman's eventual children but the

413
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,680
birth of a new science science that we

414
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,540
take for granted today

415
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,519
you know cryptology touches every aspect

416
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,139
of our lives and most humans interact

417
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,540
with it unknowingly but at the start of

418
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,160
the first World War

419
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
uh for the United States Elizabeth and

420
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,880
William were maybe were two of maybe a

421
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,560
handful literally a handful of people

422
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,360
who understood enough about cryptology

423
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
to even start looking at encrypted

424
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,300
messages

425
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,399
and Fabian is quick to volunteer river

426
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,980
river bank in Elizabeth and William to

427
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,440
the war effort in previous conflicts

428
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,720
code Breakers hadn't mattered that much

429
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,620
right because before the days of radio

430
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,720
transmission and Telegraph Etc if you

431
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,100
wanted to intercept a military message

432
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,620
you had to you know capture the

433
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,139
messenger on Horseback right or maybe

434
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,660
exploit the postal system in a you know

435
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,579
simple way

436
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,560
but this Great War was different than

437
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,420
previous ones because radio allowed

438
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,800
Wireless Communications over great

439
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,079
distances and then it also enabled

440
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,899
anyone with a radio and a receiver to

441
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,220
pick up those messages that you were

442
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,240
sending

443
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,920
so this meant that powers on both sides

444
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,959
of the war were also fighting to find

445
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,760
the best ciphers and methods to encrypt

446
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,500
what they were sending

447
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,120
and that's where Elizabeth and William

448
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,160
came in they were placed in charge of

449
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,320
the riverbank division of ciphers and

450
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,360
they would together not only become the

451
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,279
main source of decrypting enemy messages

452
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,860
for the United States but also create

453
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,019
some of the seminal works that serve as

454
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,459
the foundation for this type of work

455
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,199
which they actually coined the term

456
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,199
cryptanalyst to describe it in decoding

457
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
coded messages

458
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
the riverbank Publications most of which

459
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,899
they worked on together even though only

460
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,820
a few mentioned Elizabeth as a co-author

461
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,579
codified a lot of the knowledge that

462
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,320
they gained through their hard study

463
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,720
about the frequencies of letters and

464
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,120
letter groupings in languages the index

465
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,579
of coincidence and various methods to

466
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,860
get around ciphers of the time that were

467
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,120
you know all documented in these

468
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,620
Publications

469
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,759
and these methods are the very

470
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,680
foundations of cryptology right take for

471
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,560
example one of the simplest ciphers a

472
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,899
mono alphabetic substitution Cipher or

473
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,880
mask right so this is one where you

474
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,639
change one letter for another so in this

475
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,140
example for the English alphabet you

476
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,040
change a to X B to y c to Z Etc

477
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,780
it's one of the most basic ciphers you

478
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,939
can think of it's mono alphabetic

479
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,859
because the alphabet stays the same for

480
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,000
the entire message

481
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,040
and these type of software ciphers can

482
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,480
be found you know even dating back to

483
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,040
the time of Caesar there's even a

484
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,140
specific type of monoalphabetic Cipher a

485
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,400
name for Caesar

486
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
but even the simplest method of ciphers

487
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,059
there are 403 septillion possible

488
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,679
alphabets that you can create with this

489
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,780
type of Cipher that's on the order of 10

490
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,480
to the 24th power or roughly on par with

491
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,679
the number of stars in the known

492
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
universe roughly rough enough so a

493
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,620
number this large means that a thousand

494
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,360
computers testing a million alphabets a

495
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,100
second would take more than a billion

496
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
years to try and solve for every

497
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,240
possible alphabet yet this is also the

498
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,679
kind of Cipher that you'd find on like

499
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,840
the back of a Cracker Jack box or a

500
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,340
puzzle in the newspaper so so given the

501
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,840
right conditions even an inexperienced

502
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,580
person can solve this kind of Cipher so

503
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,200
how is that even possible

504
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
what's possible because we can start to

505
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,679
identify the patterns right this is the

506
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,539
incidence of code breaking and it's

507
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,160
something that humans have evolved to be

508
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,500
very very good at doing right taking

509
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,840
what appears to be chaotic input and

510
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,940
finding patterns in the chaos

511
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,620
this is the most important skill of a

512
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,720
code breaker at least definitely the

513
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,740
most important skill at the time of

514
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,840
Elizabeth and William it's not pure math

515
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,820
skills it's you know Elizabeth was a

516
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,860
poet William was a was a botanist by

517
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,720
training but their ability to pay

518
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,760
attention to look for and see patterns

519
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,620
in what appears to be a chaotic

520
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,240
patternless environment

521
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,100
and I'm going to return to that idea of

522
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,900
patterns but I'm going to keep talking

523
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
through Elizabeth and William's wartime

524
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,740
efforts for for a few minutes more

525
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,360
so their efforts in World War One were

526
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,100
actually very well documented especially

527
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,179
with the publication of that

528
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,440
foundational research we were talking

529
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,160
about

530
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,900
in fact for the first eight months of

531
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,440
the war Riverbank did 100 all of the

532
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,940
code breaking for every part of the

533
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,200
United States government the state

534
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,299
department the war department the Navy

535
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,340
the Department of Justice

536
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,960
and not only that they would go on to

537
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,120
then be the main training ground when

538
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,100
those various departments decided they

539
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,240
wanted to kind of expand their own

540
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,520
in-house code breaking capabilities

541
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,020
you know code breaking and code making

542
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,360
were invading every part of their lives

543
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,440
together

544
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,600
so even here this is a picture of them

545
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,299
at one of those training classes they

546
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,100
actually embedded a secret code in this

547
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,620
picture in the style of you guessed it

548
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,780
Francis Bacon and a b Cypher where the

549
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,160
folks with their heads turned at an

550
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,200
angle right it looks kind of weird got

551
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,520
some folks with their heads turned away

552
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,580
are the B form and then this isn't the

553
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,020
whole photograph the photographs wider

554
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,120
but the entire photograph spells out

555
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,860
knowledge is power famous break and

556
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,660
phrase

557
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,820
so then after the war as the government

558
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,160
continued to see you know what code

559
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
breaking meant in a modern world

560
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,520
Elizabeth and William would actually

561
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,760
leave Riverbank and find new careers in

562
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,720
this field

563
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,580
she would go work for the Coast Guard

564
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,960
which at the time was part of the

565
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,679
Department of the treasury and in 1927

566
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,539
when the government came knocking and

567
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,520
asked her help with a new challenge and

568
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,900
that challenge was that during

569
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,419
prohibition illegal alcohol smuggling

570
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,100
and distribution became a very lucrative

571
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,679
business for organized crime groups uh

572
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,419
so to invade law enforcement these

573
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,760
groups would use sophisticated codes and

574
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,500
ciphers in their Communications with

575
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,700
their boats as they were doing rum

576
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,080
running up from the South America

577
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
typically

578
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
and the Coast Guard was uniquely

579
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,299
positioned to help with this because

580
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,160
they had listening stations on the coast

581
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,980
and then Elizabeth's talents uh were

582
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,280
critical in deciphering analyzing uh the

583
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,780
messages that were there and exposing

584
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,640
actually a number of critic uh criminal

585
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,460
networks and disrupting operations

586
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,559
she also was involved in apprehending

587
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,260
major crime figures and provided crucial

588
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,539
evidence in numerous legal cases

589
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,520
her work led to successful prosecution

590
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,679
of lots of bootlegging operations

591
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,740
including one later run by John F

592
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,059
Kennedy's father

593
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,220
and she decrypted radio Transmissions

594
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,200
between the ships and their criminal

595
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,780
Associates to prove uh the guilt of many

596
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,760
of these folks

597
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,500
and throughout her tenure at the Coast

598
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,440
Guard Friedman played a critical role in

599
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,880
shaping that agency's intelligence

600
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,220
capabilities and establishing its

601
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,440
reputation for counterintelligence

602
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,480
laying the work for modern day code

603
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
breaking and her reputation was growing

604
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,340
as her reputation grew right newspapers

605
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,780
started to feature prominently right

606
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,100
because she was testifying these public

607
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,200
cases they taught referred to her as

608
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,059
America's first female cryptanalyst or

609
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,100
highlighted her critical role in

610
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,740
Breaking seemingly impenetrable codes

611
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,299
and they were also full of a lot of

612
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,340
focus on her as middle-aged which she

613
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,320
really resented and almost always

614
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,179
involved the word pretty like pretty

615
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,000
code breaking ladies somewhere in there

616
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,500
um so Elizabeth's Fame in the Press

617
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,480
during this period helped kind of Raise

618
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,700
This importance of cryptanalysts you

619
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
know in law enforcement and natural

620
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,159
security

621
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,840
and it also overshadowed what William

622
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,640
was doing at the time working for the

623
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Army and William was always tormented by

624
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
this fact that his hands were kind of

625
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,600
tied when it came to sharing his work

626
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,740
and at the same time Elizabeth was

627
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,419
tormented by this press that she was

628
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,559
getting that wasn't always the most

629
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,720
flattering or focusing on the right

630
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,120
things and she was trying to raise a

631
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,559
young family

632
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,539
but soon their roles would actually flip

633
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,280
and Elizabeth would happily Fade Into

634
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,539
the background

635
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,460
but that change also meant that her

636
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,140
amazing accomplishments in the next

637
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,840
World War would be overshadowed for many

638
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,760
years by her husband's efforts in

639
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,039
founding a National Security Agency but

640
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
in some ways Elizabeth's work in World

641
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,419
War II is even more unbelievable than

642
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,039
Williams

643
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,440
so during World War II her expertise was

644
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,320
pivotal in identifying and apprehending

645
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,539
Nazi spies and the description of their

646
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,620
messages

647
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,659
and this work was instrumental not only

648
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,179
once the US entered the war but before

649
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,679
they entered the war

650
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,179
so in the Years leading up to the U.S

651
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,159
entering and entering the war

652
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,140
Elizabeth worked closely with British

653
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,419
intelligence sharing her knowledge and

654
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,419
assisting them uh because there was a

655
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,640
huge Nazi spy ring in South America at

656
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,419
the time

657
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,179
and so she contributed significantly to

658
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,880
the exposure and capture of lots of

659
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,220
enemy agents all throughout the Western

660
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,299
Hemisphere

661
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,280
and during this period it was called the

662
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,539
silent War period before the United

663
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:17,820
States was actually in as a combatant in

664
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,100
World War II Elizabeth's work proved

665
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,900
invaluable to fight against this kind of

666
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,700
enemy Espionage that was happening in

667
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,020
silent

668
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,940
however her accomplishments were Again

669
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,679
overshadowed by the Federal Bureau of

670
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,500
Investigation which took credit for most

671
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,299
if not all of her discoveries

672
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,400
so her work was focused on deciphering

673
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,960
encrypted messages of course sent by

674
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,900
Nazi spies from South America to Germany

675
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,780
and back and so they were operating both

676
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,120
in Argentina and other countries in

677
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,440
South America and then also some

678
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
operating within the U.S

679
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,299
she was responsible for breaking these

680
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,159
codes and uncovering vital intelligence

681
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,500
then led to the apprehension of these

682
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,820
enemy agents and the Coast Guard

683
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,179
Crypt analytic unit that she had founded

684
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:07,280
was actually who was both receiving and

685
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,080
decrypting these messages

686
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,659
the FBI though at the time was led by a

687
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,120
guy named J Edgar Hoover and he was very

688
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,620
eager to build his reputation and

689
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,840
strength as the nation's Premier law

690
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,280
enforcement agency

691
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,320
and so in doing so the FBI often would

692
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,700
take credit for the successes that

693
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,860
Freeman and her team were making the

694
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,799
decrypted messages were used by the FBI

695
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
to apprehend spies and dismantle the

696
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,020
networks but her role in these remained

697
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,480
undisclosed to the public

698
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,159
and for many years historians even

699
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,080
credited the FBI and their field work in

700
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,700
breaking up these spy rings and

701
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,679
decrypting these messages and helping to

702
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
win the silent war in South America this

703
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
was both because of Hoover's desire of

704
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,039
course to promote himself in the bureau

705
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,600
and because of the highly classified

706
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,820
nature of Elizabeth's work

707
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,140
but the FBI wasn't the one that

708
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,640
intercepted these messages they didn't

709
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,140
break the codes they didn't have a code

710
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,080
breaking Department the Coast Guard was

711
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,299
doing that and Elizabeth's team was

712
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:04,260
doing that

713
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,059
and once the documents behind those

714
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,159
accomplishments were they classified it

715
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
was really obvious who the vital source

716
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,940
of the information was because every one

717
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,799
of these documents even in the FBI Files

718
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,140
said CG decrypt at the bottom for Coast

719
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,880
Guard decrypt right that's something

720
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,080
they placed on the bottom of every

721
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,340
document when they sent it to another

722
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,380
agency the FBI or to the British or to

723
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,600
the dod and so these descript

724
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,059
decryptions uh you know they save lives

725
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,600
they stopped cues of fascist coups in

726
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,520
South America they

727
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
um drove wedges between Germany and its

728
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,919
would-be South American Allies

729
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,620
um but Freeman's most notable work

730
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,039
during World War II involved uh cracking

731
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,360
the Enigma machine

732
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,460
so this is an encryption device that was

733
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,080
used by the German military to encode

734
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,480
and decode messages it has complex

735
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,520
settings right which everyone thought

736
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,279
made it virtually impenetrable billions

737
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,340
of permutations and combinations

738
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,600
but alongside British count and parts

739
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,000
including Alan Turing and his team at

740
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,100
blatchery Park Freeman helped develop

741
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,779
and devise techniques to break the

742
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,760
Enigma code which ultimately played

743
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,559
obviously a critical role in the Allied

744
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,059
victory

745
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,179
uh and her efforts you know

746
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:18,480
allowed the US to and its allies to

747
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,340
intercept and understand enemy

748
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,799
Communications uh was invaluable in

749
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,900
making crucial decisions during the war

750
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,760
and like I said saving countless lives

751
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,820
so an example of that is that there are

752
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,460
over 8 000 soldiers being transported

753
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,159
upon uh in the on the Queen Mary

754
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,980
uh and Hitler himself had put a personal

755
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,440
bounty on the Queen Mary promising the

756
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,000
Iron Cross and a bounty of one million

757
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,039
reichmarks to any U-Boat captain that

758
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,620
was able to sink her

759
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,960
but then again following the war all of

760
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
that was classified so her contributions

761
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,100
to this were kept secret to protect her

762
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,480
identity and the sensitive nature of the

763
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,820
fact that we had broken the Enigma and

764
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,320
so it would only be many years after the

765
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,940
war that her accomplishments were

766
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,679
publicly recognized

767
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,900
right and this groundbreaking work

768
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,059
that Elizabeth did and William Freeman

769
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,419
did in the field of cryptanalyst uh was

770
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,740
foundational right it was the foundation

771
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,220
of the modern National Security Agency

772
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,799
um the pioneered efforts in code

773
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,539
breaking and its importance in peace

774
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,919
time and in war

775
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,440
and William is often regarded as the

776
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,960
father of modern American cryptology he

777
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,000
founded What's called the Army's signal

778
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,279
intelligence service which would uh

779
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,840
evolve into the NSA and was responsible

780
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,900
for intercepting and deciphering uh

781
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,520
foreign military Communications he

782
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
focused heavily on a number of

783
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,480
encryption machines from Japan during

784
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,039
the war

785
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,059
um

786
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,059
and so those combined efforts right of

787
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,740
the Freeman significantly influenced the

788
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,299
US government's understanding of the

789
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,100
Strategic value of cryptology

790
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,140
and as the war moved into the you know

791
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,880
after the war we moved into the Cold War

792
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,400
area that need for an agency to handle

793
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,159
this increasingly uh complex challenges

794
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,960
of cryptology and signals intelligence

795
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,179
became evident and President Harry

796
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,840
Truman established the NSA in 1952.

797
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,120
and the nsa's primary mission was of

798
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,100
course and is still in theory to protect

799
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,539
and defend the U.S national security

800
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,700
systems and produce foreign signals

801
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,620
intelligence

802
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,400
um and originally the NSA had named an

803
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,460
auditorium at Fort Meade uh after

804
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,480
William

805
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
however uh and this is this is actually

806
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,559
Elizabeth

807
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,559
um at that dedication with a bust of her

808
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,000
husband when they dedicated that

809
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,460
Auditorium but later on after

810
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,919
Elizabeth's death it became you know

811
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,100
public information that she contributed

812
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,279
so much to this effort as well and that

813
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,720
her work probably deserved equal

814
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,039
recognition

815
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,260
and so in response to that the NSA

816
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,700
actually took the decision to rename the

817
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,740
auditorium it now honors both William

818
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,059
and Elizabeth

819
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,640
and this change underscores the agencies

820
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,520
in our uh understanding and

821
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
acknowledgment of the significant

822
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,400
contributions made by both of the

823
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Freemans in the field of Crypt analysts

824
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,520
and so that that renaming you know

825
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,620
serves as a testament I think to both

826
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,440
Elizabeth and Williams uh Collective

827
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
Legacy in cryptology and also highlights

828
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,179
I think the importance of recognizing

829
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,940
often over overlooked work of female

830
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,520
code Breakers and cryptanalysts uh whose

831
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,440
efforts were instrumental in shaping the

832
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,120
course of history and the development of

833
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,399
modern intelligence practices

834
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,740
and furthermore the Freeman's work went

835
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,620
beyond their professional careers they

836
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,000
both dedicated themselves to the

837
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
education and mentorship of future Crypt

838
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,320
analysts and their commitments to

839
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,820
nurturing that talent and sharing

840
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,440
knowledge created this kind of robust

841
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
and skilled Workforce in cryptology

842
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
that's of course continued to evolve in

843
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,820
the ever-changing landscape of Global

844
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,559
Security threats

845
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,840
so that's the story of Elizabeth but

846
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,700
what can we kind of take away from all

847
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,740
this how does this kind of Tangled

848
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,419
history of you know the works of

849
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,700
Shakespeare leading to an incorrect

850
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,220
theory about who authored them uh to the

851
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,320
founding of one of the greatest code

852
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,240
breaking security organs Focus

853
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,679
organizations we heard about this

854
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,559
morning from Dr Greene how does that all

855
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,200
tie into what we're doing today and and

856
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,880
help us think about how do we secure our

857
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,080
future together

858
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,700
so I think I think the lessons are these

859
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,140
I think they're crucial for

860
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,360
understanding uh both the current and

861
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,760
future cyber security landscape and will

862
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,260
help us better protect ourselves and

863
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,779
organizations against threats and they

864
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,820
go back to the principles that I think

865
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,279
Elizabeth used uh in helping to find

866
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,919
found this uh this science

867
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,200
so first let's look at the concept of

868
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,179
interdisciplinary thinking and problem

869
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,340
solving so

870
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,380
you know in today's world we've just

871
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,659
heard from cat and I'm hurt we've heard

872
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,820
in lots of talks today about how

873
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,220
evolving cyber threats are and then they

874
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,620
can be increasing complexity leading to

875
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,360
you know the idea that we have to think

876
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,880
a lot differently right gone are the

877
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,260
days where there's you know one root

878
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,240
user or you could rely on a single

879
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,039
technology or a single method to secure

880
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,659
an organization

881
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,279
the most effective cyber security

882
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,679
strategies today incorporate a diverse

883
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,220
set of tools techniques drawing on the

884
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,260
experience of multiple Fields right

885
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,360
incorporating other disciplines like

886
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,340
psychology and sociology and economics

887
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,279
and into a cyber security strategy can

888
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,679
provide valuable insights into you know

889
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,179
what are the motivations behind

890
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,640
attackers and how does this impact their

891
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,580
behavior this allows you to anticipate

892
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,200
and mitigate threats you know more

893
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,340
effectively

894
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,080
so by fostering this culture of

895
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,000
interdisciplinary collaboration within

896
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,399
an organization I think you can find you

897
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,960
know a holistic approach to problem

898
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,179
solving that helps tackle you know

899
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,039
today's threats

900
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,840
the second key I think and this is

901
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,159
something that Elizabeth did her whole

902
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,200
career is you know thinking like your

903
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,600
adversary think like an attacker you

904
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,460
know in order to really defend against

905
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,260
threats effectively you have to

906
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,059
understand that mindset and the tactics

907
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,340
that your adversaries are using right

908
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,559
there we if we go back to uh her code

909
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,100
breaking uh in World War II uh or in the

910
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,260
silent War World War II uh there was

911
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,960
actually a famous novel that all of the

912
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,539
Nazi spies were using

913
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:18,600
um in order to be the like seed for

914
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,399
their encryption and so she started to

915
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,260
learn like what parts of that novel

916
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,940
people liked more and and what parts

917
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,220
they would be more likely to start from

918
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,440
so adopting that attacker's perspective

919
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,120
when evaluating your own security

920
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,399
posture is definitely one of the most

921
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,140
effective things that you can do to

922
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,460
evaluate the effectiveness of that

923
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,559
posture you have to ask questions like

924
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,480
how would I try to exploit this system

925
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,399
what would be the most valuable Target

926
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,679
if I was attacking it and that can

927
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
uncover potential vulnerabilities that

928
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,260
might not have been immediate

929
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,020
immediately apparent if you're just you

930
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,120
know starting from that posture

931
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
and then again I think you know we heard

932
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,720
about it before but conducting regular

933
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,880
threat assessments and penetration tests

934
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,100
that help you simulate simulate what a

935
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,200
real world attack looks like

936
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,940
um identifies areas where your defense

937
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,700
is lacking and that creates a proactive

938
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,320
approach to security and not an

939
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,700
assumption

940
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,140
of security

941
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,419
and the third takeaway is to not over

942
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,159
assume right to know that nothing is

943
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,260
impenetrable right the the Titanic was

944
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Unsinkable the Enigma was impenetrable

945
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,519
but no matter how robust your security

946
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,320
measures will be well we heard this

947
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,460
morning from Dr Green that you know

948
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,980
128-bit encryption or a thousand twenty

949
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,779
bit encryption was unbreakable and then

950
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,399
we found out it was broken

951
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,799
so no matter how robust your security

952
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,960
measures may be you know there's going

953
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,460
to always be an attention a potential

954
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,559
for an attacker to find a way in

955
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,179
and so it's crucial to constantly

956
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,820
evaluate where you're at and adopt that

957
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,200
mindset of continuous learning and

958
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,880
Improvement right we heard of training

959
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,620
and continuous learning from cat just

960
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,760
recently

961
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
and so by regularly challenging your own

962
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,720
security measures you're going to be

963
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,059
able to identify and address you know

964
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,519
where there are issues you know where

965
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:58,080
there have been internal or external

966
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,600
attempts to breach your security and

967
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,980
then things like bug Bounty programs

968
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,740
that can incentivize or security

969
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,480
researchers to do the same are going to

970
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,740
really help you take a look at your

971
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,480
system from the outside in

972
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,280
and so by embracing this idea that no

973
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,918
security uh plan is perfect you create

974
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,219
this culture of vigilance and resilience

975
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,780
and I think the most important thing

976
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,460
that we can take away

977
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,460
um from Elizabeth's life is to speak up

978
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,379
when something doesn't feel right right

979
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,580
speak up when you're seeing you know

980
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,040
compliance uh as security or you know

981
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,280
complacence with compliance right this

982
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,780
final takeaway is the need to address

983
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,359
this idea of being complacent with

984
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,159
compliance you know far too often

985
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,320
organizations are relying on their you

986
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,060
know compliance standards as the primary

987
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,300
security measure and of course you know

988
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,099
we're in an area where compliance with

989
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,960
regulations and standards is critical

990
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,060
for organizations but it shouldn't be

991
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,500
mistaken for a comprehensive security

992
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,760
strategy

993
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,140
you know that complacence with

994
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,599
compliance can lead to a false sense of

995
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,160
security leaving your organization

996
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,720
actually more vulnerable to cyber

997
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,400
threats that aren't addressed through

998
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,440
existing regulations and so it's

999
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,000
important to go beyond the minimum

1000
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,220
requirements and proactively Implement

1001
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,200
security measures and it's most

1002
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,880
important that when you notice that the

1003
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,339
focus is more on ticking the boxes of

1004
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,200
compliance rather than addressing real

1005
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,420
security concerns that you're not afraid

1006
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,040
to speak up right you're not afraid to

1007
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,900
say what might be sacrilegious you're

1008
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,880
not afraid to educate your colleagues on

1009
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
the importance of robust security

1010
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,060
measures and the potential consequences

1011
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,640
of not adopting them instead bearing

1012
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,140
your hands in the heads in the sand of

1013
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,460
compliance

1014
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,900
and that will help ensure your

1015
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,640
organization you know remains resilient

1016
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,099
against evolving security threats

1017
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,440
right that's the idea that started

1018
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,300
Elizabeth's career this this pattern

1019
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,680
recognition we can think about how

1020
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,140
important that human element still is to

1021
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,180
this day it's it's interesting to me how

1022
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,940
Full Circle we've come actually

1023
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,440
um you know originally Elizabeth was

1024
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,839
using pencil and paper to solve these

1025
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,599
complex puzzles and codes using her own

1026
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,480
unique ability to identify patterns

1027
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,900
and then of course you know today the

1028
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,980
opposite is somewhat true right

1029
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,599
cryptology is based in some of the most

1030
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,640
advanced math that we've just yet

1031
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,260
developed as a species

1032
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,940
yet what are we coming back to right

1033
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,380
we're circling back to this idea of

1034
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,940
artificial intelligence which in its

1035
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,619
current form you know machine learning

1036
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,359
large language models boils down to

1037
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,220
trying to reproduce that thing that

1038
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,500
humans are better at and best at right

1039
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,720
pattern recognition and so I think

1040
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,099
that'll change the way we work but I

1041
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,720
don't think humans and our ability to

1042
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,280
speak up and see problems with patterns

1043
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,859
is going to go away anytime soon

1044
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,500
so in these four ways by you know

1045
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,480
fostering interdisciplinary thinking and

1046
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,880
problem solving speaking up when it's

1047
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,760
complacents with compliance uh thinking

1048
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
like an attacker remembering that

1049
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,359
nothing's impenetrable you'll be able to

1050
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,220
significantly improve your

1051
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,960
organization's cyber security posture

1052
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,720
and when you do you take a minute to

1053
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,000
thank Elizabeth Smith Freeman her

1054
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
remarkable accomplishments in the field

1055
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,540
of cryptanalysts Crypt analysis have

1056
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,820
left an indelible mark on you know the

1057
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,619
history of cryptology and code breaking

1058
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,960
in general uh but her work was also

1059
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,660
invaluable in trailblazing you know in

1060
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,579
in starting a science and and was

1061
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,079
matched maybe only by her husband

1062
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,180
although he would say otherwise

1063
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,700
and her experience or her expertise and

1064
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,200
dedication paved the way for future

1065
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,060
generations of cryptanalysts but also

1066
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,460
demonstrated the importance of

1067
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,020
cryptology in protecting the most

1068
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,420
powerful thing knowledge

1069
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,000
and that is unsurprisingly what she had

1070
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,760
inscribed on William's Tombstone when he

1071
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,280
passed away in 1969. again we see the

1072
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,660
phrase at the bottom here that came to

1073
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,820
find both of their lives knowledge is

1074
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,839
power

1075
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,119
but this is Elizabeth Smith Freeman

1076
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,220
we're talking about the woman who would

1077
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,140
write her kids letters at camp in

1078
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,900
ciphertext who threw a dinner party once

1079
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,700
where the menu was encoded and one of

1080
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,680
the dishes was called a dish mixed

1081
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,680
together in an Inseparable way it was a

1082
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,940
hash and you know play on the word yeah

1083
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,800
uh so she couldn't let a simple thing

1084
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,900
like a tombstone not have a secret code

1085
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,160
embedded right

1086
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,960
so the letters that spell out knowledge

1087
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,760
is power she actually

1088
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,339
um specified which would have serifs and

1089
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,619
not to make a bi-formed alphabet right

1090
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,740
making it a famous a b bakonian Cipher

1091
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,380
uh and at Betty Williams initials uh

1092
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,839
again in the tombstone at the bottom

1093
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,200
so while cryptologists like all mere

1094
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,599
mortals will die one day their impact on

1095
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,359
society and indeed their hidden messages

1096
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,180
can go on much longer

1097
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,220
so as we wrap up I encourage each of you

1098
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,500
to reflect on these key takeaways you

1099
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,420
know think about cyber security as an

1100
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,820
ongoing journey and see how you can

1101
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,859
adopt those principles right they're

1102
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,900
they're critical for understanding both

1103
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,000
current and future State uh and how you

1104
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,040
can protect your organization

1105
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,440
so thank you so much for your time today

1106
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,839
and for those who came expecting bacon

1107
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,480
that's all I got for you

1108
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,460
um but hopefully even if you didn't get

1109
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,560
the bacon you were looking for you were

1110
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,700
able to start thinking about what it

1111
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,400
means to be a modern security engineer

1112
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,720
and in the end that should be able to

1113
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,720
bring home some bacon for you okay sorry

1114
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,160
no I had to do that one

1115
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,619
thank you

1116
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,320
thanks and if you want to uh find out

1117
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,420
more about this presentation or even

1118
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,160
better read the book that inspired this

1119
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,720
talk call the women that smashed codes

1120
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,300
you can find a link to that at nux.gg

1121
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,720
bacon uh and then you can also join the

1122
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,339
project Discovery Discord if you want to

1123
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,500
chat more I'm on there all the time and

1124
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,000
find me on the internet at O'Leary crew

1125
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
most places thanks again

1126
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,449
[Applause]
