o'clock in the morning last night I feel

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
like I have more energy than all of you

being Sean's boss it's exactly he's

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,140
lying I don't even know how I have

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,579
energy this morning to be honest taking

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,920
care of him but uh no and in all honesty

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,899
Sean is amazing to work with uh we work

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,879
together uh at uh at Yahoo we're with

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,339
the paranoids uh before that I did about

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
10 years with the FBI doing some

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,220
counterintelligence type work it was

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,080
super secret and super fun

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
um but uh yeah I had a good time but

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
here uh to talk to you all today and uh

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,479
go over the Action Group method Sean

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,460
yeah he also left out so he is the

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,600
director of threat detection and

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,119
response at Yahoo uh I am the director

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,680
of forensics and incident response

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,240
engineering lovingly called fire

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,460
internally

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,000
um before that IR consultant sock work a

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
whole bunch of stuff so we have spent

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,659
the last couple years working on what we

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,100
call the Action Group model the incident

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,900
response we think it's kind of a cool

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,820
thing so we figured hey we're going to

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,900
come talk to a bunch of people about it

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,159
because it'll be fun yeah it seems to

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,140
work okay for us so hopefully you know

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,340
this might be interesting for you all

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,200
maybe maybe not we'll see take what you

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,240
can home with you yep all right you

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,619
wanna you wanna Dive Right In yeah let's

48
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,780
do it John

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,220
cool all right so we're going to start

50
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,500
you off so this is our general workflow

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,659
for the action group model so

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,220
essentially this is not terribly

53
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,320
different from most other models of

54
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,759
instant response you have sort of an

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,560
intake section hey how are we actually

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,220
bringing things into uh our our area

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,660
um are we finding detections do we have

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,919
things that are being sent in by our

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,720
partners we have to do something with

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,180
that after we have it though this goes

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,739
into our triage section where we're

62
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,680
really asking the basic facts of what's

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,980
going on now our folks that are in our

64
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,200
fire area essentially doing these first

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
two areas they're receiving things in

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,739
they're then asking the basic facts and

67
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,840
trying to determine do we have a problem

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
here fundamentally that's really what

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,260
we're wondering and really what we're

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,180
looking for is is there some sort of

71
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,980
malicious activity

72
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,319
um that could be going on and do we have

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,940
something that's a big problem that's

74
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,200
what we mean by imminent material

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
compromise that we have up there on the

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,980
board right now but if we do have those

77
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,379
two things we go into activating our

78
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,060
Action Group if we don't have those

79
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,459
things this is our normal BAU stuff hey

80
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:54,840
you looking hey we've got maybe a fish

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,099
email or something like that we need to

82
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,120
deal with doesn't look like there's

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,860
anything going on whatever we can handle

84
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,480
that normally but when we do have

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,099
something that looks like it could be a

86
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,959
big problem we move into the action

87
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,019
group and this is really the gist of

88
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,819
what we want to talk to you all today

89
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,980
this is where we bring in a number of

90
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,360
different folks a number of different

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,159
partners from all across cyber security

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,340
Human Resources legal ethics and

93
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,920
compliance physical security to work on

94
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,900
these big major incidents when we do run

95
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,340
into them and this is really important

96
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,319
we'll get into the details of these in a

97
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,659
few slides but as we go through this we

98
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,280
kind of continue on through the general

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
method we do our response this is where

100
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,060
we're asking what are the key questions

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
that we need to deal with here uh and

102
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,500
then we then go through set forward

103
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,659
those work streams that we have

104
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,640
afterwards we go into our closeout this

105
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
is our normal Lessons Learned

106
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,459
post-incident response activities and

107
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,319
things like that but as we go forward

108
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,299
and as as Sean starts to walk you

109
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,500
through all these I want you to be

110
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,000
really careful and be thinking about

111
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,640
sort of this Action Group model bringing

112
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,379
a number of folks together having these

113
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,360
pre-established connections to be able

114
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,400
to come in and provide oversight and

115
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,500
assign things to a dedicated Incident

116
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,780
Commander that can be really any of the

117
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,760
individuals that you're working with so

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,860
anybody that's working in a sock in our

119
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,599
area anybody that's working on our fire

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,159
team can step up and be an Incident

121
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,620
Commander with that guidance of that

122
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,000
action group that we have across the

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
organization

124
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,418
you get over you Sean yeah go ahead jump

125
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,100
to the next one so we'll go through each

126
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,478
one a little bit and something to bear

127
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,000
in mind your mileage will vary we

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
actually tried to extrapolate our plan

129
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,580
out into a much more simplistic concept

130
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,139
that can be applicable to your

131
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,820
organization so some of our language is

132
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,740
removed and we kind of open this up a

133
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,020
little bit so like intake intake is just

134
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,820
how you find stuff how does stuff come

135
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,340
in do people tell you about bad stuff do

136
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,500
you have detections do you have threat

137
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,060
hunts do you have a threat intelligence

138
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,580
team it's ultimately about all of the

139
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,919
different processes and feeds that feed

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,340
into you finding bad stuff or I should

141
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,560
say at this point investigatable things

142
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,479
it's really important to know your

143
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,919
intakes because those are going to tell

144
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,960
you what work you have to do those are

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
going to tell you what gaps you might

146
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,139
have as you look at your intake so on

147
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,699
and so forth we're not going to spend a

148
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,960
whole lot of time here we'll go right to

149
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,280
the next one

150
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
so triage we simplified this one a

151
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,020
little bit too basically this is your

152
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,479
general sock which I kind of hate the

153
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,720
term sock these days IR whatever case

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,340
you want to make your investigative

155
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,440
teams are going to do this and they're

156
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,699
going to start here

157
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,100
so first thing they have to do is kind

158
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,199
of ask themselves a very simple question

159
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,960
right is this bad

160
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,759
that's really the first question if it's

161
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,639
not well you're done hey move on to the

162
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,160
next thing or you know tune it out

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,180
there's a whole bunch of other things

164
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,639
you can do if it's not bad but for the

165
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,100
sake of the IR process if it's not

166
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,039
you're good if it is then the next

167
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
question you have to ask yourself and

168
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,100
this is really important is does this

169
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,320
meet the definition of an incident at my

170
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,220
company

171
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,960
your mileage may vary on what an

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,580
incident is some places every

173
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,080
vulnerability that's critical is an

174
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
incident some places it's not so your

175
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,860
mileage could completely vary but you

176
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
have to ask what is the definition of an

177
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,000
incident and this yeah it was just going

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
to add in there Sean too this is

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,940
something you need to be asking yourself

180
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,979
before you actually get into something

181
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,840
that might be an instant uh we talk

182
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
about this a lot all the time is this is

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,660
something that you don't want to be

184
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,220
discussing right when you see something

185
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,840
bad yes so it's going to be really

186
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,240
important to jump in there talk with

187
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
your folks talk with your leadership

188
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,419
talk with your partners that you have

189
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,740
and make sure that you understand

190
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,780
exactly what that means for your

191
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,580
organization there are lots of

192
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,380
definitions of incident out there but as

193
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,600
Sean was saying this will highly depend

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,120
on what your business is doing what is

195
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,740
valuable what your crown jewels are what

196
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,020
your critical assets are it's really

197
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,160
important to make sure you define that

198
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,100
early so quick note on IR burnout a lot

199
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,720
of ir teams burn out because they don't

200
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,520
have a clearly defined definition of an

201
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,139
incident so everything gets lumped on

202
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,280
their shoulders and becomes an incident

203
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,620
that's not where you want to be you need

204
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,600
to Define that very early so you can say

205
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,039
hey this is when we have an incident

206
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,780
process because incident processes are

207
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,520
time consuming and involve lawyers which

208
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,259
is exhausting looking at you

209
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,900
our lawyer is here so I got to make some

210
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,318
jokes

211
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,180
um so if it's not then what we do is we

212
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,680
move it into a process where an analyst

213
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,419
can handle it so to use Taylor's early

214
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,120
example of a phishing email if it's one

215
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,039
email low impact nothing bad happened

216
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,840
right an analyst can handle that without

217
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,340
a whole bunch of people we don't need to

218
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,860
spin up and call in the the strike force

219
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,560
or whatever words people use these days

220
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,840
all we need to do is just go mitigate

221
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,759
that one little issue it's what we call

222
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,699
an event rather than an incident now if

223
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,620
it's an incident that's where we come

224
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,419
into the Action Group concept and that's

225
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,160
really important so as you'll see as we

226
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,660
work through the workflow you initiate

227
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,160
the action group meeting you set up a

228
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,199
comms Channel and you assign an incident

229
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,160
commander and we're going to take some

230
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,380
time and dig through those components

231
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,780
so go ahead Mr Johnson cool so let's

232
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,099
talk a little bit about the action group

233
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:54,780
so we talk about this action we've set

234
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,340
it up Bunch but like what what actually

235
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,380
is this and and really what we're what

236
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,400
we're looking at here and what we're

237
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,720
talking about when we mean Action Group

238
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,340
is getting stakeholders in the right

239
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,780
place to be able to make operational

240
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,819
decisions uh and to be able to provide

241
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,160
the right guidance to the folks that are

242
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,259
actually working the incident

243
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,060
um so this is really really important to

244
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,979
establish this up front and determine

245
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,539
who actually needs to be in the room and

246
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,340
this shouldn't be folks that are up in

247
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,599
the c-suite these should not be

248
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,479
Executives who are going to say okay

249
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,639
cyber security stuff bad guy doing

250
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,860
something all right uh call the police

251
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,020
like not not that right we need folks

252
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,639
who are actually at the decision-making

253
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,800
level they can make tangible decisions

254
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,500
on what's going on but also are close

255
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,820
enough to the operational level to

256
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,440
understand the ins and outs and the

257
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
different work streams that you're going

258
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,839
to have when you're working one of these

259
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,640
incidents and so typically this action

260
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,919
group is going to be making decisions on

261
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,480
where you're going but really

262
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,700
establishing work streams

263
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,260
um making sure that these work streams

264
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,420
are are answering the core investigative

265
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,640
goals that you actually have and so you

266
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,260
know when we talk about who's actually a

267
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,120
member of this action group like clearly

268
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
you need the folks that are doing

269
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
incident response so

270
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,920
um for ourselves you know Sean myself on

271
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,700
this

272
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,899
um but also you want to have other

273
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,580
elements of cyber security that are

274
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,620
important to have in there as well such

275
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,839
as your intelligence teams that you have

276
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,120
uh potentially even a red team point of

277
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,339
contact maybe some of your policy folks

278
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,580
this can vary slightly depending on what

279
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,660
you need to deal with in your

280
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,220
organization but having the right folks

281
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,420
in that room that you can really get

282
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,580
answers to most any questions or at

283
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,560
least know the right direction to go to

284
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,540
it's really important so one thing

285
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,680
that's actually really important about

286
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
how you structure an action group if

287
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,980
you're going to do it it's split up into

288
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,260
what we call responsible parties and

289
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,959
support parties and that that is kind of

290
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,160
the key because a lot of people when

291
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
they think about an incident they think

292
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,220
about just the responsible parties right

293
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,680
the IR team is a responsible party up to

294
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,500
your CSO is arguably a responsible party

295
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
but they don't think about support

296
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,560
parties your detection engineering team

297
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,060
great support party your threat

298
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,860
intelligent function great support legal

299
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,660
sometimes great

300
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,700
[Laughter]

301
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,220
so it you really want to look at like

302
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,040
who can help with this in some way shape

303
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,140
or form because as anybody who's worked

304
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,580
an incident knows they're all complex

305
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,920
they're all different especially like

306
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,279
big ones so bringing together a

307
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,839
multitude of experience thought

308
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,000
processes and skill sets is going to get

309
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,860
you through that better and I'll dive

310
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,420
into that on like the importance of like

311
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,040
variable work streams later but good

312
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,019
yeah absolutely and I think if you think

313
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,700
about this we take a practical example

314
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,899
say you've got a corporate account

315
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,519
that's been taken over by an adversary

316
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,620
or something like that as you dive into

317
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,060
that yes you're going to need to deal

318
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,040
with sort of the Tactical of okay how do

319
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,779
we evict this actor how do we actually

320
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,060
figure out where this actor is but

321
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,380
oftentimes you're also going to be

322
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,120
wondering okay what data has been

323
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
compromised could things be out the door

324
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,019
do we have any regulatory obligations

325
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,180
and having those right folks in the room

326
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,160
that really understand how the process

327
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,320
works to be able to give you that

328
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,180
counsel really in the moment is

329
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,800
incredibly important because one of the

330
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
things you really don't want to be doing

331
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,700
is when you're dealing with an incident

332
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,920
who do we talk to who do we actually go

333
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,200
to to get an answer to this question are

334
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
we under some regulatory obligation how

335
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,220
do we actually get this data all of

336
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,019
these questions may come up during an

337
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,640
incident and I think it's really

338
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
important to be able to have these

339
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,660
relationships pre-established and make

340
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,339
sure that they're all in that room now

341
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,260
one of the things that you all may be

342
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,820
asking and are probably wondering here

343
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,740
is hey we've got a bunch of cooks in the

344
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,420
kitchen now so we may have those

345
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,860
responsible parties or maybe these

346
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,240
support parties that we have in our

347
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,740
Action Group too

348
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,540
but how do we actually make decisions

349
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,459
how do we make sure that operational

350
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,500
control is maintained and and for that

351
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,940
I'll kick you over to Sean in The

352
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,160
Incident Commander concept cool

353
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,079
so this this probably isn't a super New

354
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,579
Concept everybody but this is something

355
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,019
that's super important to talk about

356
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,240
across your organization to make sure

357
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,640
that it exists right

358
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,380
the first thing that the action group

359
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,120
does before we do anything else is we

360
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,500
establish this role of The Incident

361
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
Commander one of the great things about

362
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,459
the Action Group model for us is it

363
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,779
makes The Incident Commander a very

364
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,779
accessible role so it's not just who's

365
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,459
the most experienced guy or who is this

366
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,200
because they have a team of people that

367
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
are there to support so we can make it a

368
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,920
junior and we often will on different

369
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,980
cases and can it makes it a very

370
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,899
accessible model because they have

371
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,220
support it's kind of like being thrown

372
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,660
in the ocean but having somebody next to

373
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,040
you with a life vest

374
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,019
that's really kind of my whole model of

375
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,360
leadership so

376
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,500
it seems to work all right I don't know

377
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,060
what is the front row say over here yes

378
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,079
good no okay we got one no it's okay I

379
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,519
can do that

380
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,160
um so the other thing that you really

381
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,540
gain from The Incident Commander model

382
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,040
though is you have somebody who has

383
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,079
operational control that's really

384
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
important and that has to be agreed upon

385
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,480
at a business level so when that person

386
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,240
regardless of their rank or title hits

387
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,579
up a VP somewhere and says I need you to

388
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,860
do this they understand that they need

389
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,240
to do that

390
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,339
that is like the most critical thing

391
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,019
during an incident it's also the person

392
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,820
who frankly keeps track of things and

393
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,440
helps us sign out the work streams that

394
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,240
we'll talk about in a minute and all

395
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,220
those other things because somebody's

396
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,200
got to keep track keep everybody on task

397
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
and make sure that we have the power to

398
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,560
handle the thing that we need to handle

399
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,760
in that moment

400
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,100
yeah and I I you know it sounds scary in

401
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
the moment particularly for junior

402
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,860
employees who are going to be an

403
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,779
Incident Commander oh my gosh we've got

404
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,279
an adversary that's doing something we

405
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,660
got to deal with them and I'm the

406
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,579
commander looking at you mark over there

407
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,220
uh but uh but I think fundamentally

408
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,779
that's why the action group is really

409
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,339
important because you do have the

410
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,779
leaders in the room who are tasking out

411
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,160
those work streams and understanding

412
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
what we need to do and really empowering

413
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,660
that Incident Commander to get done what

414
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,459
we have to get done for the incident

415
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,600
itself

416
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,980
um also really important to bring in say

417
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,779
legal counsel with that Action Group to

418
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,459
say like hey this is what we can do this

419
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:40,139
is what we can't do those sorts of

420
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,760
things as well just wanted to shout out

421
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
bunny Smith Who's down there supporting

422
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,060
us and gave us these these lovely shirts

423
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,339
today give us these lovely shirts

424
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,040
all right so this all kind of bleeds

425
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,540
into the what happens when we actually

426
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,320
do response though right so the way we

427
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,639
do response and the way that we think

428
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,440
about response is this very secular

429
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,200
thing it's also meant to be particularly

430
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,420
adaptable this isn't some Playbook that

431
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,339
says always go do this always go do that

432
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,440
always go do this other thing I

433
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,700
mentioned earlier incidents are

434
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,079
different different things happen

435
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,060
different things are affected there's

436
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,440
different ways that you need to approach

437
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
it so we put a whole bunch of smart

438
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,519
people in a room as the tldr and we know

439
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,800
Ann Taylor and John yeah plus Taylor and

440
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,959
John true and then we go what do we need

441
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,040
to do

442
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
okay like we need to know this we need

443
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,279
to know this we need to know this we

444
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,260
need to know this we should investigate

445
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,720
here mitigate here do this this and this

446
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,480
we build that out and then we assign

447
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,760
people to it and we assign across the

448
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,620
entire scope of the action group so

449
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,959
we'll go to if our threat intelligence

450
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,399
of threat intelligence members on the

451
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,720
Action Group who from your team is

452
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
assigned to this thing who are you

453
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,500
giving us we need somebody you have a

454
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,120
work stream you're going to do that

455
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,240
we'll build out this list and then we

456
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,399
assign it and we get very secular so the

457
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,980
investigation portion happens

458
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,779
it's a little bit kind of out in the

459
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,639
wind but the investigation is going to

460
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,839
be different could be different logs

461
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,459
could be different servers could be we

462
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:03,899
need forensics versus we just need

463
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,760
Network Telemetry it doesn't matter

464
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,220
we do that and then we come back

465
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,720
together as an action group and say hey

466
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,120
what have we learned what do we know now

467
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
well with what we know now

468
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,560
we can move back and establish some more

469
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,820
work streams because new information

470
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,760
means new actions that we can take

471
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,100
yeah absolutely and I think you know as

472
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,720
we think about hey different types of

473
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,339
attacks that you may see okay you've got

474
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,079
ransomware you've got you know an

475
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,540
account takeover or something like that

476
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,320
um

477
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,720
you may have Sops for those things and

478
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,639
that's fantastic but you're always going

479
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,380
to be finding new information during

480
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
your investigations that you're going to

481
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,579
need to be able to Pivot through so okay

482
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:42,839
you might have something that means

483
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,100
you've got a completely different type

484
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,540
of attack and you won't necessarily have

485
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,760
an sop to be able to account for every

486
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,139
single type of attack that you're going

487
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,000
to see so that's why it's important to

488
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,680
sort of remain flexible keep bringing

489
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,120
that new information back into the

490
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,220
working group we have the action group

491
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,500
and then making those decisions that

492
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,000
come out of the new information that you

493
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,760
have also for anybody here who who all

494
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,940
here Works in IR

495
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,380
is someone blowing up a helicopter with

496
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,180
an arrow not the perfect explanation of

497
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,560
what we do

498
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
High tip to Taylor here for finding the

499
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
gift last night but it is the perfect

500
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,500
explanation of this job

501
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,880
um all right let's let's keep going so

502
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,279
this is the whole model all laid out we

503
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,480
can leave it here for a second if

504
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,040
anybody wants to take a snapshot or do

505
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,300
any of that kind of stuff like you are

506
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,800
more than welcome to

507
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,660
you might be thinking that we haven't

508
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,699
yet covered post-incident activities and

509
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,139
we're going to do that with a completely

510
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,060
different model in a minute and we

511
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,019
actually have time to do that give

512
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,100
everybody a minute to take a picture

513
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,680
first and then we'll uh we'll jump into

514
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,019
the second model that we have that is

515
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,759
going to be a very brief overview

516
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,839
because we have a little bit of time

517
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,459
that that might be what we come talk to

518
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,380
everybody about next time yeah sounds

519
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,480
good go ahead

520
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,180
cool let's go into it okay so this whole

521
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,680
everything we've talked about today is

522
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,300
really part of what we call the threat

523
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,160
detection and response cycle so this

524
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,980
cycle is really intended to explain

525
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,800
everything that we need to do on our

526
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,380
side to be able to to detect and respond

527
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,760
to different threats that are out there

528
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,619
so this is something that Sean and I

529
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,880
have been have been working through and

530
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,619
really trying to understand okay so if

531
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,119
we take something if we take a critical

532
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,740
asset in the organization something like

533
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,319
that we need to be able to do all of

534
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,880
these different things we need to go

535
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,939
through each stage essentially and be

536
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,439
able to cover all of these things and do

537
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,599
it well so for example the first stage

538
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,099
that we have investigative tool

539
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,020
management this basically means we need

540
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,419
some sort of tools to be able to use in

541
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,980
our investigation this could be a Sim

542
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,419
this could be Splunk whatever something

543
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,580
like that this could be a number of

544
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,200
different things that we absolutely need

545
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,460
to have to be able to run our

546
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,380
investigation we then need to develop

547
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,760
use cases and this is a little bit

548
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,260
different from detections but what we're

549
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,820
essentially looking at here is hey can

550
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,799
we establish high-level use cases of

551
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,840
what we actually care about for

552
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,760
something that's going on for example do

553
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,380
we actually care about data being lost

554
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,260
something being sabotaged do we care

555
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,760
about something going to a competitor

556
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,200
these types of things we need to

557
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,820
understand and how that could actually

558
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,200
happen is something that we need to

559
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,940
establish and talk about

560
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,500
uh sort of that next stage data

561
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,820
architecture hey we need to have the

562
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,320
logs and we need to have the data to be

563
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,299
able to discover whatever use case that

564
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,100
is so if we care about data going out

565
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,380
the door how do we actually see that do

566
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,880
we need some coverage on our endpoints

567
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,100
do we need application logs what is it

568
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,559
that we actually need to be able to see

569
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,480
that next stage pretty self-explanatory

570
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,740
I think everybody gets this building

571
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,419
detections to actually describe those

572
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,460
use cases and making sure we have those

573
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,980
sort of next stage goes into alerting we

574
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,539
kind of separate these a little bit out

575
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,460
so yes we need to build those detections

576
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,260
but we also need to present that in a

577
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,940
way that really makes sense for our

578
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,880
analysts does it actually Elevate to

579
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,380
somebody's eyes that you're looking at a

580
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,020
painted glass now that being said this

581
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,820
industry changes all the time attacks

582
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,919
change all the time you cannot account

583
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,780
for a detection for every single bad

584
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,880
thing that happens hence we also include

585
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,799
threat hunting in here as a component

586
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,900
this is a relatively important part of a

587
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,360
program to be able to respond more

588
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,980
quickly than the detection Engineering

589
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,919
Process might take to look for stuff now

590
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,780
all of this feeds into all of it right

591
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,580
threat hunting feeds into detection as

592
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,320
we get in as we can continue moving

593
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,580
forward we talk about the incident

594
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,220
response and event investigation that

595
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,900
all feeds into detection that feeds into

596
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,340
data architecture that feeds into

597
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,320
everything but that's basically what we

598
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,840
were just walked through that so this

599
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,760
The Upfront of this whole talk was

600
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,580
basically the workflow for stage four

601
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,140
now what's really important and this is

602
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,280
where we get to the post-incident

603
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,960
activity component

604
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,700
mitigation Automation and control

605
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,440
recommendations is one of the most

606
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
important things that gets overlooked by

607
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,880
IR people and like investigative people

608
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,000
a lot we see things that happen we see

609
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,820
risks that other people might not see we

610
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,320
then need to take those risks

611
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,120
communicate them in a meaningful way to

612
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,860
the business to bring proactive change

613
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,799
or close those gaps we don't do that we

614
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,360
continue to see the same risks over and

615
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,860
over and over again you want to add on

616
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,380
to that yeah absolutely and this is

617
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,000
something that you know Sean was saying

618
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,059
hey we can't just live in a silo an

619
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:01,980
incident response we really have to be

620
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,480
able to work with the rest of our

621
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,460
partners that are out there be they in

622
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,679
different cyber security areas um be it

623
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,720
in Human Resources uh maybe we have

624
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,700
issues with something that isn't even

625
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,320
technically related like background

626
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,820
investigations or something like that if

627
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,200
we're dealing with Insider threat type

628
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
things so anyway just wanted to call

629
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,620
that out that this is another place

630
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,820
where you can really leverage that

631
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,200
action group that you use for

632
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,720
operational things now for those sort of

633
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,360
mitigation uh mitigation actions and and

634
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,280
automation that we want to do you can

635
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,320
then they understand the incidents that

636
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,700
you're seeing and can really help you

637
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,960
throughout the rest of the organization

638
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,539
make those changes those Upstream

639
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,160
changes that you need to ensure that

640
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,559
you're not seeing uh too much stuff

641
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,539
coming down the pipe on the IR area

642
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,640
so that's basically the talk and I have

643
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,140
to say you must be lucky or something

644
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,400
because this is the first time in my

645
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,660
life I've given a talk that's like bang

646
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,480
on time like just dead on the amount of

647
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,039
time it was all the planning we did for

648
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
this right right yeah the one hour last

649
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,340
night

650
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,200
um so that being said it's also worth

651
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,520
saying we don't have like an end slide

652
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,380
we totally have time for questions I

653
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,140
think right yeah questions okay cool

654
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,760
um none of this would have been possible

655
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,740
without the conversations that we've had

656
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,780
hell some I've had with many of you all

657
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,700
who are probably in this audience the

658
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,020
people that we work with every day

659
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,059
except Mark

660
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,200
um

661
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,460
but none of this would have been

662
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,780
possible without them so we have a lot

663
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,980
of people to thank and we're not going

664
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,900
to name them all but like it's just very

665
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,640
important to say that like this is not

666
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,220
just us like this is a lot of experience

667
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,679
and ideas that kind of built into this

668
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,419
yeah absolutely huge thank you to all

669
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,679
those folks and this has been you know

670
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,419
over the course of of several years

671
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,980
we've been thinking through this and and

672
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,059
putting some of these things into

673
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,799
practice and and we've found them really

674
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,659
helpful so if there's any elements of

675
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:40,740
this you know that you all want to take

676
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,020
back to your organizations please do at

677
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,520
the very least hope it starts some good

678
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,900
conversations about how we can build

679
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,940
some Partnerships internally and as well

680
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,799
get more folks becoming incident

681
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,299
commanders and actually working through

682
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:52,320
these things

683
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,860
good finish so for questions if possible

684
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,360
or if you can I would love if people

685
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,340
would come up and like I will like come

686
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,299
down here

687
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,740
that way they can say something and

688
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,000
they're like if not you can raise your

689
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,020
hand if you're not comfortable doing

690
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,580
that you just have to repeat the

691
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,960
question got it

692
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,919
hi question for everyone for you is that

693
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,340
um for I get this for a 24 7 sock but

694
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,140
for an action team what happens if this

695
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,720
happens on Saturday or Sunday

696
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,760
we call the action team yeah we call the

697
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,440
action team uh so I think that's that's

698
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
something that's really important and

699
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm really glad you brought that up

700
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,820
actually because you know this Action

701
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,919
Group particularly that core the

702
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,480
responsible parties in the Action Group

703
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,820
do need to be available so we will call

704
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,559
people in the middle of the night uh we

705
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,820
will call legal in the middle of the

706
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,620
night if we need to and we'll wake Folks

707
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,620
up we actually prefer it yeah yeah we'll

708
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,840
actually save incidents for early

709
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,659
Saturday morning maybe 3 A.M or so and

710
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,620
then

711
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,240
but no that that's actually a really

712
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
important part of it right you need to

713
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,080
be able especially if you don't have a

714
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,900
24 7 soccer or IR team um to be able to

715
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,400
have that Action Group really at the

716
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,480
beck and call

717
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,740
um of the folks that are working this

718
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,080
that is incredibly important um and you

719
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,400
have to have that buy-in ahead of time

720
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
as well so it's not always easy

721
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,059
convincing folks to be part of this

722
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,380
action group but usually you have some

723
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,419
cool examples you can use uh and we you

724
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,100
can sucker people like Bunny and doings

725
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,900
well let's be honest it extends past the

726
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,340
Action Group to be completely honest

727
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,520
right like how many IR teams have full

728
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,500
mitigation control across every possible

729
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,820
bad thing that could happen on their

730
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,500
Network or do you maybe sometimes need

731
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,940
to call somebody that doesn't like to

732
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,039
pick up on the weekends like that's just

733
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,080
part of the job calling people who don't

734
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,900
like to pick up on the weekends like

735
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,580
they'll deal that's why it's so

736
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,900
important to have this kind of stuff

737
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,360
agreed upon across like the higher up

738
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,520
leadership of your company because then

739
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,020
they can be mad about it but they know

740
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,220
it might come

741
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,140
what else anywhere please

742
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,780
how do you handle The Incident Commander

743
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,400
role going around the globe or around

744
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,720
the same lines I can take that one if

745
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,100
you want so we genuinely try to like

746
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,600
Incident Commander is somebody who is

747
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,340
there and available and like can do it

748
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,559
we can also hand off that role it's one

749
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,000
of the great things about doing this

750
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,500
kind of work it's not hard to hand off

751
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,360
that role and say hey you're in charge

752
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,559
now

753
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,080
or you have a team like mine I'm looking

754
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,700
at all of them with disappointment who

755
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,799
just don't leave when things happen and

756
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,720
just refuse

757
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,940
and that's on them not on us

758
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,220
yeah so this actually uh speaks to the

759
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,500
importance of making sure that everyone

760
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,840
uh in your soccer IR area is really

761
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
trained to do this and gets the

762
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,500
experience so if folks haven't done this

763
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,240
before hey get them to tag along in

764
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,980
Shadow something like that you got to

765
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,600
make sure that everybody really can step

766
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,100
up into that instant Commander role

767
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,020
because hey uh you know you may need to

768
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,059
be able to transfer something uh over

769
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,500
across you know the weekend something

770
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
like that

771
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,260
um you know or you may have folks pulled

772
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,580
off onto multiple incidents or something

773
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,440
which which does happen in the IR world

774
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,580
the other thing that's worth mentioning

775
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,900
is it's really the first couple hours

776
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,940
that are critical anyway because that's

777
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,320
when you take your first pass on work

778
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,640
streams you figure out what you want to

779
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,320
do and then people go off and start

780
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,380
working right so until there's new and

781
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,480
damning information if there is new and

782
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,100
damning information that's when the

783
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,840
Action Group gets back together and

784
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,039
that's when you can figure out the best

785
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
course of what to do next so it's very

786
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,360
much like meet plan work meet plan work

787
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,880
round and round in a circle all right

788
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,179
what else

789
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,580
go answer whoever

790
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,820
all right oh Elite come over

791
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,500
so it sounds like you guys have put this

792
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,659
in effect in the last what year or so

793
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,400
something like that a couple years

794
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,860
so what's the trade-off between you know

795
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,299
the red tape that comes with bureaucracy

796
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,620
when you add in all these different

797
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,200
teams and their way they're uh let's

798
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,779
just say ability to rapidly respond to

799
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,299
something is different than what IR or

800
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,100
security teams usually do so what's been

801
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,220
your trade-off or how you work through

802
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,559
that uh challenge

803
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,539
yeah so there's a really important

804
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,360
component to the Action Group

805
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,640
hey deal with it there's a really

806
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,960
important component to the action group

807
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,340
that we talked about earlier right

808
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,200
that's the responsible parties and

809
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,460
support parties

810
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,640
now I'll let you talk yeah absolutely so

811
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
um I guess I guess I'll talk a little

812
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,179
bit over Sean here um but yeah I think

813
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,980
fundamentally this is why you need to

814
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,480
pre-establish the action group and make

815
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,520
sure that you have uh not just a

816
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,140
commitment of the responsible parties to

817
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,179
actually show up um but to actually get

818
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,580
the job done and ass and and really make

819
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,460
sure they are pushing off uh the current

820
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,900
work that they have so we have a lot of

821
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,580
times where we have legal counsel or

822
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,380
someone else who is dealing with other

823
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,480
things that are going on but when we do

824
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,220
activate that that Action Group there's

825
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,720
an understanding on all those parties

826
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,580
that that is the priority to do right

827
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,440
now so getting that buy-in ahead of time

828
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,480
is incredibly important to do and that's

829
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,039
really how we've sort of fought that red

830
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,460
tape now it's not always perfect but

831
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,840
generally for those responsible parties

832
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,039
that you have

833
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
um making sure that they understand that

834
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,179
well Bunny wants to jump in this is

835
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:58,380
going to be good

836
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,419
so uh one of the pieces I want to add to

837
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,419
this is appropriate air cover one of the

838
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,880
red tape Killers is having somebody

839
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,000
that's got the facility to talk to the

840
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,320
rest of them and make them stand down

841
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,179
and that's where you make friends with

842
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,360
your HR your legal counsel somebody that

843
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
can give you that air cover and that's

844
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,320
the other piece of the puzzle because

845
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,299
without that without having the

846
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,980
effective Partners you are going to get

847
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,000
bogged down in the red tape

848
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,580
quick question where can we find more

849
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,400
documentation about the methodology so

850
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,980
we had this brilliant plan that we were

851
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,480
going to work all this up and we were

852
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,679
going to launch a blog post alongside

853
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,620
the talk and we're going to do all that

854
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,179
and then we wrote the talk last night

855
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,340
and have none of that

856
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,100
um that being said we are planning on

857
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,140
doing all of that when this recording

858
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,400
goes live

859
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,380
so like we should have companion stuff

860
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,059
and like the actual workflows and all

861
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,159
that kind of stuff around that time

862
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,360
presuming that legal approves or I

863
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
decide not to listen

864
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,799
all right uh we probably got time for

865
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,059
one more

866
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,039
anybody

867
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,520
please

868
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,520
how do we train people and how often do

869
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,140
we exercise for the clear roles and

870
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,400
responsibilities you want to take it

871
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,620
yeah all the time um hopefully we're not

872
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,120
putting this into practice all the time

873
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,799
uh that's a that's a really good way to

874
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,020
to train Folks up uh but I think one of

875
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,400
the core things that I think this is

876
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,960
something I really want to call Sean out

877
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,000
for doing a really amazing job with is

878
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,640
sort of as we started this Sean is a

879
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,799
veteran Incident Commander here uh he

880
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,120
really took that role of The Incident

881
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,980
Commander to sort of LED as the leader

882
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,320
in the organization said This is how we

883
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,880
do this and so we built a lot of that

884
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,260
stuff and modeled a lot of this stuff

885
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,419
off of how Shauna's do it has done this

886
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,240
and as he's put some of this stuff into

887
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,520
practice we've brought a lot of the more

888
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,020
Junior employees along to sort of

889
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,220
observe that I think there's really

890
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,900
nothing better to do than to really

891
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,640
understand how this stuff gets put into

892
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,100
practice and activated so that's really

893
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,960
one of the ways is making sure that our

894
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,580
our Junior employees are here actually

895
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,640
see Sean or really any uh senior person

896
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,320
in your organization put this stuff into

897
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,779
practice uh the other piece is that yes

898
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,880
we have the specific processes all

899
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,620
documented in outlined mind internally

900
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,899
as well so that folks understand this

901
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,000
and are able to essentially follow along

902
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,980
with what this what the requirements of

903
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,740
that role specifically are in terms of

904
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,779
regularly Drilling and training this is

905
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,520
something that we that we do probably

906
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,679
not as often as we want to

907
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,659
um I think regular drill of this sort of

908
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,159
stuff is is actually incredibly

909
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,140
important it's just sometimes finding

910
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,059
time in an IR shop to do that which we

911
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,559
we find a surprising amount of time

912
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,360
though think about tabletop programs and

913
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,500
all that kind of stuff like there's

914
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,120
there's quite a bit Yeah so one of the

915
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,740
things speaking of tabletop programs

916
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,120
that we actually think is is pretty

917
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,279
important to do as well is to make sure

918
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,840
that you have tabletops with your

919
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,640
Executives using this model or whatever

920
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,500
that you have so when you come up to

921
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,240
some of those big time decisions that

922
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,159
need to be made during an incident you

923
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,720
do need Executive cover for that as

924
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,460
bunny was talking about earlier making

925
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,779
sure that your objectives your

926
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,700
executives are roped in they're telling

927
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,440
you to shut up yeah I'm getting pulled

928
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
off the stage I thought that you're

929
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,960
gonna play the Oscar music to get me off

930
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,059
stage was that no you'll have to come up

931
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,860
and drag them trust me all right all

932
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,360
right thanks everybody so much I

933
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,439
appreciate it we'll be around to talk

934
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,240
thank you
