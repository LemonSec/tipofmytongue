00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:20,760
[Music]

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,880
okay guys so this is my talk on entering

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,500
the cyber security field as a 17 year

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,619
old

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,699
my name is Sullivan Vickers you can just

7
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,159
call me Sully oh this picture here I use

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,480
on everything so if you try to connect

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,460
with me on LinkedIn this is what you'll

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,239
see

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm a content creator at meta CTF and a

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,760
senior at Glen Allen High School

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,860
I was searching for an analogy of what

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,420
getting into the cyber security field at

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,399
a young age is like and this is what I

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,820
came up with

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,140
I was sick about a month ago and I took

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,480
a ton of day cool and NyQuil and I found

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,579
it stupidly hard to tear across the

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,680
perforated lines on these

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,020
on these packets

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,239
and so I I typically always ended up

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,680
using scissors

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,479
similar to cyber security there are

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,100
non-traditional ways to break into the

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,260
field

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,180
before I got into cyber security I

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,640
started out I started my love for it in

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,200
fifth grade

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,180
I started my love for it in fifth grade

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,580
when I when I was introduced to scratch

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,340
through our hour of code program

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,040
just a super easy kid-friendly block

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,140
coding platform that teaches you the

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,119
fundamentals of programming

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,220
in sixth grade I joined the computer

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,460
science club in which I learned HTML CSS

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,220
and python through code academy

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,020
also code academy can be used for adults

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,060
too it gives you a good fundamental

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,720
understanding of everything

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,579
when I when I first got it got into

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,040
cyber security I started out using try

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,079
hack me I'm sure you guys have heard of

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,360
it I started out with a pretty rough

46
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,759
start I spent like a week trying to set

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,740
up my first VM but then another week

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,360
trying to figure out how to connect to

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,479
the VPN and I actually almost gave up

50
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,340
but in the end it was totally worth it

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,020
because it gave me a good understanding

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,598
of how to do a good a good amount of

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,640
things cyber security wise

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,920
I then moved on to hack the box which

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
really challenged my skills and as you

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,220
guys probably know it's it's a good bit

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,379
harder and I took some anti-siphon

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,200
training courses along the way

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,660
my first ttf competition I competed in

60
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,280
the U.S cyber challenge

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,020
in the U.S cyber challenge there's a

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,060
preliminary competition in which you

63
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,099
have to analyze a packet capture with

64
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,480
Wireshark and then answer a bunch of

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
questions

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
the top performer in this the top

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,280
performers in this competition are

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,560
invited to a week-long camp with various

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
Sans instructors

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,340
and in addition to the the technical

71
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,560
content there's also a resume writing

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,620
course uh CIO and CSO panel

73
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,560
and then a job fair

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,959
um uscc is open to all ages so anyone

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,060
can participate and I highly suggest you

76
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,140
do

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,459
at the end of the week There's a three

78
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,860
hour long CTF and my team actually ended

79
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,420
up winning the CTF

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,879
and so we we were invited to the Cyber

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,900
ball

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,400
in the Cyber ball they give you a

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
vulnerability two weeks in advance

84
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,180
and then you you study the vulnerability

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,040
and develop a sort of risk assessment

86
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,659
and give it to a present give a

87
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,120
presentation to a panel of judges

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
following that there's a 24-hour long

89
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,659
CTF

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,879
we were then invited to DC in which we

91
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,340
got to tour scissors sock we got we got

92
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,959
to go to a dinner sponsored by Maximus

93
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,400
and network with like all sorts of

94
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
people

95
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,180
and we went to the ACT IX cyber Summit

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,700
so you can check out uh

97
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,239
uscybertallenge.org if you want to

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,540
participate and I highly suggest you do

99
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,099
high school and college competitions

100
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,720
there are there are a ton of high school

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,519
and college competitions like CCDC

102
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,739
there's there's a ton more but I

103
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,379
competed in a the national cyber League

104
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,060
if you haven't heard of it there's a gym

105
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,040
that opens up about a month before the

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,319
competition and you get to practice your

107
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,599
CTF skills and really understand how it

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,739
all works

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,019
following that there's a weekend-long

110
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,819
individual competition

111
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,159
and then and then another weekend long

112
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,780
team competition

113
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,060
this is more of a Resume Builder but

114
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,620
it's it's certainly worthwhile

115
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,139
so I started my the high school club the

116
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,459
cyber security club of my high school

117
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,858
and as you can see that's the link to

118
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,060
our website there

119
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,979
initially it was really hard to get a

120
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,259
teacher sponsor because no one wants to

121
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,419
to sponsor a club that's based around

122
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,880
hacking because hacking has that has

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,560
that horrible

124
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,440
the horrible stigma around it and so I

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,000
ended up talking to the principal and I

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,040
convinced him I wrote up this set of

127
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
rules basically saying No One's Gonna Do

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,400
anything bad or else they get kicked out

129
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,100
and and he was okay with it

130
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,800
so I talked to the head of Tech for a

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,780
county and he actually wouldn't let us

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,759
get Wireshark I wanted to use it just to

133
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,320
teach people how to analyze packet

134
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,479
captures and he saw it as a security

135
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,860
risk

136
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,720
what what lots of people in education

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,660
need to do is weigh the risk and reward

138
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,220
on this sort of thing

139
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
of course it can be dangerous

140
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
But ultimately it can teach you

141
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,860
fundamental skills on how to get into

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,720
the workforce

143
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,460
I resulted in using cyber start America

144
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,860
since it doesn't use many penetration

145
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,780
testing tools and it consists mostly of

146
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,440
source code analysis and cryptography

147
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,479
and there's actually also a sand

148
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,880
scholarship if you if you uh score high

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,000
enough and so you can get a free stance

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,699
Foundation scores

151
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,800
we also had various speakers one of them

152
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,660
being the chief technology evangelist of

153
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,880
coptia as well as a few from Bank of

154
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,780
America

155
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,580
they spoke on how to get into cyber

156
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,199
security as well as what entry-level

157
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,979
positions are available

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,419
oh also here's my video that I used to

159
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:46,979
market the club the world relies on

160
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,300
technology

161
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,080
what's vulnerable everything

162
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,460
infrastructure Finance smart technology

163
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,780
everything is connected so everything is

164
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,940
at risk during the going out in high

165
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,100
school cyber security club today make

166
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,360
the world a safer place

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,440
[Music]

168
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,539
so we actually had someone in charge of

169
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,880
marketing as well because it it's kind

170
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,620
of a big deal like if nobody knows about

171
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,000
a club at your school no one's going to

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,100
join

173
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm currently working at meta CTF as a

174
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,759
content creator and I have been since

175
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,900
January

176
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,240
I started out auditing the anti-slip in

177
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,220
cyber range and I would go through and

178
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,960
I'd check all the challenges for grammar

179
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,580
functionality and like learning

180
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,860
Effectiveness I then created summary

181
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,479
files and put them in our gitlab

182
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,100
Repository

183
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,620
from there I moved on to redeveloping

184
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,259
our privacy policy to comply with gdpr

185
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:41,699
standards as well as the newer

186
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,860
California privacy laws as you've

187
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,300
probably seen on lots of websites now

188
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,280
they have the consent to cookies button

189
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,900
that you the super annoying button that

190
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
you have to click every time you come on

191
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,539
the website

192
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,120
and currently now I'm actually working

193
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,500
on creating ctfs

194
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,240
I got I got the chance to participate in

195
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,100
the anti-siphon office hours live stream

196
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,319
it was on Powershell for infosec with

197
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,539
with uh Kerry Roberts

198
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,520
this was actually the first time that I

199
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,039
had the opportunity to learn one-on-one

200
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,380
with some sort of teacher or someone

201
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,600
that's a professional in the field

202
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
I think companies should open up

203
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
opportunities like this to other people

204
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,300
there aren't many of these

205
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,560
and they can help people a lot

206
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,639
now I haven't started well starting in

207
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,080
June I have an internship at a fortune

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,680
300 company

209
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,300
so age is just the number

210
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,400
as you can probably guess I had lots of

211
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,199
issues doing things with my age like

212
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,300
like participating in anything

213
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,680
some things you can't change like

214
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,860
getting a hotel room or a rental car but

215
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,539
other things you can

216
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,880
I tried to participate in the alpha

217
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,740
omega Federal networking day

218
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,419
and I was actually initially rejected

219
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,300
because I I'm not currently pursuing a

220
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
bachelor's degree because that's kind of

221
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,220
hard to as a high schooler so

222
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,979
yeah so so what I ended up doing was

223
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,440
sending them my resume and saying okay

224
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,720
so sure I'm not currently pursuing a

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,639
college degree but can you substitute

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,780
this

227
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,979
what you can do is you can think outside

228
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,840
of the box you can reach out to

229
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,360
recruiters directly and say hey while I

230
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,740
may not be doing what everyone else is

231
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,440
doing here's something else

232
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,060
and then after that

233
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,479
I also got rejected again unfortunately

234
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,340
because I'm not 18. so what I did is I

235
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,680
asked to bring a chaperone and I brought

236
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
one of my friends who recently recently

237
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,219
got out of the military

238
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,839
and so he actually ended up getting a

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,820
job interview after it

240
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,120
look but majority of the time it doesn't

241
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,458
end out the end up that well uh my dad's

242
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,779
right there I have to bring him

243
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,700
everywhere

244
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
um and so I always can't go to stuff

245
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,779
like because he has to take off work and

246
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,399
you know it's kind of a big deal

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,620
um we drove five hours to come here

248
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm located in Richmond Virginia

249
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
so yeah but what companies can do is

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,339
they can come to schools instead of

251
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,860
bringing people to them

252
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,620
so in this way basically people can get

253
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,700
some sort of an education

254
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,740
so I networked a lot and networking is

255
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,880
super important in the cyber security

256
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,160
field because it's hard to get into and

257
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
connections can really get you places so

258
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,120
here's some of the companies I talk to

259
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,240
so I talked to a lot of people

260
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,220
I enjoy it

261
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,339
and I I suggest you guys do it as well

262
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,100
so here's some tips that I have

263
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,959
for LinkedIn whenever you connect with

264
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,540
someone you don't know send a note

265
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,220
in your connection request you have the

266
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,300
option to send a note if you don't

267
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,399
already know this and what you can do is

268
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,560
say hey here's a little info about me

269
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
here's why I want to connect with you

270
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
and do you think you'd have a time to

271
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,279
call with me at some point in the future

272
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,019
and something else you can do is find

273
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,060
commonalities so let's say I've recently

274
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
stopped teaching and I'm looking to get

275
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,019
into the cyber security field

276
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:59,459
what I can do is I can look through

277
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,560
their job experience and if I see that

278
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,600
they were also a teacher and they made

279
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,339
that jump to cyber security I can bring

280
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,560
that up in my note and ask specific

281
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
questions based on that and then they're

282
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,680
more likely to accept that connection

283
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,240
request

284
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,100
keep a list

285
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,779
there are obviously going to be lots of

286
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,580
people you want to talk to and if you

287
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,019
roll out like a hundred connection

288
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,180
requests in like one weekend you're not

289
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,800
gonna be able to talk to all of them

290
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,839
so keep a list and gradually roll them

291
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,060
out and then eventually you can set up

292
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,100
calls and conversations

293
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,200
adjust your vertical so if I'm trying to

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
talk to the CSO of Google he's probably

295
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,640
not going to respond

296
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,019
and so

297
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,399
so what I can do is I can move down a

298
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,019
level maybe I go to the deputy C so

299
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,820
maybe I go to the head of red team those

300
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,080
are all good options and you can

301
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,500
honestly learn a lot from them

302
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,060
so you've already made that initial

303
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,260
connection and now you're ready to have

304
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,180
a call or meet them in person

305
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,980
as you're going to be driving majority

306
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,540
of the conversation you want to prepare

307
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,640
questions ahead of time

308
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,459
come into the call with a set list of

309
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,540
things you want to learn from this

310
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,560
person

311
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,320
be engaged something you want to do is

312
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,180
be present in the conversation you want

313
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,800
to ask questions about their questions

314
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,160
and ask them to expand on their answers

315
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,140
ask for an introduction if they bring

316
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,000
someone up in the conversation something

317
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,920
you may want to do is ask if they can

318
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,360
introduce you to them

319
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,320
because if you're making a connection

320
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,000
request to someone that you don't know

321
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,279
on LinkedIn they may not accept it but

322
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,839
if it's a connection made from a

323
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,300
co-worker or a friend that's you're

324
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,560
you're more likely to get in touch with

325
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,820
them

326
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,200
follow up

327
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,240
your meeting ask if you can follow up in

328
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
six months this is of course if it was a

329
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,500
good meeting asked to follow up in six

330
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,399
months

331
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,440
this way you can maintain that initial

332
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,600
relationship and be thankful these

333
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,519
people are taking time out of their day

334
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,100
to talk to you and they don't honestly

335
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,579
owe you anything

336
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,320
after you've had that call create a

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,700
spreadsheet you want to retain this

338
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,839
important information that you've

339
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,800
gathered

340
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,300
so what I've done is I made a

341
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,040
spreadsheet with the name of the person

342
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,860
the role and the company they work for

343
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,600
as well as the date I talk to them the

344
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,339
reason for the conversation and my three

345
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,440
main takeaways

346
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
what this does is let's say I meet you

347
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,700
in person again and I have no clue who

348
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,839
you are then I can just pull up that

349
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,320
spreadsheet and you're just right there

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
so for that six month follow-up you want

351
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,100
to set a reminder on your calendar

352
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,440
you will probably forget if you have

353
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,980
that reminder there then you're good

354
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,540
send a thank you this goes back to that

355
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,860
thankfulness thing

356
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,779
you really you really want to be

357
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,519
thankful and Express gratitude toward

358
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,839
towards whoever's talking to you

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,740
so what are the common one of the

360
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,300
questions commonly asked is should I

361
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,920
even get a college degree

362
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,500
you get a really mixed bag of answers if

363
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
you talk to people in the public sector

364
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,620
typically they'll be like yeah you need

365
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,000
a degree

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,100
um private sector I've noticed is more

367
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,839
lenient they're more okay

368
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,820
with you not having a degree

369
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,519
what you can do is substitute that with

370
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,440
other experience

371
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,720
for example certifications

372
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,339
if you haven't seen this this is Paul

373
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,620
Jeremy's certification map I made a tiny

374
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,760
URL there

375
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,860
basically what this map does is it shows

376
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,139
you how hard each certification is what

377
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,420
categories of cyber security it hits and

378
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,180
if you click on any certification it'll

379
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,139
actually

380
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,720
it'll actually take you to the website

381
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,579
so if you just want to look at the link

382
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,939
real quick

383
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,860
make your own experience something else

384
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,660
you can do is write articles on medium

385
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,000
or LinkedIn compete in ctfs you can

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
check out ctftime.org they have a whole

387
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,220
list of like a billion ctfs and what you

388
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,540
can do is you can go for the bigger ones

389
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,579
as they look better on a resume

390
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,000
Azure and AWS offer free 12-month

391
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,740
services and you can practice setting up

392
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,420
an Ubuntu server or a Honeypot or

393
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,680
something

394
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,959
you can contribute to your GitHub code

395
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,540
repository just to develop a portfolio

396
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,040
there you can also contribute to open

397
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,079
source projects these all look really

398
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,300
good and they honestly really stand out

399
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,040
on a resume rather than saying I've

400
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,839
studied for this you can say I did this

401
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,980
make your Bad resume sexy

402
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,019
so coming into any career you're not

403
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,360
going to have anything on your resume

404
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,399
and as you can see here these codes do

405
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,839
this these scripts do the same exact

406
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,380
thing but one looks way better

407
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,120
so don't be Craig

408
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,339
's resume is super Bland it's black and

409
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,620
white sure he may have more content than

410
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,579
I do

411
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,620
but at least mine looks pretty if a

412
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,760
recruiter is looking through a stack of

413
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,920
papers and they keep seeing black and

414
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,180
white resume after black and white

415
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,500
resume after black and white resume

416
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,060
they'll see this one and they'll be like

417
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,860
whoa

418
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,899
that one actually looks a lot better and

419
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,420
you can also include links if it's a PDF

420
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,040
so to wrap things up here

421
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,260
you can come in through the back of your

422
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,420
DayQuil you don't necessarily have to

423
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,399
come in tearing through the perforated

424
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,800
lines like they suggest you to

425
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
foreign

426
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
take one thing away from this talk

427
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
remember to make sure you only sound

428
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,199
stupid once coming into any career

429
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,600
you're expected to sound ignorant and

430
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,100
you're also

431
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,420
they're expected to sound ignorant

432
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,860
you're going to ask stupid questions and

433
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,300
you're going to feel stupid

434
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,399
but remember the answers to your stupid

435
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,320
questions this way you don't feel stupid

436
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,180
again

437
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,860
thank you guys for listening do you guys

438
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,339
have any questions

439
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,399
what's up

440
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,680
what games did I make in scratch

441
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,940
oh

442
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,880
so I actually in fifth grade I made one

443
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,500
based on Five Nights at Freddy's if

444
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,260
you've heard of that it was horrible it

445
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,579
was horrible but

446
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,719
it taught me a lot

447
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,839
it's a question

448
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,699
home is

449
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,220
on black so for a home lab something you

450
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,839
can do is you can set up a network you

451
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,459
can with like a router let's say even

452
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,260
extra router laying around the house

453
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,500
what do I do what do I have so I've just

454
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,480
messed around with Azure and AWS pretty

455
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,760
much I don't I don't like yeah yeah in

456
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,480
some ways yeah

457
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,160
answer questions

458
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,699
sorry

459
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,639
I was just saying he didn't mention gcp

460
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,120
you got to get all the clouds

461
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,639
what was your question

462
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,839
how many languages do I know

463
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,639
um so I know the fundamentals of a good

464
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,800
number of languages I'm not necessarily

465
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,260
crazy good at a specific one like I

466
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,139
don't know like I knew HTML CSS python

467
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,600
and a little bit of C plus plus as well

468
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,459
and then I can typically just look

469
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,540
through another language and be like

470
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,240
okay I understand that but I I don't

471
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,459
necessarily know how to just code from

472
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,220
scratch so yeah

473
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,940
it's your question

474
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,720
so do I have any cyber security courses

475
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
at my high school I have a computer

476
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
science course

477
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,940
um it's just Java and it's it's pretty

478
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,160
bad

479
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,579
like we code we code on paper

480
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,679
we don't use a compiler

481
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,160
we just write it all out

482
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,579
yeah yeah no syntax highlighting nothing

483
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,260
it's pretty brutal

484
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,199
so no cyber security courses at all no

485
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,699
so he's clear enough to use Visual

486
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,939
Studio

487
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,980
okay

488
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,319
what really got your student cyber

489
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
security why are you striving so hard

490
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,940
so what got me interested in cyber

491
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,919
security I've always been interested in

492
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,380
I.T and I was bored and so I looked up

493
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,500
how to hack

494
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,720
and then it just it it really interested

495
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,580
me from there and I got like addicted

496
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,880
and I did a ton of ctfs I like figuring

497
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,220
out how things work when I was younger I

498
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,500
would take apart a pen and not know how

499
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,780
to put it back together but just to see

500
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,039
how it works

501
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,539
so we have like a bunch of broken bins

502
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,220
lying around the house but

503
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah

504
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,120
I can't see you the light

505
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,280
oh

506
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
um Mr Robot that's more of a TV show

507
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,640
though but and there's also well

508
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,539
actually War Games technically but yeah

509
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,500
yeah

510
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,059
okay

511
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,039
well oh sorry go ahead

512
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,840
yeah that's one way to do it but also if

513
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
you're going through

514
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,620
if you're going through like

515
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,220
so let's say you see a job a job opening

516
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,720
online what you can do is you can go

517
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,620
through

518
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,720
and look at the keywords in the resume

519
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
and just put that in yours I think

520
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,020
they'll still pick it up and honestly

521
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,299
majority of the time with my resume

522
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,799
it won't get picked up and I'll get

523
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,080
rejected straight away so what I do is I

524
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,640
just go and message someone at the

525
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,200
company or the recruiter and say hey can

526
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,460
I talk to you

527
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,960
so yeah I think that's a better way to

528
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,080
go

529
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,320
depression

530
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,419
we used

531
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,120
yeah we used cyberstart it was called

532
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,400
cyber start America yeah

533
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,320
and it's open to high schoolers I think

534
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,700
you may be able to do it if you're

535
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
younger but I'm not sure about that

536
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,900
okay

537
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,100
so that's your question

538
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,299
I'm sorry what'd you say

539
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,179
I've I've always emailed them but I'm

540
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,440
sure you can do both and I'm sure

541
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,720
they'll probably print them out

542
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,960
like at the actual workplace so I always

543
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,100

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,700
