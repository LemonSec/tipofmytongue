1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
foreign

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:21,000
[Music]

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,600
I am going to start now it is officially

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,160
five o'clock

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,199
so first of all I see a lot of familiar

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,060
faces in the crowd who stopped by the

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,460
four Trace Booth today I'm amazed that

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,620
after hearing my diatribes there you

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,300
decided to come hear me talk again so

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
it's truly an honor but also why you

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
know you've heard me talk already

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,620
it's not that exciting so who I am I'm

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,180
Nick you might have seen me at the four

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,920
Trace Booth I'm the founder and CEO of a

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,780
company called Fortress

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,899
um we look for data leaks basically I'm

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,700
the former VP of threat research at a

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,260
fishing and anti-fishing company called

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,719
pixum and if you have questions about

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,059
the talk or just want to chat with me uh

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,620
that's my email and you can find me on

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,780
Twitter or Mastodon at Nick backwards

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,479
casein418.

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,040
but what I want to talk about today

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,900
starts with the world of data leaks

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,820
which is where I spend an overwhelming

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,220
majority of my time

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,100
and some of those graphics on the left

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,439
are mostly screenshots uh from Forum

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,140
posts recently selling uh you know

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,360
recycled credentials uh selling access

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,140
to things or just posting uh leaks

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,900
and I think of the last like four major

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,000
incidents right press worthy uh findings

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
of large amounts of corporate data on

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,720
the internet which the ones that come to

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,640
mind immediately are like the TSA no fly

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,540
list

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,939
the T-Mobile leak

40
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,619
um some massive education system

41
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,460
platform in India like a a ton of their

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,200
their customer information leak the

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
student information leaked and then

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,619
Salesforce had something like this week

45
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,079
or some customer attendant stuff was

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,759
leaking

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
um and in in basically every case there

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,820
we're talking about uh the crown jewels

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,160
so to speak of the organization that the

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
product of the breach or leak which are

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,879
different things being found just online

52
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,800
anyone with an internet connection and

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
an IP address can find those things

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,860
they're we're not talking about

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,720
post-exploitation Frameworks or custom

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,239
tooling or like very Advanced

57
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,160
persistence mechanisms we're talking

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,120
about just a a Google dork and some very

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,540
patient scrolling to get to uh the Crown

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,760
Jewel which is something that's hard to

61
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,980
imagine because a lot of us spend our

62
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,340
time in a very like whatever Dr xdr MDR

63
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,959
Sim

64
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,660
detection content World spending and

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,879
this is something I'm guilty of uh an

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,680
inappropriate amount of time writing

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,920
like Sigma rules for detection scenarios

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,260
that are probably never going to happen

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,599
and have like happened once in the wild

70
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,120
so it's hard to imagine that uh the

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,220
impact that we're trying to prevent uh

72
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,519
as of late has just been straight up

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,980
someone finding a file on the internet

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,459
which leads me to uh crown jewels now

75
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,980
old crown jewels and I'm saying 2010 is

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,599
old so you're gonna have to deal with

77
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,720
that uh are things that sat on like the

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,519
crown jewels have passed say it's files

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
or data specifically used to maybe sit

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,140
on the Intranet

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,840
in an application server uh that's

82
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
hosting some file share software that's

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,879
like very clinical and super locked down

84
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,040
it is not accessible from the internet

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,379
at least in theory and like in practice

86
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,200
you can try that and you've got like the

87
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,040
you know 2010 like super

88
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,019
well-configured McAfee or Symantec DLP

89
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,840
deployment and some fim software running

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
on the host to keep things locked down

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,180
so you can see the data when it moves

92
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,580
now the crown jewels of today are a

93
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,580
little more dinky and pathetic and often

94
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,400
are accessible simply uh from the

95
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,239
internet

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,700
so a lot of them live now in places like

97
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,560
SharePoint online

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
um in G Suite tenants

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,720
um in Salesforce tenants in uh any

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,579
number of infrastructure as a service

101
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,180
provider bucket storage options

102
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,220
um and in a lot of cases especially the

103
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,020
ones I just shared and in ones I'm sure

104
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,180
many of you have seen in your day jobs

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,880
are accessible by anyone with an IP

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,940
address due to whatever software you're

107
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,759
using to host it being sort of open to

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,940
the Internet by default this is

109
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,540
extraordinarily common with

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,979
infrastructure as a service providers

111
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,660
which is starting to be buttoned up now

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,820
but in the case of SharePoint online a

113
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,979
lot of the stuff uh I see

114
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,440
in my day-to-day job which uh you know

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
gets wrapped up before it hits the news

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,820
even though these people have Cosby's is

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
someone clicking as an example share via

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,919
URL on like a SharePoint directory which

119
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,840
uh not just a file like a directory

120
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,300
which makes the whole thing uh open to

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,780
the public and oftentimes is indexed by

122
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
a search engine so again the right

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,699
Google dork a week later and anyone just

124
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,160
patient enough to find it can find that

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
file

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,759
um and then the casby in in some of

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,800
these specific examples is not connected

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,360
to the tenant there's no forward proxy

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,979
so they're not seeing that like the

130
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,360
marketing department has their own

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,860
SharePoint instance that is build

132
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,900
totally separate from the corporate one

133
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,419
and no one knows it exists

134
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,680
so the the trend I've observed here is a

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,259
shift left and no it's not the buzzwordy

136
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,360
devsecops shift left that you might be

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
thinking

138
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
it's a shift left uh though you know

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,520
there's there's a time and a place for

140
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,800
that it's a shift left on something a

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,660
little bit more familiar uh to this

142
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
audience this is the miter attack

143
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,020
framework

144
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,360
um on the left you've got your recon

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,520
techniques on the right you've got you

146
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
know all of the things to get access to

147
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,560
your crown jewels and then x-fill them

148
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,840
now this is where in all of the

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,820
exercises that I've done in an oh you

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,940
know for most of my career this is the

151
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,479
uh this is the stage where the the thing

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,220
is found and the thing the Crown Jewel

153
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,199
the target the whatever of the of the

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,300
pen test or the actual adversarial

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,220
activity this is what we're looking for

156
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,919
as the end product the end result of the

157
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,240
engagement the end result of an

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,100
adversary being in there is what did

159
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,060
they take

160
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,520
what did they leave with

161
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,139
um and in uh in reality the the shift

162
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,479
left that I'm talking about uh is

163
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
adversaries basically succeeding in the

164
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
goal of this entire chain of x-fill in

165
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,100
the first phase at all which is the

166
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,620
reconnaissance phase now the answer to

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,940
this problem

168
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,060
is sort of Performing assessments using

169
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,280
a different framework which has now been

170
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,840
merged into the attack framework but

171
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,000
previously this was a separate Matrix

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,699
called the pre- attack Matrix now a lot

173
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:00,900
of you I'm sure are familiar with the

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,600
attack matrix it's all of the ttps for

175
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,120
you know everything in in your ideal Sim

176
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,819
deployment you've got uh you've got some

177
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,340
detection Logic for an overwhelming

178
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,139
majority of the ttps in the miter attack

179
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,020
framework the idea behind pre-attack is

180
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,539
all of the things that happen before a

181
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,080
bad guy gets access which I think are

182
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,660
woefully under appreciated uh in the

183
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,419
modern era so the pre-attack Matrix has

184
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,699
two categories uh reconnaissance and

185
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,080
resource development resource

186
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,940
development is like active stuff this is

187
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,440
active scans you're gonna you're gonna

188
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,259
get logs cut on systems from this

189
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,020
activity but the reconnaissance phase is

190
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,759
what not only informs resource

191
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,639
development but is what informs

192
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,660
everything else

193
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,520
so the reconnaissance phase there is

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,620
active portions to it and there are

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,039
really active flavors of ttps to get any

196
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,620
particular goal you want done here

197
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,479
um but a lot of it is passive a lot of

198
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,460
it is stuff that is not going to cut so

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,500
much as a log

200
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,240
um in anything that you're tracking so

201
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
you have the the greatest detection

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Logic on Earth for you know

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,020
um if someone does land on a box and you

204
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,979
know tries to use uh uh cert util to

205
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,020
download some file from somewhere else

206
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,940
uh you'll detect that in a second you'll

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,560
detect much more advanced iterations of

208
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,580
that

209
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,639
um but like a lot of the things they use

210
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,379
to get to that point to just plan the

211
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,879
attack to get to that point you're not

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,620
going to see anything from now a good

213
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,840
example that will cut a few logs is that

214
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,360
last TTP on the list or the last topic

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
on the list a search victim-owned

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,659
websites

217
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,760
so I'll walk through the example of just

218
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,179
how easy it is all of the ttps in Recon

219
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,120
are so incredibly important in in the

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,580
results they produce in that they inform

221
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,800
the rest of the adversaries activity in

222
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
your environment you know with with a

223
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,980
smaller footprint they're making a lot

224
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,899
more noise on a lot fewer sources to try

225
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,940
and you know knock on your door

226
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,740
but as an example let's talk about

227
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,600
searching a victim-owned website and

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,760
just how easy it is so let's say we have

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,500
a Google dork man that's really tiny

230
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,320
text but the idea is a Google dork to

231
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,560
look for files PowerPoints spreadsheets

232
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
docs PDFs on corporate on corporate

233
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,260
infrastructure any domain or subdomain

234
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,420
associated with who I'm Dorking this

235
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,920
particular dork

236
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,500
uh was a company that say as an example

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,540
is hosting a b-sides conference uh maybe

238
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,740
they're a hotel chain I don't know that

239
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,240
would be in poor taste but so that's not

240
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,820
what we're doing but as an example

241
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,700
and say 2 000 Files come up and I start

242
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,440
downloading them I can do this by hand I

243
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,060
can write a million different scripts to

244
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,339
do this there's Pi meta in fact as a in

245
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,540
power meta there's a Powershell version

246
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,279
a python version that'll pull all these

247
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,620
files down uh procedurally it won't get

248
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,640
all the way through but it'll get a

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,200
bunch of them

250
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,760
um so I download these files I've got

251
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
spreadsheets I've got PowerPoints I've

252
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,540
got word docs I've got PDFs and I start

253
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,700
pulling the exif data out of them now X

254
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,160
if data is like

255
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,660
um if you're familiar with pulling

256
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,640
geolocate people pulling geolocation

257
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
stuff from a photo X if data is like the

258
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,140
longitudinal and longitudinal

259
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,839
coordinates attached to a picture there

260
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,240
is exif data that can be ripped out of

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,760
uh it's not always actually exif but

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,040
metadata that can be ripped out of an

263
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,899
overwhelming majority of file types that

264
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,000
will tell you something about that file

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,860
being created now all of that metadata

266
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,040
can also be stripped using uh utility

267
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,080
called exif tool there's a specific

268
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,899
command to strip that metadata

269
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,000
but if you don't do that which I have

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,580
not found anyone who does except like a

271
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,980
few wildly Advanced security operations

272
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,120
centers who have that built into a

273
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,019
process

274
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,760
you can get all kinds of Juicy stuff

275
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,339
from the files so particularly the

276
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,320
author field which occasionally will

277
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,600
contain uh like an actual credential

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,220
like a Sam account name something

279
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,380
associated with some IDP or IAM

280
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,540
infrastructure which I've got two

281
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,040
examples of here which you know these

282
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,620
are sanitized obviously

283
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,660
um or emails sometimes it's a first and

284
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,339
last name the more valuable for us is

285
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,920
emails and usernames we also get the

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,500
tools and not only just the tools but

287
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,240
typically the version of the tool that's

288
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,279
running uh sometimes down to like

289
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,899
specific version numbers in that last

290
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,360
Creator tool example we have the dll

291
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,540
involved in the publication of the file

292
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,200
which is

293
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
interesting and not something that I

294
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
expected before I got into this little

295
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,899
world and also in that last one we have

296
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,100
uh

297
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,440
the operating system version the version

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
of the OS that's running on this host so

299
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
taking all of the fields from from uh

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,180
all of the files that we found which in

301
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,880
in this example is 2000 this is just

302
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,339
from three that I pulled down at random

303
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,079
because they were different file types I

304
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,459
can put together

305
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,660
a really interesting inventory of uh

306
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,459
organizational metadata and

307
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,680
organizational data in general that

308
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
exists online so just from a handful of

309
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,579
files I get a list of usernames that I

310
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,620
can start plugging into stuff maybe for

311
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,720
sprays maybe for Brute Forces maybe just

312
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,220
to see if they're active accounts I've

313
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,140
got an email address which is cool very

314
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
common to be in file metadata and more

315
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,880
interestingly I've got a list of tools

316
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,040
and libraries and Os versions and

317
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,019
sometimes dlls so the idea is I can from

318
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,640
the outside completely unauthenticated

319
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,180
start to put together as a bad guy a

320
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,279
list of things to Target with my payload

321
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,320
so I can not only with the files be

322
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,420
really specific about who I Target but I

323
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,100
can start putting together with this

324
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,899
inventory of software running on the

325
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,839
inside a sort of like idea of what the

326
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,760
gold image laptop looks like that gets

327
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,620
deployed within the organization what is

328
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,060
running on it what libraries are

329
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,459
installed on it what version of word is

330
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,680
on it what Suites are they using you

331
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,079
start to get a really good idea

332
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,720
of what is going on inside the company

333
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,040
get a lay of the land of what's actually

334
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,779
going on on the corporate laptops being

335
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,480
used to produce these files

336
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,700
uh now this is something that should be

337
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,279
and often is a part of regular old pen

338
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,200
test reconnaissance typically for an

339
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
external a fully external engagement uh

340
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,540
and I think the the most important part

341
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,760
of the Recon phase and the reason I

342
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
think this should just be the the actual

343
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,959
action of this whether it's just you

344
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,360
know your team doing it by hand should

345
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,160
be woven into the fabric of of

346
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,760
monitoring is because the Recon phase is

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,079
what informs the rest of the attack

348
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,000
without you know with a limited amount

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,680
of Recon findings there's a limited

350
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,480
amount of attack paths to actually

351
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,820
exhaust uh and you might have to go ask

352
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,459
the person you're on the engagement with

353
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,920
um for additional routes in uh if you're

354
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,079
doing a full external or additional

355
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,360
options because you didn't find much

356
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,760
and also I hinted at this earlier but if

357
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,680
you limit the amount of domains out

358
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,420
there which this Recon ends up revealing

359
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,920
a lot of sub-domains a lot of content

360
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,779
that that maybe shouldn't be on the

361
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,579
internet when you limit the amount of

362
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,980
sources uh that a red team a pen test

363
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,680
team or an actual adversary have uh to

364
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,779
exhaust to try and get in they end up

365
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,079
making more noise in less places so if

366
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,519
you're doing you know different flavors

367
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,860
of long tail analysis on your logs or

368
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,720
looking for spikes in activity it's a

369
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,399
lot easier to detect when it's not

370
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,440
spread out wide across you know if

371
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,180
you're a huge company you've got so many

372
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,040
web resources out there when you've got

373
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,660
a smaller amount of usernames to pick

374
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,459
from because there's not like you know

375
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,380
200 that they're pulling from metadata

376
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,120
but there's like three or there's no

377
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
usernames out there at all and they're

378
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
just guessing them from email naming

379
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,540
conventions uh it becomes significantly

380
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,620
easier

381
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,120
to detect

382
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,019
uh now I'm going to provide this is

383
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,000
practical knowledge

384
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,700
to start looking at pre-attack as a

385
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,100
framework to assess yourself against in

386
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,199
the same way you do the rest of the

387
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,019
attack Matrix now for ttps in the actual

388
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,060
Enterprise attack matrix it's really

389
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,459
easy to to figure out how to assess

390
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,560
yourself against it because it's like do

391
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,839
I have a detection for this or not do I

392
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
have the sources to provide me with the

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,519
logs to detect this or not it's a lot of

394
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,860
pretty easy yes or no Flips For The

395
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,600
pre-attack Matrix we're not really

396
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,480
talking about checking a detection box

397
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,240
because a lot of these are techniques

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
that are done on systems that aren't

399
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,120
owned by you and you're not collecting

400
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,399
logs from at all so the the detection

401
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,880
use case you know only vaguely exists

402
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,639
the what I think you should do is run

403
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,699
the ttps against yourself on some

404
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,220
rotating time-based Cadence whether it's

405
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,079
a different member of your team doing

406
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,880
things like searching for corporate data

407
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,760
or honey tokens in open buckets with

408
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
like specific Google Docs looking for

409
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,540
exposed SharePoint files in your

410
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,279
infrastructure or in Associated

411
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
infrastructure of people who have access

412
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,240
to your SharePoint tenant uh different

413
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,760
flavors of dorks exploitdb has tons and

414
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,740
tons of really valuable ones

415
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,600
scanning the content you do find online

416
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,420
for exif data and metadata that gives

417
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,740
you some sort of insight into what's

418
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,320
going on inside the company and with the

419
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,660
goal really of understanding what exists

420
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,639
online if an adversary were to look at

421
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,519
you right now what exactly would they

422
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,500
find it's helpful to understand that and

423
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,880
makes it a little more predictive the

424
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,199
kind of activity that's going to go on

425
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,720
when you do engage a red team for an

426
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,180
external or a pen test you know a fully

427
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,560
external pen test

428
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
and what I'd also like to advocate for

429
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
because it's something that I I saw so

430
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
much when I worked in Consulting is this

431
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
is not something you want to wait for

432
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
the report results to patch up because

433
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,980
the reality is most of the time in the

434
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,260
the couple pages of Recon you get back I

435
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,639
mean the assessment

436
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,260
the stuff that they found is stuff you

437
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,940
could have patched up months ago and

438
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,620
would never have been the path that they

439
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,060
took to get in they would have had to

440
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,380
find something else potentially

441
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,459
something a lot more complicated

442
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,720
potentially something that would have

443
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,759
produced you know significantly larger

444
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,800
volume of logs

445
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,560
and I think using you know doing the

446
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,000
sort of pre-attack Assessments against

447
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,860
yourself is a good way to get started

448
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,860
with threat and form defense which is a

449
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,560
sort of a buzzwordy category and topic

450
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,440
but the idea is prioritizing your

451
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,420
Investments prioritizing your training

452
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,000
prioritizing the purple Team and Red

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,820
Team test cases you engage in

454
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,579
um by what is actually going on in the

455
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,459
wild and what tools are adversaries and

456
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,280
what ttps are adversaries actually using

457
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,980
against companies like yours and people

458
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,000
in your vertical so I propose being very

459
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
specific not only about the ttps that

460
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,439
they might be using on the inside but

461
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,380
the while it seems so simple it's so

462
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,959
common for them to be finding things

463
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,880
um on the outside that negate the need

464
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,919
to ever get inside at all and to make

465
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,660
this easier I think using honey tokens

466
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,580
is a great idea put honey tokens in in

467
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,980
every data set you can and are able to

468
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,480
and search for the presence if you don't

469
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,860
want to search for organizational data

470
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,480
over like public sources because you

471
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,740
don't want to put organizational data

472
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,200
out there putting honey tokens embedding

473
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,059
it into you know a variety of different

474
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,000
flavors of tokens into you know code you

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,280
have account databases you have username

476
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,900
databases you have is a great way where

477
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,220
you can just search for that it's not

478
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,500
proprietary the token itself search for

479
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,660
the presence of that token in public

480
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,460
data sets which is something you can do

481
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,500
you know again with uh with a search

482
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,039
engine or with the exposed apis of a

483
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,780
wide variety of tools

484
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,179
and then on a quarterly basis I think

485
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,860
everyone should be running table tops or

486
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,840
at least adding this into your list of

487
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,940
tabletop scenarios especially with the

488
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,799
popularity of of public data leaks over

489
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,720
the last couple months usually not of a

490
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,580
parent organization leaking data but of

491
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,559
a provider they work with accidentally

492
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,080
leaking their data I think it's a super

493
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,580
valuable

494
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,840
um test case and tabletop scenario to be

495
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,679
walking through because it usually is uh

496
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,960
more procedural and more focused in the

497
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,679
Privacy office and legal office

498
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,960
then a lot of other tabletop scenarios

499
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,720
end up being and it's also incredibly

500
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,260
likely uh or at least increasingly

501
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,020
likely to happen as we've observed in

502
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,860
the wild

503
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,080
so that's it those are the steps and

504
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,280
this was supposed to be a short

505
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,539
presentation it was a little longer than

506
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,160
I intended

507
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,900
um but that's it that's the end of the

508
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,460
talk I'll open the floor for questions

509
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,980
comments on Tim the head will also be

510
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,080
taking questions

511
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,580
it doesn't speak much but

512
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,840
yes

513
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,260
are already developed

514
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,660
I've got people who can't do this stuff

515
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,179
on their own with judging I learned the

516
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,419
automated tools like like

517
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,059
yeah open source ones if you they're

518
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,500
these there are tools that are more

519
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,440
built for doing this against like people

520
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,460
um that are free like maltigo and uh

521
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,919
Spider foot uh you can do organizational

522
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,179
stuff in there too they work for that

523
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,039
but there are also commercial options

524
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,320
which I will not discuss because I'm at

525
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,120
a you know I'm on a B-side stage here I

526
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,860
can only talk about free stuff

527
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,280
but uh yes there are options uh out

528
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
there and I think those are two great

529
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,980
ways to get started but also a lot of

530
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,660
this you can just kind of do you know

531
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,780
from a search engine uh with with enough

532
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,080
time

533
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,340
anything else

534
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,559
all right well uh that's it thanks

535
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,760

536
