1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
foreign

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:21,500
[Music]

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,180
hi everyone I have four o'clock so I'll

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,100
go ahead and get started

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,820
um

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,340
so hi I'm Nikki Robinson thank you

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,800
everyone for coming today I'm going to

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,899
be talking about complexity and

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,700
specifically complexity when it comes to

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,160
security tooling so let's get started

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,219
oh maybe

12
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,340
there we go uh so first up all thoughts

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,899
feelings beliefs are my own they do not

14
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,460
reflect my employers

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,579
now that that's out of the way

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,000
so uh by day I'm a security architect at

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,940
IBM I worked on the ciso remediation

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,940
team so I do everything from incident

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,199
response vulnerability management

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,600
everything in between

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,939
um I'm also a professor of practice at

22
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,340
Capital technology University so I teach

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,880
research and design so I'm also an icit

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
fellow for this year 2022 to 2023

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,939
I also recently wrote a book called Mind

26
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,520
the tech gap which was really fun and

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,000
some of that uh it's the blend of I.T

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,340
cyber security and human factors which

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,680
uh shock I'll give you like a little

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,939
preview I'm going to be talking about

31
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,259
today

32
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,479
um I also co-host the Brazilian cyber

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,520
podcast uh with my good friend Chris

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,920
Hughes on LinkedIn live

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,259
I have a DSC in cyber security and PhD

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,900
in human factors and one of the reasons

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,900
why this topic I've really wanted to

38
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,299
talk about for a long time is because of

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,100
my research in human factors and in

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,439
Psychology so

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,740
that research really led me heavily into

42
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,240
lots of different areas in cyber

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,299
security very specifically how quickly

44
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,280
things get complex and and how difficult

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,079
it can be to manage environments so

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,340
so I wouldn't be a good researcher if I

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,540
didn't start with my problem statement

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,099
so I'll start there

49
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,200
but then I want to talk about how really

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,819
how we got here how did we get to this

51
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,120
place of complexity in our security

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,879
tooling environments and

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,280
not just security tooling but it's sort

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
of cyber security programs in general

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,700
there's a lot of complexity when it

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,819
comes to our programs whether you're on

57
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,319
a small cyber security team whether

58
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,879
you're an I.T professional that's also

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,640
the cyber security team or or working in

60
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,379
a large organization

61
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,879
uh then I'm going to talk a little bit

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,920
about what that means in regards to

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,200
human factors and then hopefully

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,660
providing some good feedback some good

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,580
things to take back either to your own

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,200
organizations or your own teams or your

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
own tools uh to try to see if you have

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,340
some complexity in your environment and

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,019
maybe see if you can reduce some of that

70
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,900
and improve efficiency of some of the

71
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,160
security tools that you might have in

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,080
your own environments and then I'm going

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,200
to introduce a cyber security tooling

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,260
and maturity model sort of especially

75
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,480
for smaller to medium-sized businesses

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,580
where it can be really difficult to try

77
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,019
to determine what do you even need in

78
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,099
your environment what do you need to

79
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,720
sort of go forward and make sure you're

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,879
getting the right picture so I'll

81
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,018
introduce that near the end

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,140
okay so why are cyber security

83
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,780
environments so complex and why tooling

84
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,599
specifically is so complex it's really

85
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,640
no secret a lot of environments are

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
moving to cloud or using hybrid Cloud

87
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
environments they might be using you

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
know AWS and Azure or AWS and gcp as

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,900
well as managing on-premise systems too

90
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,500
they may still have pii or IP that they

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,799
want to keep on premise or or specific

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,940
environments Legacy environments maybe

93
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,760
they're not ready to move to the cloud

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,580
so that problem statement alone of

95
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,680
having Cloud environments and

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,299
integrating that into your organization

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,760
starts to add complexity that that's

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,260
where that picture sort of starts

99
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,879
because

100
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,519
when you're managing one environment

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,900
it's pretty easy to sort of say okay

102
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,459
this is what I've got

103
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,918
I I think I know what I need let me go

104
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,779
from there but once you're managing

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,820
multiple environments simultaneously

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,040
especially if you're a small team if

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,540
you're a developer with complex

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,720
development environments it becomes

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,340
really difficult to start to get that

110
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,160
picture of what you actually have and

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,199
then what do you need and then it starts

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
to be okay well do we also need this

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,979
tool do we also need that am I actually

114
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,600
seeing all the vulnerabilities in my

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,060
environment am I not so those questions

116
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,979
start to come up and that's when new

117
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,680
tools come into play or you know hey

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,660
let's rip and replace let's rip out a

119
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,940
tool and put a new one in place that

120
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,660
that may or may not solve the problem

121
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,400
uh I.T and cyber Security Professionals

122
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
overwhelmed

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,000
um I think especially as a security

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
practitioner I can say this for from my

125
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,139
vantage point too there's a lot we have

126
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,940
to look at and not just a lot we have to

127
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,919
know right there's certifications in

128
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,340
education but when it comes to security

129
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,800
tooling the things that we need to do

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,860
our jobs whether you're in a sock or

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,120
you're doing incident response or

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,460
digital forensics chances are you're

133
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,039
using I would say maybe five tools

134
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,120
minimum

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
probably a lot more than that and it's

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,039
also possible that there are other tools

137
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,720
in the environment that maybe other team

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
members are leveraging for the same

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,240
thing

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
but they're seeing a different picture

141
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
than you so they might be leveraging

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,639
other tools seeing a different picture

143
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,199
but you have to come together and figure

144
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,639
out wait did you find this vulnerability

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,520
did you find this so security tool

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,880
sprawl becomes not just a problem for

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,919
managing the environment because you

148
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,020
have to do upkeep on those tools but it

149
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,639
also can potentially increase the attack

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,860
surface too all of these tools need

151
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,680
access to other things so not only do

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
you have this connectivity between

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
devices in Cloud environments but then

154
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,740
if you're providing administrative

155
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,560
access or opening ports or you know

156
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,120
providing additional access to these

157
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,400
security tools that are containing all

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,479
this information uh solarwinds anyone

159
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,180
it becomes this big pile of information

160
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,720
that if compromised could be pretty

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,319
detrimental to the environment too

162
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,380
and then I just wanted to hit on a

163
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
couple of buzzwords digital

164
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,800
transformation and zero trust you know

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
there's zero trust tools now there

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,100
there's there's tools for lots of

167
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,020
different reasons and it's not to say

168
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,280
that one tool will fix everything

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,100
because I think now we need lots of

170
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,840
tools to do our jobs we need lots of

171
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,940
tools to see the entire environment

172
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,440
I'm going to get into that in a second

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,259
uh complexity and depth so I wanted to

174
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,360
take that down a level just from

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,600
multi-cloud environments to

176
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,840
anyone that's managing Legacy systems

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,660
and new systems or had to potentially

178
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,819
even pull Legacy applications or Legacy

179
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,539
OS into Cloud environments and are

180
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,740
probably in transition to using newer or

181
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,080
supported OS and application levels so

182
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,639
now not only are you managing multiple

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,199
Cloud environments or potentially a

184
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,240
cloud environment in on-prem but you may

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
also be

186
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,919
supporting multiple OS levels multiple

187
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,020
application levels that adds to that

188
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,220
complexity it takes you down another

189
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,560
level of oh we're not just supporting or

190
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,780
looking at vulnerabilities for for all

191
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,880
seven anymore we're looking for rel7 and

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
rail 8. I need to make sure my patch my

193
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,620
patch management tools I need to make

194
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,580
sure my vulnerability management

195
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,740
scanning that I'm seeing vulnerabilities

196
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,900
for both but now instead of having eyes

197
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,960
on one maybe one OS level I have to have

198
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
it on two three four five different

199
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
levels

200
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,319
a complex development environments if

201
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,419
you have anyone that's running a

202
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,639
development environment you probably

203
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,740
have prod Dev and test you may have

204
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,120
other environments too you might have a

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,060
Sandbox you might have other areas that

206
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,560
are specific for you know different

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
types of applications and so those

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
amount of environments continue to grow

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,039
so when we're talking about security

210
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,560
tooling not only do we need a window

211
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,319
into those systems but we need to then

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,599
parse that information and see it at

213
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,900
lots of different application OS and

214
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,539
other levels too so it becomes

215
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,899
really complex really quickly

216
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,240
and then looking at user accounts versus

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
business accounts you know did someone

218
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,000
open maybe a cloud account on their own

219
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,140
uh for the business maybe they're

220
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,520
running some sort of environment in

221
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,779
there but then there's also business

222
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:46,980
accounts that they're using for other

223
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,779
things so now you've got lots of cloud

224
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,220
accounts that you're managing across

225
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,560
lots of different areas that you need to

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,060
have visibility into and you may or may

227
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,239
not

228
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,160
so this migration uh when we're talking

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
about digital transformation it's not

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,399
really just digital transformation it's

231
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,100
really we're changing the way that we

232
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,260
manage environments you know it's not

233
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,000
like we just need a vulnerability

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,060
scanner and maybe antivirus or EDR we

235
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,560
need a lot of different tools now we

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,300
need um which I'll get into in a second

237
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,720
but talking about sassed dast

238
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,160
um we're talking about pipelines now

239
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,620
cicd pipelines there's a lot of

240
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,839
additional components and things that we

241
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,880
need to be able to see logging logging

242
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,500
is still a problem because now we have

243
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,540
all this data but how do you parse it do

244
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,920
you need to get another tool to be able

245
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,839
to actually parse this information that

246
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,060
you have so

247
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,279
that's where the the problem started to

248
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,160
happen we saw a need for new types of

249
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,140
tools different types of tools

250
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,420
to help give us a better picture into

251
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,279
our environments because we need that

252
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,019
data we need to see what's going on and

253
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,640
if we can't get into these multiple

254
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,899
environments it makes more difficult

255
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,420
hence another tool or another tool you

256
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,640
know if you have AWS and Azure you may

257
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,560
need to have separate security tools or

258
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,860
separate security tool

259
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,300
solutions for each environment that

260
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,440
might play in their own cloud

261
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
environment but that means two sets of

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
cloud Security toolings Solutions that

263
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,060
you're managing at the same time

264
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,580
uh the needs of business are changing so

265
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,380
quickly I mean we've all seen how

266
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,500
quickly development is taking over a lot

267
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,940
of what we do

268
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,860
there are a lot more devops and

269
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,500
devsecops environments the way that we

270
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,560
managed Legacy I.T infrastructure is

271
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,899
very different from how we do it now and

272
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,580
some of that means that the original

273
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,800
security tooling that we had in place is

274
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,360
a good start but now we have to

275
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,920
integrate other tools probably open

276
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,320
source tools other things to help give

277
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,640
us that picture

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,920
and then I highlighted Shadow I.T and

279
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,540
Legacy systems because I think those are

280
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,820
the bane of all cyber security problems

281
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,740
but but especially when it comes to

282
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,779
security tooling it becomes really

283
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,760
difficult when you're trying to

284
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,920
focus on what tools do I need to see in

285
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,500
these new environments these new

286
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,360
application and Dev environments versus

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,420
how am I still looking at you know I

288
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,720
hope not but a server 2008 or 2013 or

289
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,060
how or 2012 how am I actually seeing am

290
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,560
I actually seeing vulnerabilities on

291
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
these systems and do I need to continue

292
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,160
looking at them while I'm also trying to

293
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,600
figure out how to manage infrastructure

294
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,180
as code so it's very two different two

295
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,800
different sets of problems that we're

296
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,940
trying to solve with lots of different

297
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,420
tools

298
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,120
so I wanted to

299
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,579
take it back up a level because security

300
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,079
tooling can mean lots of different

301
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,160
things

302
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,560
um it could be everything from you know

303
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,540
looking at a vulnerability scanner to

304
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,899
what do I need to look at for IAM how do

305
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,880
I look at my different policies for user

306
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,380
accounts because those are

307
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,300
vulnerabilities too if I don't have any

308
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,040
sort of lease privilege in place or how

309
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,600
do I actually get a picture into what's

310
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,980
going on with my accounts and account

311
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,839
management

312
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,680
so managing current infrastructure while

313
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,760
also trying to tune and manage tools for

314
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,339
current threats current iocs indicators

315
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,160
a compromise trying to look at specific

316
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,440
threats or specific iocs for your own

317
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,140
business or your own domain it can be

318
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,060
really difficult to manage that current

319
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,040
security tooling infrastructure while

320
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,140
also trying to constantly tune looking

321
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,480
at alerts tune alert student alerts so

322
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,420
it just becomes increasingly difficult

323
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,760
to manage

324
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,339
the other is the I wanted to bring up

325
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,399
because when a business is evaluating

326
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,459
security tools The Business Leaders may

327
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,140
be looking at security tools for a

328
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,640
different reason they might be looking

329
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,380
at it for what kind of reporting

330
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
capability does it give me what kind of

331
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,760
visibility can I see quickly yeah what

332
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,139
kind of Graphics can I see what kind of

333
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,300
reports can I get versus you know

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,800
security tools that we might use as

335
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,019
practitioners to help us get a better

336
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,660
picture of what's actually going on and

337
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,459
we need a different view than a business

338
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,680
leader would so how do we get the right

339
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,540
tools to help make sure that our

340
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,579
Business Leaders Executives and

341
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,480
directors are getting the right

342
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,339
information they need while also giving

343
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,519
us practitioners the right information

344
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,500
to be able to remediate vulnerabilities

345
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,920
to find them and hopefully hone that

346
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,959
information going forward

347
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,880
and then integrating threat intelligence

348
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,579
you know that that's a big

349
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,860
um it's a big step for a lot of small

350
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,779
organizations to integrate threat

351
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,180
intelligence but it's becoming more and

352
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,920
more important to integrate those types

353
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,440
of tools that type of Intel maybe even a

354
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,720
program into an organization so that

355
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,279
you're getting more context into your

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,320
own environment instead of saying okay

357
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,959
I've got you know 10 000 vulnerabilities

358
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,000
what do I do with them what's most

359
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,339
important how do I prioritize and that's

360
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,920
really the most important piece of this

361
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,779
is that how do I get the right

362
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,399
information so that I can prioritize

363
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
because there are so many

364
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
vulnerabilities released every day

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
whether there have scores or not whether

366
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
they have patches available or

367
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,000
configurations available to actually

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,519
remediate them but that adds another

369
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,560
additional layer of complexity that I'll

370
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,740
be getting to in a second too but it

371
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,800
adds to that picture of okay I need to

372
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,420
see all these vulnerabilities but now

373
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,279
that I have all this data how do I

374
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,600
prioritize it what am I going to do with

375
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
it

376
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,560
which takes me to a vulnerability

377
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,139
scoring so uh I did both my DSC and PhD

378
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,940
around vulnerability training and

379
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,100
vulnerability scoring mostly because I

380
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,660
think it's a really interesting topic

381
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,360
but also because

382
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,300
vulnerability management can be a really

383
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,079
complex topic and for a lot of I.T teams

384
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,940
or development teams you don't have a

385
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,459
ton of time to sit and worry about what

386
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,980
does a nine versus a 10 mean and what do

387
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,500
I fix first you know if I have 5 000

388
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,940
critical vulnerabilities what does that

389
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,680
mean to me you know I can't remediate

390
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,300
them all what do I do first

391
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,760
so that's one of the reasons why I think

392
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,500
this is a good one to sort of dive deep

393
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,019
on because this is just one area of

394
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,000
security tooling and really one area of

395
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,519
one type of security tool to sort of

396
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
highlight how complex this can get when

397
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,300
you start to dig into what does this

398
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,519
information actually mean when I'm

399
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,199
getting so much information from so many

400
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,940
different tool sets

401
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,399
so we have now for vulnerability scoring

402
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,959
which is great by the way we have a lot

403
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,940
of information uh it's great you know we

404
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,699
have CVSs is is a place to start it

405
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,339
gives us an initial score but it is it

406
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,740
doesn't provide a lot of context it

407
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,560
gives us a sort of a baseline but like I

408
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,820
said when you're in an environment you

409
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,399
have 10 000 critical vulnerabilities you

410
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,199
know where do you start

411
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
now we have the exploit prediction

412
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,180
scoring system or epss which again is

413
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,519
great it's another enhanced uh ability

414
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,000
gives us an enhanced way to look at is

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
okay a vulnerability is a critical or a

416
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,620
medium or low is it exploitable if it's

417
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,500
exploitable okay should I remediate that

418
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,079
first probably if it's externally facing

419
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,880
should I fix that first yeah probably

420
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
but that helps give you that picture

421
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,720
then to sort of Whittle down just from a

422
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,279
CVSs score

423
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,220
but now we also have the Kev another

424
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,519
great tool available to us known

425
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,339
exploited vulnerabilities now we have a

426
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,959
really great open source library of

427
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,000
known exploited vulnerabilities that's

428
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,740
awesome now I can take this information

429
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,899
add even more context into how I

430
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,639
prioritize vulnerability management and

431
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,380
Remediation

432
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,180
but depending on the tooling that you're

433
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,139
using

434
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,079
there are other great product tools that

435
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,240
provide scoring or maybe enhanced

436
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,760
context like the tenable VPR the

437
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
vulnerability priority rating

438
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,660
which again is like a heat map and it

439
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,759
helps show you where you probably want

440
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
to focus your remediation efforts

441
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,220
but now we've got heat Maps we've got

442
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,259
lots of different scores we've got open

443
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,940
source libraries that we need to look at

444
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,880
to see if this information is applicable

445
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,040
um and then we need to have the context

446
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,779
of our own environments where we're

447
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,279
probably managing multiple patch level

448
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,380
system multiple patch levels we probably

449
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,940
have risks that we've accepted for

450
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,160
certain things certain ports have to be

451
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,299
open okay

452
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,040
but now I've got externally facing

453
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,959
versus internal systems

454
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,359
now I've got pii or Phi if you're in the

455
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,880
healthcare industry

456
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,579
and items that can't be remediated so

457
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,740
all of those layers all of those

458
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,020
individual pieces start to stack up into

459
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,299
building this picture and it's literally

460
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,919
just to ask the question should I

461
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,419
remediate this first

462
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,980
that's it there's nothing to do with

463
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,179
threat intelligence or anything like

464
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,700
that and and so once you start adding

465
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,039
all these other security tooling EDR and

466
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,360
all these other components into that

467
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,280
picture it becomes a lot of information

468
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,500
really quickly

469
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,020
um and I know that once you're managing

470
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,080
10 15 different tools it sort of becomes

471
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,760
okay I've got vulnerabilities in 10

472
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,260
different dashboards

473
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,120
am I getting the right information is

474
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,799
this one is this tool showing me

475
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,539
something that this tool isn't

476
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,820
um so it can it can become really

477
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,780
confusing really quickly

478
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,640
so I wanted to give just sort of a

479
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
glimpse of security tooling landscape

480
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,580
this is by no means a complete picture

481
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,559
because it's changing all the time and

482
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,059
we need to see different information all

483
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,340
the time especially as I think

484
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,020
development environments continue to get

485
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,140
more complex and more mature we're using

486
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,419
lots of different types of of tools and

487
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,539
and ways of building code like

488
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,640
um without infrastructure or without as

489
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,960
much infrastructure having to manage

490
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,520
operating systems things like that that

491
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,640
will hopefully help at least some of the

492
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,720
infrastructure management component when

493
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,240
it comes to vulnerability management

494
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
but when we're looking at security tools

495
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,980
and starting to look at security tool

496
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,160
sprawl it starts to become this okay I

497
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,660
need EDR because I need active

498
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,480
monitoring but maybe I'm not convinced

499
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,100
that I'm getting a full picture from

500
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,220
this EDR tool I want to also add some

501
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,919
specific type of malware analysis or

502
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,960
detection or I want to look for

503
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,960
something else specifically you know I

504
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,480
used to use Malwarebytes in combination

505
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
with other things so it's not unusual to

506
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,520
have one or two different solutions just

507
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,120
for one of these areas logging

508
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,280
any complex environment or any

509
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,360
environment where you have multiple

510
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
administrators or multiple developers

511
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,260
hopefully you have logging coming to one

512
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,240
place but it's also possible that you

513
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,440
could have logging going to a couple

514
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,820
different places you might have a couple

515
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,100
different solutions for logging tools

516
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,419
hopefully not because that would be

517
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,179
really complex but it certainly happens

518
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,620
and then when we start to add in the

519
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,380
picture of asset management

520
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,059
configuration management risk management

521
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,160
how are you actually managing if you

522
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
have open risks or you know you have

523
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
items that you can't remediate are you

524
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,860
storing them somewhere are you saving

525
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,840
them in a database or are you keeping

526
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,360
them in a list somewhere and then when

527
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,120
you're adding in incident response

528
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
forensics if you have a small team if

529
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,299
you have a big team and they're doing

530
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,860
their own forensics work you probably

531
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,660
won't have to worry as much about the

532
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,340
you know the sort of forensic tool

533
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,380
landscape but if you have smaller teams

534
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,600
where you have to have all these tools

535
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
in one environment it can become really

536
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,140
difficult to manage them all at the same

537
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,760
time and not just the amount of

538
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,440
information that's coming in but

539
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,780
something as simple as oh did I update

540
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,880
that am I using the latest version of in

541
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
case or is my attenable Nessa scanner up

542
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,700
to date so it's not just the actual

543
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,020
seeing the data that you're getting and

544
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,000
configuring the information to get the

545
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,500
right picture but it's also the

546
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,940
management and infrastructure of those

547
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,360
tools

548
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,039
okay so I'm gonna hop out a technical

549
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,679
for a second and hop into human factors

550
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,179
and some of the psychological things

551
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,220
that I think are just as important about

552
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,960
talking about the technical complexities

553
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,900
of security tooling

554
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,580
when you're managing

555
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,780
10 15 20 different security tools

556
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,840
I start to think about mental workloads

557
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,700
not just managing the infrastructure

558
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,500
managing the data you're probably

559
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,840
reporting on that data and you're

560
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,700
probably making decisions about that

561
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,500
data so

562
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,900
that might be just one piece of your job

563
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,000
too so if you're like me if you're like

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,380
a security architect or if you're a

565
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,059
security engineer and you're managing

566
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,679
lots of different tools you're probably

567
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,419
not just doing that you might be doing

568
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,520
incident response you might be looking

569
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,200
at sock alerts or working with the sock

570
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,940
if something happens as like an

571
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,039
escalation point you might be working

572
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,020
with management providing reporting and

573
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,360
data so you have to be able to ingest

574
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
all this information and be able to pull

575
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,039
it out to the right people and giving

576
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,559
them the right context

577
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,080
that is a lot of information to take in

578
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,520
and to make actionable decisions on

579
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,320
um and I would say security people are

580
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,020
really great at doing that but it's also

581
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,760
I think one of the reasons why we see a

582
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,539
lot of burnout in socks and you know in

583
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,940
cyber security in general we have a ton

584
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,440
of information we have to take in all

585
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,840
the time make decisions and get it right

586
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,820
we can't get it wrong in cyber security

587
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,320
because if we get it wrong we might miss

588
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
something an incident could happen you

589
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,580
know something could go wrong so it's

590
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,720
really important that when we get that

591
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,780
information that we act on it properly

592
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,179
context switching this is one of those

593
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,980
things that I know we do we do this all

594
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,419
the time outside of cyber security right

595
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,520
you go from one app to another you go

596
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,260
from one tool to another you're looking

597
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,480
at maybe let's say you're looking at EDR

598
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
and you're looking at different types of

599
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,000
alerts and things like that and you're

600
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,100
like oh let me see that vulnerability

601
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,720
report was coming in that should be done

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,220
uh right now let me go look at that and

603
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,240
then you go look at the vulnerability

604
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,320
report and then you're looking at email

605
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,659
and then you're looking at slack and

606
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,000
um then you look at Facebook I mean you

607
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,919
know how do you have the time

608
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,320
um but context switching essentially

609
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,419
means that you could be missing things

610
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,980
right I could be missing a really

611
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,600
important Facebook post if I'm

612
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,220
constantly looking at EDR all the time

613
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,020
no no but

614
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,419
um but it can be a lot when you're

615
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,700
context switching to potentially miss

616
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,659
something

617
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,280
and if you're missing something that

618
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,580
could be uh could be like an alert in

619
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,179
EDR that could be malware or or maybe

620
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,620
um you know you're not quite sure but I

621
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,940
don't really have time because I also

622
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,620
have this report that's due at 3 pm and

623
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,240
I have to send that in

624
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,980
um it could be missing something that

625
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,380
could then turn into an incident so

626
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,260
um it's really important to for us when

627
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,880
we're context switching to to not miss

628
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,340
something and and uh it's more about I

629
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,320
think awareness of what context

630
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,200
switching can mean and how difficult it

631
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,460
can be when we're doing this all the

632
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,559
time

633
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,360
metacognition this is my favorite

634
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,299
psychology word uh I love this concept

635
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,700
too because

636
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,200
metacognition is how we think about

637
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,080
thinking it's really just meta

638
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,059
um but how do we think about thinking

639
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,880
how do we make decisions if I made a

640
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,740
decision how do I go back and look at

641
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,600
that decision and determine that I made

642
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,460
the right decision how do I determine

643
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,080
that I had the right information at the

644
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,179
right time if I've got 15 different

645
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,919
security tools

646
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,780
I probably have the right information

647
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,799
but did I have time or the right rule

648
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,419
sets or the right configuration in place

649
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,039
to be able to get the right information

650
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,159
to make that right decision and if I

651
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,659
make a wrong decision can I go back and

652
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,820
look at that and say hmm do I need to

653
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,820
tune this security tool to help me get

654
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,039
the right picture next time

655
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,500
um so metacognition again it's one of

656
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,360
those things I think it's important for

657
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,880
us as security practitioners to get time

658
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,700
to be able to go back and say do I have

659
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,020
the right picture

660
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,640
did I make the right decision there

661
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
based on the information I had at the

662
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
time or could I have made a better

663
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,940
decision if I had tuned this tool in a

664
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,520
different way so so thinking about it

665
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,659
that way

666
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,700
uh perception I'm going to talk about

667
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,840
this again you'll probably hear me say

668
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,860
this like four times but perception my

669
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,360
perception is that this tool doesn't

670
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
work we need to get rid of it it's it's

671
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,340
not working and so we're gonna rip and

672
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,480
replace

673
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
ripping and replace tooling means

674
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
especially for the people that are doing

675
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,059
it not only do you have to completely

676
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,100
decommission any systems that were

677
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,780
managing that or supporting that if you

678
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,100
had vulnerability scanners you've got to

679
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,659
pull all that out now you've got to

680
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,580
bring in an entirely new tool set up a

681
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,220
brand new infrastructure and configure

682
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,760
it all of that configuration time adds

683
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,260
again additional time additional

684
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,520
complexity you could be missing

685
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
something because you're also trying to

686
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,640
decom the old systems and bring new

687
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,159
systems online because in the time that

688
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,840
you're ripping and replacing you could

689
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,700
be missing data and you might have to do

690
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,960
both at the same time you might have to

691
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,059
manage both tools at the same time while

692
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,740
you're bringing the new one online again

693
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,320
that adds to complexity and time spent

694
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,200
on One Security tool problem versus

695
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,880
maybe the security tool landscape where

696
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,600
you've got 10 or 15. so perception my

697
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,039
perception is that this tool doesn't

698
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,760
work is that reality is that really true

699
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,480
or is it that we haven't had time to

700
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,220
properly configure this tool because

701
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,960
we've got 50 other tools that we're

702
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,360
managing and I haven't had time to to

703
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,039
configure this tool in the depth that it

704
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,840
could you know I think of things like

705
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,940
Splunk

706
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,340
um that tool can take a ton of time to

707
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,740
for configuring uh rules for configuring

708
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,080
alerting but it works really well and it

709
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,120
can work really well and there's lots of

710
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,340
tools like that that when you can spend

711
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,539
the time to really configure them

712
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,860
properly they can work really really

713
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,240
well

714
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,820
um but a lot of times we don't have the

715
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,039
time to sit down and configure a tool to

716
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,640
even 50 or 60 of what it could possibly

717
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,760
do uh so we're into we end up not with

718
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,860
the full picture we could have and then

719
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,360
you know maybe to management or

720
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,100
executive management it looks like well

721
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,000
but we're not getting the right

722
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,320
information or I'm not getting enough

723
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,960
information this tool isn't working and

724
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,580
maybe that's just perception maybe it's

725
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,120
reality but maybe it's just perception

726
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,460
it versus business versus cyber security

727
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,320
so this is the whole reason I wrote the

728
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
book because

729
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,400
um we all need a different picture we

730
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,720
all need to see something a little bit

731
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,360
different to provide context we all have

732
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,520
different goals you know I.T or

733
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,400
development they might have slas they

734
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,380
may have if they're working in agile

735
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,179
maybe they have two week Sprints that

736
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,980
they're really worried about in cyber

737
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,020
security we're worried about the next

738
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,880
ioc or the next exploitable

739
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,159
vulnerability and how that may impact

740
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,260
those teams and so sometimes those are

741
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,320
really competing goals and it can add to

742
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,380
the attention or misconception about how

743
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,179
the security tooling is working or what

744
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,700
we need to see everyone might need a

745
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,380
different picture but again sometimes

746
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,360
that comes down to tuning it could come

747
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,559
down to

748
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,659
how is this tool actually configured to

749
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,100
report the information to the right

750
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,220
person you know am I sending a 300 page

751
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,100
vulnerability report to a developer and

752
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,320
asking them to just fix it all you know

753
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
that's probably not a good solution

754
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,940
um so how can we tune and potentially

755
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,039
fix some of these things to make that

756
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,080
picture better for the actual audience

757
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,580
the people that are actually consuming

758
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,559
the information and again that just

759
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,059
takes additional configuration time

760
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,039
sometimes time we don't have

761
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,679
alert fatigue you know this is one of

762
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,539
those things that has been studied

763
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,419
really heavily especially with socks

764
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,760
um because and not the socks that you

765
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
wear

766
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,000
um but for socs

767
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,860
um still one of I love that acronym

768
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,240
anyway

769
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
um so socks that that is their job sock

770
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
analysts they're constantly consuming

771
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,260
information looking at alerts Network

772
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,640
traffic

773
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,340
um EDR alerts or or is this malware did

774
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,960
someone get fished was a file downloaded

775
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,179
to someone exfiltrate data did someone

776
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,919
they're constantly looking at all these

777
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,440
different streams of data

778
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,380
um when you see alerts all the time you

779
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,539
start to think that's is that really an

780
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,700
alert should I really be is that really

781
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,159
anomalous it's probably not that bad

782
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,539
um especially when you see you know 99

783
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,220
of the time the traffic that you're

784
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,440
seeing is probably okay you might miss

785
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,059
that one percent because it's like oh my

786
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,260
God I'm looking at alerts all the time

787
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,900
all the time uh there was a study

788
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,179
there was a study done on alert fatigue

789
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,600
and it was on essentially how long a

790
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
sock analyst could

791
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,700
look at a screen and get the actual

792
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,320
context from the alerts that were coming

793
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,360
through and I think the cap was at like

794
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,400
15 or 20 minutes of the amount of time

795
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,900
that you could actually sit and stare at

796
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,820
the screen and get the right information

797
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,740
out of it and that'll be dependent on

798
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,360
the person right like some some people

799
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,500
might be able to take that information

800
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,260
in for longer some people for Less

801
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,299
um but imagine staring at that screen

802
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,659
for eight hours a day every day for

803
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,100
years

804
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,020
um alert fatigue is a real thing you

805
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,980
know if you're constantly looking at

806
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,480
alerts you may miss something and it's

807
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,740
not you know it's not anyone's fault

808
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,220
it's just how we as humans operate

809
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,899
um which is why job rotation I think is

810
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,580
so important for socks you know not

811
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,200
having them constantly look into alerts

812
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,720
all day provide them uh something else

813
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,340
to do you know six month rotations or

814
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,320
something like that to help give them a

815
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
different picture before they can come

816
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,399
back to to looking at alerts

817
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,039
um and then decision paralysis so this

818
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,299
is one of those things I just started

819
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,179
looking into recently because uh one of

820
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,980
the things we do in cyber security in

821
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,539
general but especially when we're taking

822
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,220
in all these streams of information from

823
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,260
all these different security tools uh we

824
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,700
have to make a decision based on this

825
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,020
information

826
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,539
when we have so much information it can

827
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,520
be difficult to make that decision to

828
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,620
say is this anomalous Behavior or is

829
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,779
this expected because if you say this is

830
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,059
anomalous behavior and you go ahead and

831
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,980
start with an incident and you're wrong

832
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,799
you might be getting executive

833
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,299
management involved or you might be

834
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,100
getting a customer involved in an

835
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,779
incident that you know may or may not be

836
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,880
happening but then the opposite can be a

837
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,039
problem too if you make a decision too

838
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,140
quickly

839
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,940
without the right context you could also

840
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,320
make the wrong decision in the wrong way

841
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,380
so decision paralysis is this sort of oh

842
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,539
my gosh I've got so much information I'm

843
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,740
not sure what the right answer is

844
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,480
because now I'm taking in so much

845
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,760
information it's hard for me to to sort

846
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,620
of make that decision

847
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,159
um

848
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,799
I think the human factors piece or and

849
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,779
the psychological piece really of human

850
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,100
factors

851
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,260
um and human factors for anyone that

852
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,840
just hasn't studied it in depth I see a

853
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,000
lot of research around human factors as

854
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,159
security awareness training

855
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,840
um and and that's one piece of it how do

856
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,179
people learn but the other piece of it

857
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,240
is uh design how do we build tools that

858
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,700
are effective and and help people be

859
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,320
more efficient

860
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,880
um understanding engineering and

861
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,340
psychological practices together so it's

862
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,840
one of those reasons why I think we need

863
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,000
to sort of bring human factors into what

864
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
we do as security practitioners one

865
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,840
because I think it can help make our

866
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
jobs a little bit easier but I think

867
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,380
understanding big problems like security

868
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,200
tool sprawl and complexity even just

869
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,700
being aware of some of these things we

870
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,740
can build them into our programs and add

871
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,620
a job rotation into socks maybe to help

872
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,440
reduce alert fatigue or reduce missing

873
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,779
you know potentially major alerts

874
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,720
okay so to come back out of human

875
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,460
factors a little bit

876
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,179
um I I asked this question because

877
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:58,440
you know when you start to think about

878
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,760
how many tools you have in your own

879
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,980
environment uh

880
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,840
the real question is what do you what do

881
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,580
you need what do you actually need you

882
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,159
know do you have tools in place that you

883
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:08,940
know maybe you're getting information

884
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,980
from but maybe you don't log into that

885
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,419
tool that much maybe you don't really

886
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,039
need it that much or maybe you're sort

887
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,179
of getting the information from

888
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,919
somewhere else

889
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,840
um but you have to have some sort of

890
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,520
vulnerability scanning in place you have

891
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,100
to have something in place to be able to

892
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,399
understand uh what what vulnerabilities

893
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,440
do I have in my environment that might

894
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,899
be multiple tools it I think especially

895
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,100
in very

896
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,740
um in multi-cloud environments or in

897
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,480
again in on-premise and Cloud

898
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
environments you might be able to extend

899
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,740
a tool from on-prem to Cloud uh maybe

900
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,360
not you know it's going to be dependent

901
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,880
on the environment but to really help

902
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,740
with that prioritization piece because

903
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,179
without it it's just a ton of

904
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,460
vulnerability information uh that you're

905
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,840
staring at and trying to figure out how

906
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,539
to how do I fix what do I fix first

907
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,299
endpoint detection and response some way

908
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,919
to contain

909
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,860
a machine some way to contain a an

910
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,159
endpoint that you suspect might be an

911
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,020
issue or have an issue that that's

912
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,399
something that you really need you need

913
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,740
some sort of alerting or capability to

914
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,480
get a good picture of your environment

915
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,640
of sort of what's going on or if

916
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,260
something might be malicious

917
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,539
uh real-time monitoring so that you can

918
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,220
have some type of continuous monitoring

919
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,960
in place so whether that's with a

920
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,880
vulnerability scanning tool you might

921
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,279
have you might have it with EDR some

922
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,779
sort of continuous monitoring and

923
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,880
alerting happening uh you might have to

924
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,380
have another tool for that depending on

925
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,539
what your environment needs are

926
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,159
um and then I should have put asset and

927
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,080
software management at the top because

928
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,120
that really should come before your

929
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,760
vulnerability scanning tool but where

930
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,500
and how are you managing your assets and

931
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,539
your software libraries you know do you

932
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,240
know what you have and and where it is

933
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,179
because without those it it's really

934
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:52,559
difficult to get a good vulnerability

935
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,659
management picture but it's also really

936
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,960
difficult to determine not only what

937
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,820
vulnerabilities do I have but what do I

938
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,480
need to fix first

939
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,080
okay the other thing I wanted to bring

940
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,159
up

941
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,560
that again adds to this sort of big

942
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,619
complexity picture which is open source

943
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,199
versus paid tooling so chances are

944
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,639
you've probably got a mix of both in

945
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,199
your environments there's a lot of

946
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,760
really great open source tools out there

947
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,300
to help if you have one picture with

948
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,099
your sort of maybe your vulnerability

949
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,020
scanner or something like that you might

950
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,599
have another tool in place that might

951
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,219
help give you better context or better

952
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,440
information

953
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,260
um but multi-cloud environments you

954
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,020
might need to have external Tools in

955
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,418
both sets of environments not always

956
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,219
there are plenty of tools that can play

957
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,320
in multi-cloud environments but it's

958
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,940
certainly about maybe finding those

959
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,399
tools instead of managing maybe lots of

960
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,260
tools across multiple Cloud accounts or

961
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,760
across multiple different types of cloud

962
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,820
environments and on-prem

963
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,060
and then open source again it's another

964
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,960
great

965
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,359
potential area to get a better picture

966
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
of your environment but you're also

967
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,380
again potentially increasing that attack

968
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,020
surface depending on what type of

969
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,240
tooling you're using so if you're using

970
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,760
something that isn't being patched or

971
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,920
updated frequently it could be its own

972
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,380
vulnerable uh entity that you're sort of

973
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,119
bringing into the environment too so

974
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,800
it's another one of those you sort of

975
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
have to weigh am I getting better

976
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,339
information from this versus increasing

977
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,920
my attack surface but it's another

978
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,680
essentially component of how do I choose

979
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
the right tools what do I actually need

980
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,400
in my environment and what's worth it

981
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,599
what's worth it to have in the

982
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,280
environment

983
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,339
so I wanted to introduce this this is

984
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,680
um it's pretty basic but hopefully a

985
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,180
good starting place for anyone that's

986
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,700
got you know maybe massive Tools in your

987
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,859
environment or lots of complexity in

988
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,060
your environments

989
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,920
but to think about you know sort of

990
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,720
where you want to start

991
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,240
um and once you've sort of gotten to the

992
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,560
top I'll go through each of these but

993
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
once you've sort of gotten to the top to

994
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
come back down to the bottom and start

995
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,900
to evaluate again you know we do

996
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,300
continuous monitoring for

997
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,280
vulnerabilities for Network traffic and

998
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,920
and alerting why don't we do continuous

999
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,780
monitoring for our security tools you

1000
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,400
know why don't we continuously monitor

1001
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,440
them and see if they're working for us

1002
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,240
if they're making sense for us or if

1003
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
they're configured properly just like

1004
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,099
anything else you know configurations

1005
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,200
can get changed or may need to be

1006
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,820
changed depending on how the environment

1007
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,680
is you know I always use something as

1008
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,260
simple as if you have

1009
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,800
um you know Windows 10 and windows 11

1010
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,780
you may need to change if you have a

1011
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,579
vulnerability scanner in place you might

1012
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,500
have to change your policies to make

1013
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,940
sure that you're accounting for any of

1014
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,160
the changes in Windows 11 versus Windows

1015
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,640
10. Powershell monitoring you know that

1016
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,320
may change depending on what version of

1017
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,579
Powershell that you have in the

1018
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,980
environment so

1019
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,020
again it should be this continuation

1020
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,760
this iterative approach to security

1021
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,920
tooling where you're you're sort of

1022
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,140
asking yourself is this still valuable

1023
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,300
and if it's not valuable why is it

1024
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,500
because I haven't had enough time to

1025
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,420
spend on it or is it because it really

1026
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,980
doesn't meet our business needs anymore

1027
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,660
you know we're moving to multi-cloud

1028
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,040
environments we need a tool that works

1029
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,480
for both this just isn't going to work

1030
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
anymore

1031
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,660
um so it's really just sort of about you

1032
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,280
know asking that question and making

1033
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,040
sure that we do this over time so

1034
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,900
starting with something like EDR right

1035
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,880
that would sort of be the first place

1036
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,960
you want to make sure that you've got

1037
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,280
something on your systems when you bring

1038
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,140
them online and making sure that they're

1039
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,599
being actively monitoring actively

1040
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,640
monitored some sort of vulnerability

1041
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,339
scanning of course and then some sort of

1042
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,020
network monitoring maybe that comes with

1043
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,240
EDR maybe it doesn't maybe you need a

1044
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
separate tool for that

1045
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
um compliance reporting and Frameworks

1046
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,040
I've seen a lot more especially for

1047
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,599
environments that maybe go through

1048
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,099
regular audits maybe they have

1049
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,900
assessments or they're beholden to

1050
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,240
specific regulations they might have to

1051
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,800
have a separate compliance tool or

1052
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,839
framework something in place that

1053
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,339
they're actively monitoring there are

1054
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,780
plenty of vulnerabilities scanning or

1055
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,460
vulnerability tools that come with that

1056
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,780
but again it's just additional

1057
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,359
configuration that will have to go into

1058
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,320
place

1059
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,700
um and then Sasser dast if you have

1060
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,560
complex development environments and

1061
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
again that's not all inclusive there's

1062
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,300
lots of other application testing and

1063
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,980
like I said CI CD pipelines and things

1064
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,740
like that that you have to consider and

1065
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,660
then you know are you getting to a place

1066
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,420
of talking about threat modeling and

1067
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,859
probably using the tools that you have

1068
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,560
in place to use for threat modeling or

1069
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,940
potentially getting threat intelligence

1070
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,800
Tools in your environment to again

1071
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,560
expand the view of the information that

1072
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,540
you have but to also give you context

1073
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,060
for the information that you're getting

1074
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,740
and then hopefully getting to a single

1075
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,460
plane of of glass or something like xdr

1076
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,200
which is extended detection and response

1077
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,420
but hopefully giving you

1078
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,440
some some single mechanism some or maybe

1079
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,060
one or two areas that you look for

1080
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,460
information versus 10 or 15 different

1081
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,720
places that you have to look for

1082
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,280
information so hopefully that's the end

1083
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,900
State you're getting to a place where

1084
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,060
you have this sort of Consolidated

1085
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,920
tooling and monitoring

1086
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,940
um knowing that that's not always

1087
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,619
possible but hopefully that's a good end

1088
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:09,540
state but then always going back through

1089
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,579
that process and saying okay am I

1090
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:12,300
actually seeing the right

1091
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,099
vulnerabilities in the environment am I

1092
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,180
not

1093
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,160
um and and going back through the steps

1094
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,940
okay

1095
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,880
so my last bit here

1096
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,619
um that I'm going to sort of talk about

1097
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,280
recommendations and this is just these

1098
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,839
are questions I ask myself all the time

1099
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,400
too

1100
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,040
um but uh when we're talking about

1101
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,440
complexity and this is complexity both

1102
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,599
from the technical side and from the you

1103
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,420
know people in human perspective too

1104
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,339
take a comprehensive inventory of your

1105
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,680
tooling that's open source and paid

1106
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,000
tooling you know what are you paying for

1107
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,700
how much are you paying for it is it

1108
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,520
working for you but also you know what

1109
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,200
open source tools do you have an

1110
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,300
environment in your environment

1111
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,000
um and I mean you know really talking to

1112
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,560
you know if you're management talking to

1113
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,940
your security people and saying hey what

1114
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,920
are you using like what are you actually

1115
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,900
missing are you missing pieces that

1116
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,160
you're trying to fill the Gap with open

1117
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,200
source tooling are we not providing you

1118
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
the right budget or tooling you know to

1119
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,980
sort of go back and figure out what you

1120
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,300
need

1121
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,460
um you know versus trying to come up

1122
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,900
with Creative Solutions or building

1123
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,420
tools to help give us that picture

1124
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:27,480
um

1125
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,760
so what do you have versus what are you

1126
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,099
missing this can be a this is actually a

1127
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,300
really difficult question to answer

1128
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,380
because you don't know what you don't

1129
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,520
know

1130
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,200
um but I think that's why like

1131
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,760
conferences like this are great or

1132
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,200
actually like talking to vendors and

1133
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,280
seeing what products are out there

1134
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,420
because

1135
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,740
um sometimes just having a conversation

1136
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,240
with someone can give you a better idea

1137
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,619
of oh I didn't know that was a thing let

1138
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,060
me go check that out and see if I can

1139
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,160
use this and maybe it'll give you a

1140
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,099
better picture into your own environment

1141
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,420
vulnerabilities management is one of

1142
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,480
those things that especially in like I

1143
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,800
keep mentioning complex development

1144
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,839
environments but that's because

1145
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,579
vulnerability management is getting more

1146
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,920
complex it's increasingly complex

1147
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,380
because without the right Tools in place

1148
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,619
it might look like an application is

1149
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:11,579
secure

1150
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,440
you might run a tool and it's like oh

1151
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,180
yeah this is fine

1152
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,980
um but it might not be you could run

1153
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,500
another tool and get 150 findings and it

1154
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,660
might be because you didn't have the um

1155
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,220
the right tool for that specific

1156
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,320
application or that specific library to

1157
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,599
actually see those things so

1158
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,400
um so determining okay do I have the

1159
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,260
right tools for the actual application

1160
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,599
infrastructure that I have

1161
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,700
um and then the big question are you

1162
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,500
really missing functionality or are they

1163
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,420
not fully configured I really recommend

1164
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,099
this this is one of those things I do

1165
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,839
all the time where I go back and I look

1166
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,400
at tools and say

1167
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,920
one am I getting the best picture and

1168
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,480
two and like if I'm missing information

1169
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,640
can I do it with this tool is there

1170
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,740
something I'm missing from the

1171
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,320
Management console or from the actual

1172
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,359
visibility it has to different systems

1173
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,119
maybe because my asset inventory isn't

1174
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,800
quite right I'm not getting a good

1175
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,079
picture of what's actually going on the

1176
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,700
to actually determine the risk in my

1177
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,760
environment so I highly recommend taking

1178
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,560
a look at your tools seeing how well

1179
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,900
they're configured and spending some

1180
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,180
time with them

1181
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,900
um and I say skill sets uh because

1182
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,420
something like Splunk I am not an expert

1183
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,640
in Splunk by any means that is something

1184
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,920
I would need to take time to really

1185
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,660
really learn I understand basic rule

1186
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,520
sets things like that but I think to

1187
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,079
configure a really complex tool like

1188
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,180
that I would need training I would need

1189
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,000
to go and spend a week and really dive

1190
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,740
deep into it to understand how it would

1191
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,160
best serve me and my environment so

1192
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,380
um taking that back to to the teams you

1193
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,060
know do the teams have you know if

1194
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,079
you're using like a vulnerability

1195
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,540
scanner do they really know how to

1196
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,760
configure it or did they sort of inherit

1197
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,500
it and they're managing it you know

1198
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,119
configuration and operations and

1199
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,260
management are sort of two different

1200
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,960
things so if you're handed a tool you're

1201
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,819
not quite sure how to manage it it could

1202
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:01,800
be worth it to go take that upscaling

1203
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,839
and say I'm not quite sure I need to go

1204
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,280
figure out how this tool really works

1205
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,900
how it's actually configured because

1206
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,780
that might give a again another clue as

1207
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,980
to

1208
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,720
um why it's configured that way

1209
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,520
maybe I'm missing something and maybe

1210
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,720
how to configure it properly

1211
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,900
um and then for practitioners uh I think

1212
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,819
having really good conversations with

1213
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,880
management about saying you know this is

1214
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,859
what we have right now this is what I'm

1215
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:31,619
able to provide to you as you know an

1216
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,540
architect and engineer this is what we

1217
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,760
have I can't give you this information

1218
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
or I can't prioritize vulnerabilities

1219
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,079
because I don't have this this is

1220
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,819
something I need to be able if you want

1221
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,680
a better picture or

1222
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,700
um you know you want to see

1223
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,800
vulnerabilities in any sort of

1224
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,839
prioritized way not just criticals and

1225
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,680
highs to help open that picture up and

1226
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,819
the same for management you know I

1227
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,260
encourage management to actually go talk

1228
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,720
to their practitioners and say

1229
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,040
um okay this is the information you're

1230
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,839
giving me is this everything is this

1231
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,819
really what we need do I need more

1232
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,400
information am I missing something here

1233
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,980
um I I think those conversations help to

1234
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,140
alleviate some of the perception that I

1235
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,599
was talking about before

1236
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,619
perception can be one of those things

1237
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,980
that especially when it comes to secure

1238
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,960
tooling or choosing the right tool or

1239
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,800
not

1240
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,560
I think it can be really challenging to

1241
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,180
make sure that you know management

1242
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,460
understands that there might be things

1243
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,859
under the covers of the actual tool that

1244
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,180
they don't get to see because they just

1245
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,500
see a report or they just see a

1246
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,119
dashboard they don't get to actually see

1247
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,099
all the configuration and time that goes

1248
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,660
in to make sure that that tool gives the

1249
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,339
right information so

1250
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,220
um so I encourage those sort of

1251
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,119
iterative approaches to those

1252
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,740
conversations because the information

1253
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,180
you need is going to change over time

1254
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,000
too it'll probably change day to day but

1255
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,740
hopefully at least starting those

1256
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,960
conversations can help to give at least

1257
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,460
a picture of okay this is what we really

1258
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
have this is what we don't have

1259
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,319
and this is what we need versus this is

1260
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,819
nice to have

1261
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,140
um you know and hopefully that again

1262
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,660
will help to bring that understanding

1263
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,480
back to from management to practitioners

1264
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,280
on you know I know I can't have

1265
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,319
everything but if you really want

1266
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,900
everything this is really what we need

1267
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,540
to give that idea

1268
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,819
um so I wanted to

1269
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,020
um I really wanted to leave plenty of

1270
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,540
time for for questions

1271
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,200
um so that's really my presentation on

1272
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,819
complexity and security tooling and

1273
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,980
happy to answer any questions that

1274
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,700
anyone might have

1275
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,339
thank you I think Dusty oh

1276
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,940
oh hi

1277
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,080
[Music]

1278
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,020
that's coming down

1279
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,740
steps to say here's how

1280
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,579
yes totally um thank you for that yes

1281
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,099
that is totally one of the reasons why I

1282
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,980
wrote the book because uh conversations

1283
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,140
between developers and security or it

1284
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,880
and security I can say this because I

1285
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,680
was I.T operations for about 11 years

1286
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,839
before I got into security so I've had

1287
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,339
those conversations from both sides of

1288
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,079
the fence and I know that they can be

1289
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:39,240
challenging or that there can be tension

1290
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,280
and friction between teams mostly

1291
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,900
because you have competing goals you

1292
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,240
know a developer is worried about their

1293
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,920
two Sprint two week Sprint cycle or

1294
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,359
they're worried about you know hey I

1295
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,400
have to deliver this on this date and

1296
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,520
you know maybe my bonus or my pay is

1297
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,800
dependent on this or my job maybe I'm

1298
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,119
worried about my job if I can't deliver

1299
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,220
this this that's I'm worried about job

1300
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,359
security

1301
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,880
and so as security practitioners I think

1302
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,260
that's one of our jobs when we're

1303
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,020
working with developers or or it in any

1304
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,020
capacity is to lead with empathy that's

1305
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,520
always one of the things another piece

1306
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,980
of that psychological component but to

1307
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,540
listen to what's actually going on with

1308
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,040
them and so when we provide a

1309
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,319
vulnerability report to not provide them

1310
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,000
that 300 Page report I like to start

1311
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,099
with the top five that's that's usually

1312
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,660
my recommendation is start with the top

1313
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,819
five and say Here's the five things we

1314
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,020
have to fix

1315
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,660
in the next two sprints this is what we

1316
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,040
have to do now because if you overload

1317
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,780
them with vulnerabilities it's sort of

1318
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,460
like what what am I going to do with

1319
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,660
this you know I don't have time for this

1320
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,579
this is going to slow me down it's going

1321
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,500
to break my product

1322
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,819
um all these things and so I think if

1323
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:43,380
you can open that conversation with hey

1324
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,720
here's the report but here's the top

1325
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,099
five things we need to do and I'm going

1326
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,780
to help you do that

1327
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,339
um yeah so hopefully that answers your

1328
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,500
question yeah thank you

1329
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,859
yeah

1330
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,260
and

1331
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,140
like that's I'm sorry I couldn't hear

1332
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,740
[Music]

1333
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,040
foreign

1334
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,540
no that sounds awesome that sounds like

1335
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,920
something I need to go to a week for

1336
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,300
training for

1337
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,160
no but that sounds awesome I love that

1338
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,720
if it's tool agnostic or if you're if

1339
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,339
you're able to actually build that type

1340
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,780
of analysis in

1341
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,579
I love that because

1342
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,660
um I guess it would depend on the

1343
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
solution right if you're able to

1344
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,040
have the right skill set right for

1345
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,900
people to to be able to do that and know

1346
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,700
that you're not missing information yeah

1347
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,680
I think that's great and you gave me

1348
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,119
something to research when I go home so

1349
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,480
thank you

1350
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,190
[Music]

1351
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,599
starting point

1352
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,440
awesome yeah thank you any other

1353
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,640
questions yeah

1354
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,800
yeah

1355
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,079
yeah so I yeah thank you for the

1356
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,880
question yes I do think that we're going

1357
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,440
to get to a place like that I think that

1358
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,359
that is one of the problems that I think

1359
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,740
our industry is trying to solve there

1360
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,060
are a lot of vendors out there that are

1361
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,500
trying to solve this problem knowing

1362
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,380
that you know hey to do my job I have to

1363
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,359
have 15 or 20 Tools in my environment

1364
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,940
and that that's not a feasible solution

1365
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,400
because we are humans there's only so

1366
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,839
much information we can take in and

1367
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:50,700
actually digest and act on that's the

1368
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,800
other piece right is I can digest a lot

1369
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,960
of information yes

1370
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,579
yeah they have a ton yeah if you go to

1371
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,599
the website they have a ton of different

1372
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,400
degrees and um like I said different

1373
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,319
labs and

1374
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,619
um so yeah I I mean I really enjoyed my

1375
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,540
time there that's why I'm still there

1376
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,619
um but yeah they have a lot of cool

1377
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,200
degrees Yeah

1378
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,560
yes

1379
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,359
yeah so

1380
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,400
I think the human factors conversation

1381
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,680
from both the management perspective and

1382
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,420
the practitioner perspective is really

1383
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,280
important I guess I focused more on the

1384
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,839
practitioner because I am a practitioner

1385
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:32,940
but yeah I think it's it's both ways

1386
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,839
right

1387
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,099
um really effective management

1388
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,900
especially when it comes to a situation

1389
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,960
like this isn't to say you know

1390
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,760
my security practitioners didn't

1391
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,619
configure this properly this is their

1392
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:45,359
fault you know it's really about the

1393
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,819
question did I provide them the training

1394
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,099
and the Skilling to understand this tool

1395
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,260
or did they get hired and I told them

1396
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,119
they need to figure it out today so yes

1397
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,640
absolutely I think it's it's sort of

1398
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,160
um has to be from both sides

1399
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,140
um and the

1400
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,880
this idea of perception this is

1401
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,559
something I just started exploring in

1402
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,819
the last year or two when it came to

1403
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,700
research because I think perception and

1404
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,400
I don't have any proof behind this yet

1405
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,880
but my my hypothesis is that perception

1406
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,640
affects a lot more in risk management

1407
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,859
and in Burnout and things like that that

1408
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,720
we're seeing in the industry then we are

1409
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,839
aware of at the moment you know if that

1410
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,300
perception is my security team is doing

1411
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,920
a bad job

1412
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,660
um that's going to be negative for

1413
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,119
everyone right versus saying what's

1414
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,740
actually happening on the team let me

1415
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,240
ask around let me ask a few questions

1416
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,819
you know did do they know how to manage

1417
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,040
this tool no can I send them to a week

1418
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,920
for training and fix the problem great I

1419
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,059
don't have to fire someone and hire

1420
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,520
someone that's bad for everybody

1421
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,579
um so yeah so yeah absolutely both ways

1422
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:51,900
yeah

1423
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,800
any other questions

1424
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,760
no

1425
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,559
all right well thank you all so much I

1426
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,300
really appreciate it

1427
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,900
um thanks

1428
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,119
[Applause]
