talk uh we're sorry we're pausing your

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,140
happy hour

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
so thank you if you're already starting

7

please share with your partners next to

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,820
you or at least pass something up we

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,980
really appreciate it my name is Ryan St

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,420
Germain

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,820
um I'm a principal consultant with

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
there we go principal consultant with a

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,820
large security company

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,960
previously as a manager of information

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,539
security a small company here in uh in

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,280
Maryland

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,899
so our talk today is going to be based

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,120
on our experience in both large

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
organization and a smaller Org the

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,520
larger org we work for works with uh

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,519
Fortune 500 companies doing uh proactive

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,760
security assessments and tabletop so

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,140
we're going to use that experience and

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,760
hopefully pass on some knowledge today

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
I'm going to pass this on to Clarissa

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,880
really quick

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,400
hi everyone I'm Clarissa bury I am a

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,200
consultant on the same team as Ryan I'm

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,759
doing strategic advisory so that's

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,560
really proactive services like you said

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
for those big clients and before this I

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,460
was a security engineer doing all that

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,320
kind of you know defensive blue team

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,939
work for a small company here in

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,400
Maryland and I was also the I.T manager

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,180
for a small non-profit in Washington DC

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,920
so in this talk we're really gonna like

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,780
he said go through and blend those two

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,880
worlds together so what the companies

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,700
that we're working with have a ton of

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,320
resources you know they'll have in-house

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,259
socks and retainers with Specialists on

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,479
call

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,640
but smaller companies really don't have

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,020
those kinds of resources and they have

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,720
to be a lot more purposeful and precise

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,939
with how they allocate both their

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,220
people's time and the find the funding

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,720
that they have

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
so really what is proactive security put

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
it simply it's everything that you're

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,758
doing before an attack happens

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,258
everything you're doing to prepare and

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,940
defend right but it's really about

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
preemptively finding and addressing any

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,239
weaknesses

58
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,520
um and fixing your processes and

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,080
improving upon them so that you're ready

60
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,720
if and when an attack does come this is

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,620
really important because it makes

62
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,379
organizations more resilient right so

63
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,640
you're trying to prevent attacks and

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,900
better prepare

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,340
we're also going to be talking a little

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,720
bit about what resources are available

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,780
to you that fit in with a smaller

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,760
organization's priorities

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,500
and we're going to go through a couple

70
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,660
tools you can use some how to go through

71
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,879
and think about tabletops and how to get

72
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,800
some executive buy-in on those I'm going

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,180
to hand it back to Ryan we're going to

74
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,879
go through some documentation

75
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,160
awesome uh so I know documentation

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,459
pretty boring but as we do these larger

77
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,440
assessments with these larger companies

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,660
one of the biggest issues that tends to

79
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,459
come up is that lack of documentation

80
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,060
specifically run books and play books

81
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,220
and as you know I'm sure there are a lot

82
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,560
of people here who work security for

83
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,239
smaller businesses run books and

84
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,120
playbooks are relatively more

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
important because you're having to share

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,140
roles right you're having to share hats

87
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,819
within that organization

88
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,700
so let's say Tom is out of town maybe

89
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,580
Timmy and it then has to take over and

90
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,400
run a firewall or something else right

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,739
some other security control that he's

92
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,780
not normally responsible for

93
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,819
so one of the first most important

94
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,379
things is that it's uh you know it's

95
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,720
it's a common and repeatable process so

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,180
things that you're doing on you know a

97
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,980
regular basis

98
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,120
um so let's say if it's a phishing

99
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
attack as a as an example you're going

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,599
in logging into the firewall right

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,700
you're you're putting maybe IP addresses

102
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,140
in to block it or you're logging into

103
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,620
Microsoft 365 to block a sender address

104
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,420
right these are repeatable processes

105
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,340
that most likely aren't going to change

106
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,920
and potentially could be automated but

107
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
one of the issues we found is that

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
they're one they're not being created

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
and two they're not actually being

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,260
updated right so you can have a Playbook

111
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,640
and a run book but it's not as good

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,379
unless you're actually keeping it up to

113
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,640
date because let's say you have a Palo

114
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,080
Alto firewall next thing you know you're

115
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,220
upgrading to checkpoint or something

116
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,079
like that well that process is going to

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,918
change

118
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,899
so

119
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,798
um

120
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,959
one of the last items is it sort of

121
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,400
essentially paves the way to automation

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,380
right so we talk about soar all the time

123
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,860
well when you purchase a store what do

124
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,540
you what are you gonna do with it well

125
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,740
the whole point is that it's going to

126
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,419
automate those playbooks and run books

127
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,400
so if you can document those first then

128
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,740
you have an easier path forward to

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
moving into that sore product and that

130
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,280
can especially be more important for

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,100
small businesses who don't have a large

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,740
you know security organization and there

133
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,360
are a lot of free open source resources

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,520
out there that can help get started

135
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,180
and so this is just a very basic example

136
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,860
obviously of a Playbook and run book

137
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,880
process

138
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,020
um it's pretty surprising how many

139
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,400
people don't actually understand what

140
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,900
this looks like

141
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,060
um even at Fortune 500 companies so just

142
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,500
want to give a high level overview

143
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,380
phishing Playbook and then it descends

144
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,360
right down into your uh your actual run

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
books so that's where those actual

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,780
processes are going to occur

147
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,919
so

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,840
with run books and playbooks right the

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,040
important part is that you actually have

150
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,020
the security controls in place to

151
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,840
leverage those and so this is that cyber

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
security you know control landscape out

153
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,520
there that we all see and as a small

154
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,259
business like holy crap where the hell

155
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,660
do I start right

156
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,280
um and especially with small businesses

157
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
we don't have the money

158
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,780
so what's what's important where do I

159
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,320
put my my priorities and you know where

160
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
do I go from here

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,380
whoops

162
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,840
so everyone knows security and depth

163
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
right security young right this is what

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,979
we're taught basic level but the problem

165
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,900
is it's not being implemented and it's

166
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,340
even more important for us small

167
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,039
businesses because we don't have the

168
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,960
funding to purchase all these other

169
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,460
secured products so we need to identify

170
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,139
the key areas that we're going to invest

171
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,940
and that could be purchasing a product

172
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,160
or it could just be leveraging free open

173
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,500
source tools right so if you came to me

174
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,479
right now and you told me to start a

175
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,979
security program where would I invest

176
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,479
that it would be in a Sim right because

177
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,340
then you can build around that and I'm

178
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,960
not saying you have to buy a Sim you can

179
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,880
they're a free open source products but

180
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,380
the first part would probably be a Sim

181
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,940
and then you can build around that with

182
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,280
your prevention controls right you're

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
you're getting the data in and you need

184
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,460
to know what you're actually going to

185
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,699
protect within your organization

186
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,919
um the third one and it's not as sexy as

187
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,539
the other items right configuration

188
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,440
management

189
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,780
we're baselining and looking for

190
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,360
hardening of images so we're trying to

191
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,060
harden the products and and the uh the

192
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,520
assets that we're managing to prevent

193
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
them from being uh compromised obviously

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
right and a lot of times this is free I

195
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,780
mean you look at CIS you look at stigs

196
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,960
you can Baseline uh your asset during

197
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,419
the uh the deployment phase to disable

198
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,819
obviously you know services that you're

199
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,919
not looking to actually implement or

200
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,199
leverage right like if you're deploying

201
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,580
a

202
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
a non-web server you're not going to

203
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,780
enable IIs so you need to ensure that

204
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
it's disabled or you need to make sure

205
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,900
the Powershell you know script block

206
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,199
logging is on like these basic items so

207
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,000
configuration management is one it's

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,380
like one of the third more important

209
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,539
items that we've found uh fourth and

210
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,099
fourth and final one is ticketing and

211
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,199
case management you know we have a lot

212
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,240
of these products like even a Sim right

213
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,699
they're generating alerts if there's an

214
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,580
incident alert fire right but where do

215
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,780
they go and the majority of the time

216
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,880
they're going to a single mailbox or

217
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,400
they're going to a distribution list and

218
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
a lot of times that's like a single

219
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,880
point of failure so you want an area to

220
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,160
actually track and manage these uh

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
alerts in right so that you can you know

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,020
obviously for auditing ability but also

223
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,780
for tracking of

224
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,440
um your ttps and your iocs and so then

225
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,639
you can leverage that and then that

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
builds upon your Automation and we'll

227
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,599
talk about a little a little bit of a

228
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,160
security product and help you with the

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
automation of that

230
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,039
so quote unquote free Solutions right we

231
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,780
go on GitHub we have all these options

232
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,180
out there but the problem is these

233
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,759
aren't really free they're free to take

234
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,880
right but there's a management cost to

235
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,240
all of these so when we're looking at

236
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,940
the uh the the landscape of free

237
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,639
Solutions we need to keep that in mind

238
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,599
and there are certain considerations

239
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,220
that we need to take into account before

240
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,319
actually leveraging and then

241
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,740
implementing that within our environment

242
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,260
and the first one is is it actively

243
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,820
supported so a lot of times we'll go

244
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,880
into GitHub we'll find a um we'll find a

245
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,919
project right and while it hasn't been

246
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
updated in what two years and issues are

247
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,320
piling up we don't see any replies from

248
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,000
the contributor I mean it's open source

249
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
we sort of we sort of you know expect

250
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,180
that at the end of the day sometimes

251
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,440
right

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
um but that's a huge item to look for

253
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,440
because you don't want to implement

254
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,940
something that you're then not going to

255
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,880
have support for especially if you you

256
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
know if you buy like a product like RSA

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,980
for secure ID right you're getting

258
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,480
support with that product

259
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,180
so with these open source ones you're

260
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
the support which sort of then goes into

261
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
cost of administration so you need to

262
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,820
understand what you're implementing

263
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,100
because then it becomes a potential Tech

264
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,440
debt you need to understand if the

265
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,820
people that are going to be managing

266
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,920
this are going to be able to actually

267
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,420
manage this if they have the capability

268
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,000
especially with new Security Solutions

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,800
nowadays which are Appliance based right

270
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,839
and are leveraging a lot of

271
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,580
containerization so if you don't

272
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,339
understand containers and all of a

273
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,320
sudden you're open source let's say

274
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,660
surikata goes down

275
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,339
you know what's your support options

276
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,839
there you can reach out to the community

277
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,399
obviously but you're not reaching out to

278
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,959
that premium support that you normally

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,779
would with a commercial product

280
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,940
uh the third one being uh security

281
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,760
updates like I mentioned a lot of these

282
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
products are virtual appliances so

283
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,700
they're built on Linux distributions and

284
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,620
I've seen a lot of times where we

285
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,839
download these products or these free

286
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,240
Solutions and they're running on an out

287
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,760
of date let's say Ubuntu distribution

288
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,620
that hasn't been supported in one or two

289
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,519
years

290
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,160
so when we're we're looking for free

291
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,959
Solutions we need to identify what's

292
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,339
actually being run in the background

293
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,140
it's sort of like when we're when we're

294
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,420
looking for uh like an s-bomb or

295
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,440
something like that for commercial

296
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
solution we need to identify what's

297
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,740
going on in the background so that we

298
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,959
can continue to support that and the

299
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,040
fourth and final one is Integrations

300
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,959
with existing platforms right you want

301
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,480
to get a platform or security Solution

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,860
that's going to integrate with other

303
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,959
items within your environment because

304
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,000
then you know you're not going to go out

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,920
and have to replace additional items

306
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,180
just because you brought this one new

307
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,100
security solution in and that's not just

308
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
limited to a free solution right I mean

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,240
if we're going out to buy a Palo Alto

310
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,620
product we want to ensure that it's

311
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,360
going to work with our other products as

312
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,540
well

313
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,980
so one of the prod projects that I love

314
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
and I mentioned you know case management

315
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,180
earlier is the high project

316
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,160
um obviously you know you can collect

317
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,380
items in there with cases management it

318
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,519
integrates with a lot of different

319
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,320
products especially with its native API

320
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,720
uh but what's awesome and I want to

321
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
point on here is that the metrics

322
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,200
collection you know we talk about

323
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,000
metrics and our eyes rule a little bit

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
but one of the items that you should

325
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,240
identify is your log Source collection

326
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,100
and take metrics on where those logs

327
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,480
that are actionable actually come from

328
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,339
because a lot of times you know if

329
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,660
you're working with a Splunk license

330
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,240
right it's based on volume so if you're

331
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,980
just ingesting data for no reason if

332
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,360
it's not actually helping you and it's

333
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,980
not actionable

334
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,839
what are you sort of paying for right so

335
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
you need to be able to identify and

336
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,140
track what log sources are helping you

337
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,899
at the end of the day

338
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm sure you all have seen the high

339
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,260
project but I'll give you a nice little

340
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,640
screenshot here

341
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,880
uh second is email security I mean I'm

342
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,260
sure we have security administrators

343
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,560
here all the time right we're we're uh

344
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,820
responding to people who decided to

345
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,320
click on something that was obviously a

346
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
fish but at the end of the day it's

347
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,980
going to continue to happen

348
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,500
um so one of the projects that I wish

349
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
was around when I was still a security

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
engineer was the sublime security

351
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,600
project I don't know how many people

352
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,459
here who have worked with it but it's

353
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,560
it's pretty damn awesome

354
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,940
um one of the problems right now that we

355
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,399
have with our current Security Solutions

356
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,500
let's say Microsoft 365 proof point you

357
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,480
name it you don't really have any

358
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,579
insight into what it's basing its

359
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,019
decisions on right it's not like snort

360
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,720
where you can go in and edit a rule it's

361
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,360
pretty much its own proprietary

362
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,240
decision-making product and at the end

363
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,519
of the day normally all we can do is add

364
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,560
a email address or an IP address that we

365
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,000
want to block right that's pretty much

366
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,380
all the control we have maybe you can

367
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,260
add attachments stuff like that but we

368
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,899
need a way to build rules out based on

369
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,120
the properties of an email sort of like

370
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
an IDs rule or let's say

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,519
um a Sim rule right and that's where the

372
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,079
message query language of sublime

373
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,660
security comes in you can write a rule

374
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,120
based on an actual email itself and I

375
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,260
have a screenshot so you can see that

376
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,240
but I highly recommend you guys check it

377
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,000
out one of the biggest advantages of

378
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,399
this platform is that it natively

379
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,339
integrates into email Solutions so you

380
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,560
don't have to go to your i-team uh I.T

381
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,420
engineer and say hey I need to set up a

382
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,000
new MTA right you can integrate natively

383
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,200
with Microsoft 365 IMAP or even Google

384
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,279
workspaces if you want

385
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,540
and so this is this is just a little

386
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,560
screenshot on the left you have the

387
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,480
email and then on the right you have the

388
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,519
rule and so you can see that the

389
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,100
attachments headers all this breaks down

390
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,500
and this is essentially just an email

391
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
that you can ingest into the system and

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,279
then write rules based on that so this

393
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,079
is open source you guys can check it out

394
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,019
uh I'll leave a link within the uh

395
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,940
within the slides

396
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,980
so we have a lot of options out there

397
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,740
right in terms of security controls free

398
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,079
platforms stuff like that but at the end

399
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,420
of the day you know if you say okay well

400
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,459
I want to integrate Zeke I want to

401
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,740
integrate circata

402
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,839
um you know you name it you've already

403
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,160
got two or three things that you're

404
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,899
going to need to maintain and that's

405
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,700
where these security platforms come in

406
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,880
it's one platform essentially to manage

407
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
them all to rule them all right

408
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,180
everything's in one you update the

409
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,860
platform itself it updates the sub

410
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,959
components so like Siri cotta and you

411
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,019
name it so security young in Wazoo are a

412
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,100
great place to start if you want an

413
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,380
all-in-one solution as like a Sim IDs

414
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
file Integrity monitor things like that

415
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,779
I'm going to pass it on to Clarissa and

416
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,980
she's going to talk about tabletop

417
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,519
exercises

418
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,380
so we covered a bunch of the more

419
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,459
technical side of things the

420
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,779
documentation the tooling but now we're

421
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:46,680
going to get into a little bit more of

422
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,660
the people side of proactive security

423
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,339
so this is really what I do every single

424
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,220
day I make tabletop exercises for our

425
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,480
clients

426
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,380
um

427
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,600
at its you know basis form a tabletop is

428
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
really just you know creating a scenario

429
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,320
of an attack Gathering the people that

430
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,519
would be involved in responding to that

431
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,199
attack and then playing through how you

432
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,360
would respond to it as a team

433
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,339
and these can be as big as or as small

434
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,839
as you want you know you could get a few

435
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,279
people from the technical team do

436
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,019
something very specific you know how

437
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:13,920
would we

438
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,260
um recover from backups if we needed to

439
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,579
for this one system you know things like

440
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,500
that or you can make it a cross-team

441
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,760
exercise which can actually be really

442
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,440
helpful bringing in other stakeholders

443
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
into the cyber security or incident

444
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,800
response process so you know you think

445
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,839
about bringing in Executives or legal or

446
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,220
Communications

447
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,420
um whatever other teams you might have

448
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,860
in your organization that could be that

449
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,660
could benefit

450
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,639
when you're thinking about tabletops um

451
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,839
there's not really enough time in this

452
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,399
talk to go through the actual design

453
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,839
process

454
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,360
um in the specifics but some some ways

455
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,199
to think about you know you want to

456
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,959
think about the scope first so what

457
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,600
processes are you trying to test what is

458
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,360
the company most at risk for

459
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,459
um think like a threat actor what are

460
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,779
they looking what would they look for in

461
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,160
your organization what would be valuable

462
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,199
to them and how would they go and get it

463
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,880
and then you can kind of build your

464
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,579
scenario backwards from there

465
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,199
um you know thinking about really that

466
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,339
those end results that you're looking

467
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,660
for those processes you're trying to

468
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,820
test if you're looking to test your your

469
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,620
technical team's abilities to respond

470
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,760
you don't really necessarily need to

471
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,560
spend much time on some of the

472
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,420
communication side and you know vice

473
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,800
versa

474
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,120
you also really want to think about your

475
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,800
audience so their level of technical

476
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,420
expertise if you're bringing in some of

477
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,279
those other stakeholders from other

478
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,560
teams some of your Executives maybe who

479
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,699
don't have as much of a technical

480
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,320
background you want to make sure that

481
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,940
you're formatting your scenario to fit

482
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,260
with the information that they would

483
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,360
need in an actual incident and the role

484
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,339
that they would play

485
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,440
so build those facilitation questions

486
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
and the scenario around that information

487
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,420
you also really want to be conscious of

488
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,639
tone so in the tabletops that I do

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,160
people often get very nervous I've had

490
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,500
people you know on the first slide of

491
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,959
our table tops uh the director of it

492
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,519
security says you know my Palms are

493
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,720
already sweaty I'm a little nervous

494
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,880
already you know it's a you want to make

495
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,079
sure that

496
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,820
you're making it very clear throughout

497
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,440
the process both in the build up and at

498
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
the beginning of the scenario that this

499
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,980
is a learning exercise it's not an exam

500
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,559
it's not an assessment the goal isn't to

501
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,299
answer every question perfectly and be

502
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,339
completely right the goal is as a team

503
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,679
to work through your processes learn

504
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,900
from it practice it and also find areas

505
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,939
to improve as well

506
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,799
I've included a couple resources here

507
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,240
you can Google these

508
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,380
um just you know those keywords and

509
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,640
you'll find it it's also linked and

510
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,559
we're going to post these slides

511
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,299
um but one thing to really consider with

512
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,799
the resources that are out there for

513
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,540
free about designing table tops is

514
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,679
they're often aimed at bigger

515
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,900
organizations organizations that have a

516
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,760
lot of specialization in their roles and

517
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,720
so they're going to talk a lot about

518
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,940
having a designated Incident Commander

519
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
and having a designated person to do

520
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,660
each different role and that might not

521
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,039
be the case for smaller organizations

522
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,539
where those roles really blend together

523
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,440
so

524
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,820
another thing that you want to really

525
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,919
think about is capturing that

526
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,179
institutional knowledge that you might

527
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,679
have so everyone knows that there's

528
00:17:58,679 --> 00:17:59,880
someone at your organization who's been

529
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,160
there 25 years who knows every single

530
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,620
thing about every server but that

531
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,419
knowledge doesn't doesn't necessarily

532
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,980
get transferred to other people so

533
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,720
through a tabletop exercise it's a

534
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,000
really great opportunity to cross-train

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,340
your employees and capture that

536
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,320
information in a concrete way

537
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,280
now you might be thinking all this stuff

538
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
that we talked about is so great but how

539
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,080
do I actually get my leadership to do it

540
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,539
now you want to really quantify that

541
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,340
risk leadership loves a cost analysis so

542
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,500
explain the financial impacts of a cyber

543
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,120
incident you know really just kind of

544
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,679
talk about that when you're pitching

545
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,539
some of these ideas

546
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,220
how will these proactive measures really

547
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,720
help you defend against this you know

548
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,039
talk about why it's important to

549
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,200
practice responding to an incident or

550
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
you could run a smaller incident that

551
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,840
you might not need

552
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,760
um you know their their authorization

553
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,320
for and then kind of show the results of

554
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,580
them so here's what we learned I'd like

555
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,080
to do this on a bigger scale across the

556
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,720
company and bring in some other teams

557
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,000
it can also really help to get

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,860
stakeholders from other sides of the

559
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,840
organization involved an easy way to do

560
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,039
this is looking at compliance

561
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,780
requirements so you can get legal or HR

562
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,299
on your team if you map the ways that

563
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,700
these different proactive measures will

564
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,100
correlate to the compliance Frameworks

565
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,720
that you need to you need to comply with

566
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,179
or even how these proactive measures

567
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:19,320
would make you look good to cyber

568
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,940
Insurance a lot of cyber insurance is

569
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,520
ask do you do tabletop exercises do you

570
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,620
have these different tools do you have

571
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,419
someone who um who can practice who

572
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,039
knows how to do the disaster recovery

573
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,100
processes that you have in place

574
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,799
and then obviously showing instead of

575
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,080
telling so tabletop exercises yet again

576
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,539
are a great way to do this but also um

577
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,160
showing them how these different tools

578
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,679
work what you know what is useful about

579
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,780
them and illustrating also how cyber

580
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,280
instance progress a lot of Executives

581
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,380
might not be familiar with this

582
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,299
um and showing them about you know what

583
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,280
it is you're doing as a responder can be

584
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,720
really helpful

585
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,299
I had a tabletop actually where

586
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,980
um in the middle of the tabletop it was

587
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,419
a management level and they had one

588
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,520
technical security like instance

589
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,280
response responder um excuse me response

590
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,020
person there and in the middle of the

591
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,340
tabletop they realized they're asking

592
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,260
him to do four different things at once

593
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,480
and so they wrote down and authorized

594
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,039
him to get three new people for his

595
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,220
security team right in the tabletop

596
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,059
all right so that is actually all we

597
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,039
have for today you can find us if you

598
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,539
have more questions at the happy hour

599
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,580
right after this or on Twitter you can
