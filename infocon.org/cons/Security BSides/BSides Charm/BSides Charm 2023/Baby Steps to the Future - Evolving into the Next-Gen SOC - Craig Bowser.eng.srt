[Music]

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
good afternoon good morning welcome to

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,720
the second talk uh the third talk

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,720
depending on what you're counting so uh

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,719
it's awesome thanks for being here I

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,239
know that this is an interesting time

8
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,960
slot because I am effectively between

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,899
you and lunch and so that's a little

10
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,700
challenging so what I'm going to try and

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,920
do is make sure I am both at least

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,640
engaging as well as succinct and so I

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,160
promise not to go over three hours that

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,079
can we just just be happy with that all

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,420
right great no seriously

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,899
um so my name is Craig Bowser and I am

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,840
talking on baby steps to the next gen

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,580
sock and I have been Security in

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,920
security doing security for over 20

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,960
years

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,060
in various roles almost all of it blue

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,180
team and so that has given me a lot of

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,700
insight into how security Opera

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,460
operations has changed over that time

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,460
and and as a result of just you know

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,220
being in that field as well as uh

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,939
talking to people at cons and online

28
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,700
I've just seen a lot of how you know

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,560
that has changed and is changing going

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,680
forward and so uh that gave me some

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,780
really thoughts about like hey what's

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,600
going on with the sock what is going on

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,540
as we move forward uh both in the past

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,299
and in the future and so the first thing

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,759
that usually happens is we have someone

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,299
pronounced that the sock is dead

37
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,579
and usually that has you know it gets

38
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,460
some interesting engagement going I mean

39
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,979
uh just uh a few months ago there was a

40
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,540
whole Twitter thread between Anton

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,080
shavocking and Richard uh um and I

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,060
always screw up his name uh latex

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,959
um so um baitlick Richard baitlick

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
um all on this topic but the reality is

45
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,720
that it's sort of like you know the

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,940
monarchy it's long-lived the sock the

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,980
sock is dead but really long move the

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
sock and the reason that of this

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,959
disparity this difference between these

50
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,000
two viewpoints is that

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
um in uh what's going on is that the

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,700
sock isn't really dead but the sock is

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,120
evolving uh and this this stand

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,980
microphone this single in place

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,080
microphone is driving me crazy I usually

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,140
move around on the stage so hopefully I

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,840
will not do that and if I do then our

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,599
good Tech team in the back will scream

59
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
and yell and tell me to get back to the

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
mic because I can't hear what I'm saying

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,920
but nevertheless the sock is evolving

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,519
it's moving and it's changing and really

63
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,800
if you think about where where we have

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
come from to today you understand what's

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
going on right back when we first

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
started and for some of you this is

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,000
before you were started and for a couple

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,620
of you maybe before you were born which

69
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,060
just goes to how old I am uh you know

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,099
um this it was the defense of the

71
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,440
network was simple we were on-prem we

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,659
had this castle and moat philosophy

73
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,640
where we have this hard and crunchy

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,760
outside and a soft and chewy inside we

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,940
had AV we had firewalls ids's were just

76
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,819
coming into uh just coming into Vogue

77
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,580
and so that was that was the protection

78
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,760
we had and then we got a few more tools

79
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,340
we started adding remote capabilities to

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,000
our Network I remember I was

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,799
um you know add an organization and they

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,940
gave me a 386 box to take home to dial

83
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,099
in to do work at home so I'm you know

84
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,299
lugging on the subway a monitor a a case

85
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,580
with the 386 keyboard you know the whole

86
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,580
shebang that was that was my laptop at

87
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,680
the time right you know quote it was a

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,738
whole you know um base but anyway

89
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,978
um here I am you know I'm remote we have

90
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,400
ips's are just starting ubas or nascent

91
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,080
I know when I say Nation it's like the

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,500
concept and very you know lab like uba

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,560
and then we moved to where we have more

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,540
tools and so we start moving from a

95
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,820
castle and a single perimeter we have

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,240
the defensive depth concept starting we

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,940
have cloud is starting to come out 2010

98
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,699
remembers about when AWS started

99
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,639
offering services and capabilities uh

100
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,340
threat Intel and uba are just starting

101
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,180
up uh and so EDR the concept of DDR is

102
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,100
again nascentient

103
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,860
oh we moved to the mid-2010s the mid

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,280
teens on our um and uba and threaten

105
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,600
tell are all over the place I remember

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,020
going to a major conference 50 60

107
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,620
vendors and 80 of those vendors were

108
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,660
selling either threat and tell or uba it

109
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,880
was like the thing remember just like

110
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,800
every new thing is the thing and then

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,139
it's never the thing but now we're

112
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,300
starting to see also sores starting to

113
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,620
come out

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300
um although most Linux admins will tell

115
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,620
you they've been doing soar for years

116
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,600
but that's a whole other story

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
um you know microservices are starting

118
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,080
to pop up and now in the 2020s uh we're

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,440
seeing seeing us shift again as defense

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,320
and depth is now uh moving towards zero

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
trust we have

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,919
more tools we have xdr we have Cosby we

123
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,300
have Ace

124
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,940
um a tax service management tools we

125
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,440
have all these other tools that are

126
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,020
coming in and we're still manage we're

127
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,699
managing all of these and I'll talk

128
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,380
about that the fact that we're managing

129
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,840
all these but we're adding mobile and um

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,900
and and operational technology into the

131
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,759
things that we need to protect

132
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,080
and so our socks also have changed a

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,280
little

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,560
uh we went you know when it was all

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
on-prem uh you know in the early days

136
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,580
that we could put everybody in room with

137
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,680
with monitors and screens and Blinky

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,479
lights and things like that and that was

139
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,900
good uh and then you know we started

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,120
having the ability to remote monitoring

141
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,780
and remote analysis and uh covid and the

142
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,199
quarantine drove this quite a bit uh and

143
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,660
now you know we have a lot of people

144
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,479
most people are either fully remote or

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,580
at best hybrid

146
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,780
and their socks now a sock by the way

147
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,740
traditionally we think of it as the

148
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,319
picture on the left but really what the

149
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,120
sock is

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,340
uh it really kind of balances out is

151
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,699
it's a group of people doing security

152
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,280
monitoring detection response right so

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,139
whatever you want to call that your

154
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,780
security operations team your incident

155
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,120
response your cert whatever you want to

156
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,759
call the sock it's a generic term for

157
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,979
that group of people in your

158
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,259
organization that are doing the security

159
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,199
and monitoring for your organization

160
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
so

161
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
this is kind of where security as far as

162
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
the team goes and where we're going with

163
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,180
the tools and so but so what we have now

164
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,759
is this but we still have a sock

165
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,819
architecture that looks like this we

166
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,180
have a bunch of uh tools on the left

167
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,319
here that are sending data to some kind

168
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,620
of central a repository now most of the

169
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,199
time that's a Sim but it could be other

170
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,500
uh other capabilities other storage and

171
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,479
analytical capabilities I'm just using

172
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,620
Sim as that generic term because most

173
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,199
groups have that but you have this Sim

174
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,500
you have a tiered group of people that

175
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,259
are uh you know doing analysis and

176
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,599
monitoring of the data coming in of

177
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,919
rules and such you have some ticket

178
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,979
ticketing case management system you

179
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,380
maybe have some threat and tell you

180
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,020
maybe have a sore and when I say maybe I

181
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,340
mean a lot of places do but not every

182
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,280
place does and that's how our today's

183
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,580
sock is but the reality is that this

184
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,860
architecture the way this sock is

185
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,099
designed is really

186
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,399
geared toward defending monitoring and

187
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,219
protecting the defense in-depth

188
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,880
capability uh with you know a limited

189
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,799
amount or a certain amount of data

190
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,680
coming in and so what is the problem

191
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,720
with that well that has created some

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,899
challenges in today's environment as the

193
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,820
networks and the Enterprises that we are

194
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,720
charged with protecting uh have can have

195
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,640
changed faster than our sock

196
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
architecture first of all the elephant

197
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
in the room which no one will be

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,060
surprised is the lack of personnel to do

199
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,860
the monitoring protecting I don't really

200
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,480
have to talk much about that you guys

201
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,980
talk about it all the time we all do

202
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,959
we've talked about it for 10 years we'll

203
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,279
probably talk about it for the next 10

204
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,440
years getting enough Personnel to do

205
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,240
this is hard

206
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,320
um

207
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,779
we are managing an increasingly complex

208
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,779
security stack both which includes

209
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,339
on-prem cloud and mobile capabilities

210
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,920
The Cisco security outcome study uh

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,339
stated that uh on average there are 63

212
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,080
security tools and I will come back to

213
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,660
that number later in the presentation

214
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,360
but there are 63 security tools that uh

215
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,820
single organization is responsible for

216
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,399
managing administrating monitoring and

217
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,399
responding to that's a lot of tools and

218
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,140
not all of them work the same way and

219
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,360
you for those of you who do multiple

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
things your head explodes trying to

221
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
figure out which tool you're in at what

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
time

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,500
you have limited visibility into an

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,680
increasing attack surface okay uh your

225
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
attack Surface by the way if you haven't

226
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,279
figured out on your own is increasing

227
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,620
it's growing as we expand into the cloud

228
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,720
as we expand to mobile as we expand

229
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,580
around the world into new locations

230
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,399
offer more services that is just more

231
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,100
places for the attacker to uh to Target

232
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,320
and you have to monitor all those that's

233
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,500
challenging uh you are not able the

234
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,300
socks are less and less able to operate

235
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,240
at scale to handle better attacker

236
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,640
attackers with increasing volumes of

237
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,019
attack

238
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,019
um there you know we you know there's

239
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,660
just attacks going on all the time from

240
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,180
multiple places and by the way at more

241
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,120
scale and by the way you have not been

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,339
cloned yet

243
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,320
um and so that's hard of course cloning

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,820
would solve problem number one but

245
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,540
that's another story so

246
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,740
we're still fighting this fight this

247
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,300
fight probably will be fought forever

248
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,279
but it doesn't it still adds to the

249
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,380
problem right where you have compliance

250
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,440
which we use to get resources so it's

251
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,920
not bad but it goes up against best

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,360
practices which goes up against

253
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,640
effective security which goes up against

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,640
operations in I.T so these are all

255
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,620
things that we're trying to fight and

256
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,740
balance between the two it's that's hard

257
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,560
uh attackers primary targets now are no

258
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,800
longer devices they are identity and

259
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,260
data and so

260
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,540
we have you know so we have to shift how

261
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,540
we think uh if you haven't already some

262
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,700
there are organizations that have but if

263
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,680
you haven't already shipped how you

264
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,540
think about what you know we have to do

265
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,360
that and not every place has so how did

266
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,279
we get to the how did these challenges

267
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
come about uh first of all

268
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
operation shifted they moved to the

269
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,060
cloud they moved to devops and they did

270
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,399
this 10 years ago and most security is

271
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
not even close to being able to help in

272
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
this manner we are um so operations is

273
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,940
pushing out updates and changes and new

274
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,640
things you know two to three to up to

275
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,680
eight times a day depending on the

276
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,220
industry that you are in and you are

277
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,079
woefully behind you're still waiting at

278
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,839
the show it up show up in your test lab

279
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,579
so you can run through a battery of

280
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,160
tests to determine if it should be uh

281
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,640
pushed to uh production or not

282
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,320
operations because like I they have

283
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
bypassed you uh in many ways and you

284
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,600
know and because they they cannot slow

285
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,240
down to wait for your testing or or

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,420
analysis uh you know in some ways you

287
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,060
know there are definitely organizations

288
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,720
that have adapted to this process but at

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,399
the same time it is a challenge to

290
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,620
ensure that you know the update that was

291
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,579
pushed out 11 A.M is secure when there

292
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,740
are already four revisions past that at

293
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,980
3 pm so that is a challenge we have

294
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,600
moved to a remote

295
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,800
mobile anytime anywhere access that is

296
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,540
whether it's your users or your

297
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,600
customers right there they there is a

298
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,880
desire to hey I need access to the data

299
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,920
I need access to the store whether I am

300
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,100
at Starbucks at home on the beach on the

301
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,920
mountains uh I'm on a laptop or on a

302
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,000
phone

303
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,940
um on a tablet you know or I'm on some

304
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,040
kind of iot device anytime anywhere uh

305
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,800
that's hard we don't control most of

306
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,540
those endpoints

307
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,399
all right this is different than when we

308
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,839
controlled almost all the end points

309
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,760
almost all the access and the location

310
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,180
so we're no longer at that point

311
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,639
I do I do have some good news security

312
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,100
has become better anyone currently

313
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,079
worried about Red Alert or Slammer

314
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,899
anyone no those are still out there

315
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,180
they're still popping around the

316
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,500
internet we're not worried about those

317
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
things right we're you know so secure

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
security is better than it was 20 years

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,980
ago I remember who remembers your

320
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,200
network shutting down right of an

321
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,639
unplugged that Network because of those

322
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,260
things yeah we don't care anymore

323
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,380
whatever uh but guess what uh the

324
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,720
attackers are way past that the script

325
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
kitties are way past that so

326
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,940
um you know the script cookies are like

327
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,000
Slammer so that's old stuff right

328
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,500
so

329
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,240
um so you know so the attackers are

330
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,579
better uh but so are we so that's good

331
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:29,279
and bad but all right security tools and

332
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
methodologies have increased in number

333
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,519
and complexity I've already talked about

334
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,220
that and so that's hard that's a lot

335
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,260
more data from a lot more tools each one

336
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,820
of those tools sorry each one of those

337
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,139
tools according to the vendor who sold

338
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,399
it to you is the most important thing

339
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,560
since sliced bread

340
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,839
um and most importantly we no longer

341
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,060
operate under the assumption that our

342
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,040
networks are unhackable okay we uh we

343
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,660
used to think that if we do all the

344
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,639
things and turn all the knobs and Patch

345
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,100
all the uh patch all the devices that

346
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,940
are we will be unassailable uh we don't

347
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,639
don't think that anymore we think if we

348
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,139
ever get to that point

349
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,540
then somebody's just going to find some

350
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,320
unknown zero day or five of them or you

351
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
know basically

352
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,019
um fish my CEO or CFO or Secretary of

353
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,820
the CEO and they're still going to get

354
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,180
in so we don't we are no longer under

355
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,040
that assumption so we don't operate we

356
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,899
don't think about that

357
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,660
um you know that maybe that keeps up

358
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,060
keeps us up at night or maybe we just go

359
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,639
whatever I just go to sleep because it's

360
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,160
you know the same scary story uh but

361
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,019
that's that's no longer the thing so

362
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,600
what's the solution spoiler alert it's

363
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,579
in the title

364
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:48,899
so we become next gen but what does that

365
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,399
mean right

366
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,740
you've probably heard this people are

367
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,779
like oh next gen next gen next gen so

368
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,459
what does that mean well let me tell you

369
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,980
what how I am defining it for the

370
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,779
purposes of this talk

371
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,360
how I am going to define a next-gen talk

372
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,300
uh cover several things first we are

373
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,579
shifting our security strategy from

374
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,160
defense and depth to zero trust and I

375
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,199
know zero trust is a big buzzword but

376
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,060
I'm telling you it is coming and it is

377
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,459
coming like a very slow moving freight

378
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,199
train and I say slow moving because this

379
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,240
is not an overnight flip a switch thing

380
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,820
but a freight train nevertheless that is

381
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,680
coming and it is different for everybody

382
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,660
so don't assume like oh I can't do it

383
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,160
because I'm too small

384
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,420
just you know it adapts so but shifting

385
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,220
our thought and our process and our

386
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,920
strategy to this concept uh is going is

387
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,639
a key part uh routine attacks and alerts

388
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,680
are handled by automation right get rid

389
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
of the crap that you see all the time

390
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,040
every day

391
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,079
um you know what it's like I think about

392
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,459
it like if if your bill pay you just say

393
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,220
pay this bill as long as the bills for

394
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,820
my cell phone is beneath x amount just

395
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,279
automatically pay it actually Banks

396
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,660
don't have that setting it would be

397
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,400
great if they did just you know a

398
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,740
greater less than or equal to pay this

399
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,480
amount automatically if greater than

400
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,640
this thing give me an alert that would

401
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,339
be awesome if you patent that give me

402
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,959
credit please but um nevertheless uh

403
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,780
just anything in a routine just is just

404
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,579
automated just do it don't I don't even

405
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,260
want to see it

406
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,140
um alerts are enriched and tri-aged so

407
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,100
the things that don't get our

408
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,679
automatically handled they come in fully

409
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,320
enriched most of you hopefully are

410
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,080
already doing enrichment for your alerts

411
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,440
if you're not get to it add data to your

412
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,280
alerts that makes your analysts be able

413
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,400
to make decisions faster and more

414
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
accurately because they don't have to go

415
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,600
find out stuff that is related to the

416
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,580
alert they're looking at so it should

417
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,260
show up with all the information they

418
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,160
need to make a 30 second decision right

419
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,299
away

420
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,460
and then triage as much of it as

421
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,260
possible that you know automation

422
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,299
doesn't necessarily mean you take care

423
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,820
of things without human intervention it

424
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,419
means it can mean that but it can also

425
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,460
mean that you have done as much as

426
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,620
possible with minimal risk to your to

427
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,559
your operations to your business and now

428
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,140
you put it in front of a human to make

429
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,500
final decision or to final decisions

430
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,840
right so you are you know tree you know

431
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,760
triaging as much as possible if you

432
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,360
think about like a medical triage

433
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,200
sometimes the uh the the nurse or the

434
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,080
the EMT does as much as possible and

435
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,760
then gives it to the doctor to go okay

436
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
do this do that do the other right so

437
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,539
that's really where I'm talking about

438
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,820
thinking about a triaging your alerts as

439
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,679
much as possible before the human gets

440
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,600
there oops

441
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,580
um so detections and automation

442
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,679
automated responses are constantly being

443
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,320
built in tune so you have devs SEC Ops

444
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
you have devops in your security your

445
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,760
where your your alerts and your

446
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
automations are constantly built and

447
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,380
tuned and two to three to four to five

448
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,299
times a day you're pushing out these

449
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,820
updates it's changing uh based on

450
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,120
feedback and results so uh so next gen

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,760
sock is doing this so logs and events

452
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,039
then also have to be ingested from a

453
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,140
variety of sources you have increased

454
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,240
the amount of data you're pulling in and

455
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,220
I get that comes at a cost and we'll

456
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,260
talk about how to manage that in a slide

457
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,539
or two but you're pulling in all of that

458
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,580
stuff so that you can have detections

459
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,039
automated responses and so you can take

460
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,280
care of routine and alerts by automation

461
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,880
and then finally you're using

462
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,740
ml machine learning and Ai and threat

463
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,020
until alongside of automated alerts all

464
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,240
of these things are helping you generate

465
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,240
High

466
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,179
um drawn a blank of the word

467
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,700
um low false positive High Fidelity

468
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,679
thank you that was it High Fidelity

469
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,140
alerts right you're using this you know

470
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,419
so where you can create Atomic alerts

471
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,160
Atomic alerts or things like if I see

472
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,780
this and this give me an alert because

473
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,059
those two things are bad

474
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,520
that very simple alerts you're like you

475
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,340
know yes no on off alerts as opposed to

476
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,919
machine learning and AI type of alerts

477
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,320
where it requires a lot more processing

478
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,679
and thought in large volume analysis so

479
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
um so uh using all of those to uh uh

480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,559
together to help defend it so that's

481
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,840
really what I see as an exchange sock so

482
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,840
how do we go from uh what does that look

483
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,700
like in reality what does that look like

484
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,120
practically uh in in real life so we're

485
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,980
going to talk about that picture so keep

486
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,900
in mind that how today's sock

487
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,020
architecture uh was was pictured a few

488
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,460
slides ago and we're going to start

489
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,280
migrating we're still evolving that to

490
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,400
uh next-gen sock because this is not a

491
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
overnight Journey you're not going to go

492
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,940
back and go okay here are the things we

493
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,980
need to do and we're going to have them

494
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,380
done by next year no this is like just

495
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,179
like zero trust just like anything it's

496
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,440
going to take three five ten years of of

497
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,240
of change

498
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,160
slow change but deliberate planned

499
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,780
changed and flexible change because

500
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,580
things will be different in five years

501
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,280
than they are now but you know we need

502
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
but that's that's you know but this is

503
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,940
how you know this is the things the

504
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,440
steps you need to take and by the way

505
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,679
also uh you can grocery shop in this

506
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,140
right if you are a large multi-billion

507
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,780
dollar worldwide organization uh you may

508
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,880
be able to do all of these things if you

509
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
are a 100 million 100 million dollar uh

510
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,220
30 person

511
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,919
um you know organization maybe you only

512
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,020
do four or five of these things the

513
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,299
concept is that you are getting to the

514
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,520
point where you are doing uh

515
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,620
implementing many of those overall

516
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,679
capabilities uh regardless of how many

517
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,600
of the actual steps you're able to do

518
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,700
you have to find a way to do it with the

519
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,740
resources and capabilities at your level

520
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,500
that you have so let's jump into it so

521
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,299
phase one and by the way I broke this

522
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,799
into phases not that you have to follow

523
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,140
this order but just be because I try to

524
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,780
group things that made sense

525
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,720
so phase one what you're going to do is

526
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,340
you're going to increase your automation

527
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,100
Automation and integration okay that

528
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
same Cisco outcome study also said that

529
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,000
that tools that are well able to be no

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
that are able to be integrated well with

531
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,280
each other increase the efficiency and

532
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,500
effectiveness of your security team and

533
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,960
this makes sense right so I was I've

534
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,640
been doing a demo lab I've been trying

535
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,200
to build a demo lab that has some

536
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,080
automated response capabilities in the

537
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,659
demo lab and I will tell you that we

538
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,220
found out that some of the tools we're

539
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,620
using don't integrate well they don't

540
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,380
have full API capability they like one

541
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,539
of them says yeah you can create a user

542
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,299
using an API you can delete a user but I

543
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,400
can't suspend a user

544
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,640
okay now I gotta either not use that

545
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,980
tool or do something else right I can't

546
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,559
suspend a user in that tool so I need

547
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,320
better integration capabilities I don't

548
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,940
need you to open up your you know

549
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,620
vendors I don't need you to open up your

550
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,780
secrets I need you to just allow me to

551
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,260
to access the things that I can do in

552
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,799
the GUI via remote API so I can just

553
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,100
have your you know tool a push data to

554
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,220
tools B and then based on that tool C

555
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,140
does something and I want to just do

556
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,820
that in a script I don't want to have to

557
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,340
point and click so

558
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,799
um better animate better integration and

559
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,159
automation increase that uh ingest

560
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,159
threat intelligence uh ingest relevant

561
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,500
threat intelligence and I say that

562
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,120
because I was working with a client a

563
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,880
few months ago it's a big us-based

564
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,820
pharmaceutical International Company

565
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,000
and they one of their threat feeds was

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,880
for Australian Public Schools

567
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,640
and I said to them why are you having

568
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,679
this start feed I don't see that and

569
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,880
they're like well just in case there's

570
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,220
something relevant and I'm not exactly

571
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,559
sure why they think a threat against

572
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,960
Australian Public Schools is relevant to

573
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,860
Big Pharma based in the U.S but okay but

574
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,539
I think that's a waste of time and money

575
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:26,580
and resources so ingest relevant threat

576
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
intelligence

577
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,840
uh plan for a migration to cloud-based

578
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,559
sock tools your on-prem tools will not

579
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,200
be able to if they are already falling

580
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,419
behind be able to handle the amount of

581
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,460
data that you will need to ingest and

582
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,980
the amount of processing and compute

583
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,200
capabilities you will need to have

584
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
excuse me uh going forward as you start

585
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,120
uh basically protecting your network at

586
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,280
the level that you uh that you know

587
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,440
where you have mobile and remote and

588
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,720
cloud and devsecops you're not going to

589
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,280
be able to ingest all that and and

590
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,500
process all the information at a level

591
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,380
on-prem or well you could but you're

592
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,720
going to spend so much money on Hardware

593
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,480
to do it so just start moving to the

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,000
cloud take advantage of that flexibility

595
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,059
and elastic and expansion capability uh

596
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,700
start creating and refining metrics that

597
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,320
will drive your planning and

598
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,779
prioritization of tasks and by that I

599
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,400
mean things like how many of your

600
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,740
current tasks are you automated what

601
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,860
percentage of those tasks are automated

602
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,100
uh you know how much of your uh how many

603
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,620
of your devices have you that are part

604
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,600
of your network have you identified how

605
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,940
much of your data have you identified

606
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,039
how much of your data has you labeled

607
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,679
right these are things this isn't like

608
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,080
you know meantime the resolution metrics

609
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,299
these are things like how are we making

610
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,020
our sock better at protecting and more

611
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,720
efficient at protecting so these are

612
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,900
metrics that that drive those steps not

613
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,539
just oh uh you know we didn't detect

614
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,240
that attack for 20 days or 90 days or

615
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,600
whatever uh speaking of which start

616
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,659
getting uh inventory I have asset here

617
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,700
but I really should say of your assets

618
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,279
your data and your identities all right

619
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
I mentioned before that attackers are

620
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,419
going after data and identities now so

621
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,000
you need a inventory of those day of the

622
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,860
data you have and the data and the

623
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,100
identities you that access it as well as

624
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,440
the assets if you still have assets not

625
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,720
all of us you know not all places have

626
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,539
assets anymore those of you who work for

627
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,980
companies that are completely

628
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,900
cloud-based you don't have assets so

629
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,299
then do you have an ass uh inventory of

630
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,340
the data that's important and do you

631
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,720
know where that data is do you know

632
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,400
whose access using it and if they should

633
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,760
be start getting that information

634
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,100
uh and So based on that then you start

635
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,559
planning and shifting to monitoring

636
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,080
protecting the data and identity rather

637
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,539
than the devices uh that are you know

638
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,960
that you have or that are accessing it

639
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,700
so as you get to that point where you

640
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,279
are doing those things well in my

641
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,140
opinion then you start moving to phase

642
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,200
two so phase two is where you are

643
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,179
implementing technology because now you

644
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,640
are ingesting a lot more data

645
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,100
but you don't need all that data in your

646
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,460
security tool so stop sending it to your

647
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,620
security tool send it somewhere else

648
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,480
because you're going to need a lot of

649
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,700
this data that you are collecting for

650
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,520
compliance for forensics for incident

651
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,279
response but you don't need oh and for

652
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,039
machine learning analysis and algorithms

653
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,480
and and possibly uh AI type anal use but

654
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,279
you don't need it in your security tool

655
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,500
which is more expensive to collect and

656
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,080
ingest and store send it somewhere

657
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,380
cheaper and then access it there

658
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,000
so uh so get a tool to that does this

659
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,740
routing send uh send all that stuff

660
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,000
somewhere else

661
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,700
uh begin your migration if you haven't

662
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,039
already to cloud-based sock tools I beat

663
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,080
on this horse on the last slide so start

664
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,120
the migration that you planned in Phase

665
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,940
One or continue it if you had already

666
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,340
started that

667
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:20,039
uh begin using machine learning to

668
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,679
analyze large data sets start simple and

669
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:25,620
build on that right this is uh this you

670
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,720
know and to do it well doesn't mean you

671
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,059
just go in and turn on all of the

672
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,760
algorithms it means understanding which

673
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,779
algorithm applies to you and your

674
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,539
environment and start turning those on

675
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,380
and or building your own and just moving

676
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,840
slowly through that process right this

677
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,820
is not sort of like remember you know a

678
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,740
lot of people when we first got Sims we

679
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,299
just turned on all the default rules

680
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,220
this is we should have learned this

681
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,799
lesson we don't do that

682
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,179
um unfortunately we still find places

683
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,820
that do this don't do that spend the

684
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,799
time analyze it I get it there's a lot

685
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,679
of stuff you have to do and doing uh

686
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,960
customized focused

687
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,440
um review of these things takes time I

688
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,320
get it but it's time well spent because

689
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,200
the end result is higher fidelity

690
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,860
results higher Fidelity alerts and

691
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,480
speaking of which going back to point

692
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,760
number the first point here the routing

693
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,679
and filtering logs that means you have

694
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
to spend time looking at the data you're

695
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,520
coming that you're collecting and

696
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,100
deciding whether it actually should come

697
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,340
into your security tool or not or and if

698
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,200
it comes in do you need all of the

699
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,500
fields I was at a low I was at a client

700
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,559
recently that was pulling in Cloud AWS

701
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,659
cloudtrail logs and they were just

702
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,299
pulling in the the all the fields

703
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,940
there's like 50 fields per event stop

704
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,860
you don't need 50 fields to do security

705
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,820
you maybe need 20 or maybe 10. the rest

706
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,279
of them send to the data Lake

707
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,940
okay so but that takes time to look and

708
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,919
analyze what's in those fields I get it

709
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,600
that's a lot because and you're running

710
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,520
around with like a one-legged man and a

711
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,340
butt kicking contest you're busy I get

712
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,520
it but spend 30 minutes a week 30 or an

713
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,220
hour a week doing this and over time you

714
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,440
will make progress okay you're not going

715
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
to do this all at once you're gonna just

716
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,640
just take you know like eating an

717
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,679
elephant an elephant one bite at a time

718
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,899
all right so take the time

719
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:29,640
um all right moving on to my next

720
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,020
soapbox

721
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,179
um I have a lot of them but um start

722
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,120
using uba and RBA all right stop you

723
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,520
know where you're building alerts based

724
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,240
on uh a series of behavior not just

725
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,059
Atomic actions right not just singular

726
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,520
action so you're getting you're going to

727
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,080
get higher Fidelity alerts because

728
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
you're not just saying if this alert if

729
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
this thing happens then send me an alert

730
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,779
and now I gotta go figure out if

731
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,520
everything else that happened around it

732
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,559
uh means that this thing that happened

733
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,659
was bad right now you're building like

734
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,640
if I see this and this in this time

735
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,880
frame with this person from this site

736
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,440
um you know and he's done it four times

737
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,600
then send an alert okay that's a much

738
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,940
better alert than just hey someone

739
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,620
logged in at 2am

740
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,380
okay so

741
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,240
um you know and now you have to figure

742
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,580
out well did they log in on purpose what

743
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,320
not you know so you know so spend the

744
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,600
time build this out

745
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,899
uh start building your security focused

746
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,539
on identity and data

747
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,840
use the metrics that you started in the

748
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,940
phrase one start keep using that metrics

749
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,700
to drive uh and also to evaluate the

750
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,799
effective effectiveness of your tools

751
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,899
guess what you may find out as you're

752
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,340
going through this that your tools

753
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,020
aren't very good

754
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,980
or they're redundant so get rid of them

755
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,840
oh my gosh you don't know how long it

756
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,940
took to us to deploy that tool yeah I do

757
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,760
I was part of DOD when we rolled out

758
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,940
hbss I get it and you know and you

759
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,380
wonder why it's still there because it

760
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,440
sucks to remove but you know what if if

761
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,779
not you know not talking about hbss but

762
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:09,539
if the tool in your organization you

763
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,880
determine wow we're we don't need it's

764
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,620
not very effective and we're using this

765
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,260
one much better than that one then go

766
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,140
rip it out yeah spend whatever amount of

767
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,179
hours it's going to take to rip it out

768
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,000
but the end result is better protection

769
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,100
and more efficient then it's worth the

770
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,860
effort and start using AI to explore

771
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,600
appropriate tasks I'm thinking you know

772
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,000
I don't understand I have to confess I'm

773
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,059
not you know a big chat BT GPT

774
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,080
um uh fan but just like every technology

775
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,419
this is only going to get better so five

776
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,100
years from now it's going to be better

777
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,620
and so what do you what can you use it

778
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,299
for can you use it to help write rules

779
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,640
can use it to help threat hunt can you

780
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,159
use it to do simple automated response

781
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,919
right how can you use this this tool

782
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,740
because it's a tool

783
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,480
um how can you use it to in this

784
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,360
environment so explore that figure that

785
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,860
out I don't have anything specific

786
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,419
that's five years from now maybe that

787
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,039
it'll by then it'll be different all

788
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,200
right so phase three all right so this

789
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,940
is where we're coming in uh we're coming

790
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,440
in for the landing right we're getting

791
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,000
to the point where we're getting to that

792
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,399
next-gen stock so at this point you

793
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,039
should have completed your migration to

794
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,080
the cloud you should have all of your

795
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
data storage all of your analytic

796
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,399
analytical capability all of your

797
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,440
compute everything should be in the

798
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,659
cloud all your remediation so it should

799
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,779
be reaching back into any on-prem places

800
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,299
that you have uh and doing remediation

801
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,840
so all of that should be there you um

802
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,480
and so that you're taking advantage of

803
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,700
the scalable costs and the K and the

804
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,279
scalable storage there you have a

805
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,039
detection engineering devsec Ops process

806
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:53,640
in place okay you are writing rules and

807
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,700
uh writing Automation and writings uh

808
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,620
and building and updating and tuning

809
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,559
this stuff on a regular

810
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,140
um repeatable consistent basis that

811
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,299
happens multiple times excuse me

812
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,780
multiple times a day so uh this process

813
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,760
is in place and so you are able at this

814
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,540
point to keep up with Ops okay and their

815
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,820
deployments this is the goal do you want

816
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,820
to be you want to be pacing Ops like

817
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,639
half a step behind if not in front of

818
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,679
Ops but you need to you know get to that

819
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,540
point

820
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,379
organize your teams out of Tears they

821
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,379
should be in uh in built on skill sets

822
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,619
this is going to do so much uh for our

823
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,719
ability it's going to help our uh it's

824
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,339
going to help our hiring because we're

825
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,960
going to be able to hire Junior people

826
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
entry-level people they're going to

827
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,080
enter into an environment where they can

828
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,300
learn and grow they're not expected to

829
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,359
know everything right away and so we can

830
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,060
train them we can build them up and they

831
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,219
can decide as they get uh more and more

832
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,020
seniors they move from entry to Junior

833
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,440
to Mid to senior do they want to be a

834
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,240
threat Hunter do they want to be an

835
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,520
incident responder do they want to be an

836
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,520
a security engineer right we have that

837
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,800
they can they're going to stay if you

838
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,240
have that environment where you bring

839
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,980
them on and raise them up and train them

840
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,320
up uh because and they're going to have

841
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,960
the OJT and the support system to do

842
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,359
that but that only happens if you have

843
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,140
the I mean teams and not in tears

844
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,460
because in tears you say well I don't

845
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,020
have any space in my tier two and

846
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,640
they're going to go welcome going to go

847
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,560
somewhere else that has a open position

848
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,200
at tier two but if you have if you're

849
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,180
just like well now I'm no longer Junior

850
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm a mid-person analyst and boom that's

851
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,119
what you are you're not like oh I'm tier

852
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,220
two you're just a mids analyst and then

853
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,540
I'm going to be a threat Hunter okay

854
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,160
you're still on the same team

855
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,440
and now you're at that Hunter you don't

856
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,660
have to be worried about like oh I need

857
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,339
this position right

858
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,240
uh partner with an MSP or MDR to cover

859
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,000
gaps I get it you know not all

860
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,900
organizations can or want to do all the

861
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,260
things or do it all the time so make

862
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,140
that decision partner with somebody uh

863
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,579
where you're going to Outsource and how

864
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,140
are you going to Outsource

865
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,200
uh and then as I you know tying back

866
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,540
into the teams concept you want to

867
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,339
develop fund and Implement a

868
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,619
comprehensive training program now I'm

869
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,320
not saying go out and hire teachers I'm

870
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,859
saying at a minimum build an Excel

871
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,359
spreadsheet that has hey here's all the

872
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,500
videos to go and watch on YouTube or the

873
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,960
internet to be a threat Hunter and these

874
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,940
are you know this is you know go watch

875
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,060
these go read these blogs and then go do

876
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,060
it oh by the way here are some VMS that

877
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,859
you can download and install and learn

878
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,540
how to threat hunt

879
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,599
that's your training program it costs

880
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,460
you nothing

881
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,320
okay

882
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,420
um you have a and you give that

883
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,160
spreadsheet to somebody and they check

884
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,020
off each item as they do them and they

885
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,599
hand it back and you say good job here's

886
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,880
your next spreadsheet go learn how to be

887
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,400
an incident responder watch these videos

888
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,880
read these blogs hear some VMS check

889
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,700
them off and give them back to me right

890
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,339
now that's simple you can do that it's

891
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,099
free you can also you know get a company

892
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,920
subscription to like udemy or cybrary or

893
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,680
you know name your platform of choice or

894
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,839
you could you know have you know go and

895
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,180
hire you know Black Hills to come in and

896
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,339
give you know on on-site training

897
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,980
whatever your flavor is but build that

898
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,640
have that in-house right so that you

899
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,400
have the capability to hire some entry

900
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,200
level guy

901
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,599
um and train them up and I'm going to

902
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,540
steal understudies comment when we were

903
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,760
having this conversation last night by

904
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,460
the way entry level and security is not

905
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,880
necessarily an entry level in entry

906
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,000
level position right you have to come in

907
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,280
as Security even as entry level with

908
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,140
some basic knowledge

909
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,760
um and if and so we have to kind of

910
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,079
change that and that's a whole nother

911
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,660
story of a whole nother lecture so

912
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,380
um

913
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,339
but that's uh tier three so wrapping up

914
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,859
here how do you get there so some

915
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:21,300
strategies first of all start with what

916
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,099
you have okay let's just you're not

917
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,359
going to rip and replace you're not

918
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,980
going to just throw out what you the you

919
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,180
know everything out that you're doing so

920
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,119
start with what you have uh increase the

921
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,400
use of managed Services if you to cover

922
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,820
gaps uh where you need so but you can

923
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,099
pull those back in house later that's

924
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,140
fine you need to do is like hey we need

925
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,839
you for a year we um my company has a

926
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,880
managed service and there are plenty of

927
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,380
places that say we need you for six

928
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,320
months and then at that point we'll have

929
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,359
the in-house stuff back and that's it

930
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,280
and that's the contract

931
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,680
we go in we cover them for six months

932
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,119
and then we hand it over to their

933
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,700
in-house people boom done that's that's

934
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,839
awesome

935
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,359
those are cool all right so you can do

936
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,500
that

937
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,040
um

938
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm not bothered but I'm not you know

939
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,960
but that's fine simplify the tools

940
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,400
talked about the number of tools that

941
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,619
you have right it's possibly 63 so

942
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,760
figure out which ones you don't need

943
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,200
take them out make yourselves more

944
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,960
efficient simplify the you know take

945
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,900
that that stress out increase at the

946
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,460
same time increase the amount of tools

947
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,900
that have good integration with each

948
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,180
other okay figure out where that is

949
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,500
right

950
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,940
um make that happen

951
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,140
higher develop higher and develop

952
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,920
internally you know externally skills

953
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,480
that you need coming up Cloud

954
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,760
programming devops data analytics skills

955
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,020
all of those are going to be crucial

956
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,720
skills that we need to have okay going

957
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,540
forward uh formalize your secops process

958
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,380
begin your zero trust Journey okay

959
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,160
um so some conclusions

960
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,700
uh as I come in here just wrapping up so

961
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,700
no two socks will look alike okay

962
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,619
um there's a lot of stuff here and some

963
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:05,520
of you are probably going we're not

964
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,900
doing all that we can't afford that I

965
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,820
get it okay I've worked for small

966
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,980
companies pretty much my entire life I

967
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,980
get that uh that's why I say figure out

968
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,560
what is applicable and what you can do

969
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,020
and how you can do it because the end of

970
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,480
the day what you want is you want a sock

971
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,640
that is capable has the capabilities I

972
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,040
talked about at the beginning right and

973
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,680
not everybody is going to be able to do

974
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,460
all of the steps but there are ways that

975
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,280
you can uh you know achieve those goals

976
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,920
without uh spending millions or billions

977
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,160
of dollars so Implement uh and and

978
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,140
continue automation efforts that's going

979
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,000
to help

980
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,640
uh consume tailored Brett and tell we

981
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,800
talked about that don't consume

982
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,020
Australian Public School threat and tell

983
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,300
models if unless you are Australian

984
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,000
Public Schools shift your operations to

985
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,940
the cloud start protecting identity and

986
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,040
data instead of devices

987
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,200
shift change your thinking it's too easy

988
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,839
that's even in my head I have to change

989
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,300
what I say change how I think change how

990
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,440
I plan

991
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,660
increase the Telemetry that you're

992
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,520
ingesting

993
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,740
develop machine learning and data

994
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,839
analytic capabilities plan for uh cicd

995
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,780
detection engineering basically devsec

996
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,579
opts the heck out of your detection and

997
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,220
monitoring and automation use short and

998
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,560
learn long-term planning okay this again

999
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,200
this is not an overnight thing you are

1000
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,119
going to need to plan this out over time

1001
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,240
and that uh short and long-term planning

1002
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,000
allows you to change Midstream okay I

1003
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,280
get it you know five two years from now

1004
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,839
the landscape could be completely

1005
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,660
different right four years ago who was

1006
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,579
planning on covid

1007
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,820
nobody that shifted everything so change

1008
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,320
your plans right things are going to

1009
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,640
happen

1010
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,920
so with that

1011
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,440
um I'll take any questions I will say

1012
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,700
that um

1013
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,980
so uh let me I'm going to come back to

1014
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,780
the slide in a minute

1015
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,940
um here are some references the top

1016
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,400
references is a paper I wrote on this

1017
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,440
it's about uh probably this point about

1018
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,320
a year old so this talk is updated but

1019
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,300
if you want that paper you can go to

1020
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,040
that website guidepoint security

1021
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,680
resources sock the Next Generation you

1022
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,420
will have to give up blood samples I

1023
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,500
mean uh some data to get it but

1024
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,660
um and I do say thank you to my company

1025
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,720
for allowing me to use their logo and

1026
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,960
their uh their formula on this uh on

1027
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,540
this talk but uh feel free to reach out

1028
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,119
to me and with that I have a few minutes

1029
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,599
for questions

1030
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,640
[Applause]

1031
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,660
thank you uh in the back

1032
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,200
uh yeah so the question is where would I

1033
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,839
put msps like malware sharing platforms

1034
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,240
I think you like like misp

1035
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,859
um I would put that under thread Intel

1036
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,440
absolutely uh you know if you if you are

1037
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,020
managing and running your own as opposed

1038
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,599
to subscribing to

1039
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,819
um anomaly or some such company

1040
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,760
yes sir

1041
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,460
so I don't have 50 minutes for another

1042
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,859
oh so let me let me back up so the

1043
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:39,720
question is if we're going if you're

1044
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,640
going to Outsource your sock what are

1045
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,140
some good questions to make sure that

1046
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,839
you have reliable uh vendor to do it

1047
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,819
that's a good summary of it and I my

1048
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,619
answer initial answer to that is I don't

1049
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,260
have 50 minutes for another talk

1050
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,300
um but I would absolutely talk about

1051
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,540
what their processes are uh how they

1052
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,020
take feedback how they verify that they

1053
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,599
are monitoring everything and how they

1054
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,980
uh

1055
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,200
um how you can communicate to them what

1056
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,720
your critical data identities and

1057
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,880
devices and processes are so they know

1058
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,700
what to prioritize

1059
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,540
yes ma'am

1060
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,579
I personally am not but I'm a little bit

1061
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,200
biased because I've had people say hey

1062
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,060
let's look over this Python program I

1063
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,160
wrote with chappie ghbt and I have to

1064
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,760
spend like an hour debugging it so

1065
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,119
um there is definitely talk about that

1066
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,060
about chat about Ai and things like the

1067
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,700
chat the gpts and the berts

1068
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,640
um changing threat but I think at the

1069
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,880
end of the day that most of you know

1070
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,740
when you look at what exploits come out

1071
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,079
and vulnerabilities are found in

1072
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,300
exploits I'm sorry and vulnerabilities

1073
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,140
found a lot of that is human intuition

1074
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,819
of looking at something and going oh

1075
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,740
that's funny I wonder why that does that

1076
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,319
right and sometimes and that's not

1077
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,079
something that you know I think

1078
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,180
I think you may see commodity stuff come

1079
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,260
out of it but I don't think you're going

1080
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,700
to see the really advanced stuff that's

1081
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,598
my personal opinion

1082
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,700
any other questions

1083
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,760
yes ma'am

1084
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,500
say again I didn't hear you

1085
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,540
exactly

1086
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,578
because

1087
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,640
right so the question was uh I had said

1088
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,680
earlier that there's often conflict

1089
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,359
between compliance and best practices

1090
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,240
and insurance companies sometimes ask

1091
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,240
you to do best practices and so what you

1092
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,859
know one of my thoughts on that is that

1093
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,200
a good summary so

1094
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,859
a lot of times compliance tries to say

1095
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,980
you know comply with best practices and

1096
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,480
maybe points to something like nist 853

1097
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,000
or some ISO model or something like that

1098
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,339
and and in that case sometimes that's

1099
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,099
that those are the same but at the same

1100
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,560
time we have to remember that sometimes

1101
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,200
best practices are just

1102
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,280
um aren't necessarily enough and that a

1103
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,619
compliance standard doesn't always match

1104
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,060
that and so a best practice Can can not

1105
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,280
only be an implementation but an

1106
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,680
understanding of the environment in

1107
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,800
which that implementation occurs and so

1108
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,040
there there's still that um there's

1109
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,020
still that that sometimes uh difference

1110
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,060
and you have to figure out how to to

1111
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,460
cover that difference cover that gap

1112
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,960
between what I can expect and you know

1113
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,000
what should be done a good example is

1114
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,359
PCI right so PCI has compliance and

1115
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,180
compliance is based on best practices

1116
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,680
you would think but there's still that

1117
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,700
gap between their and effective security

1118
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,099
does that answer your question

1119
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,020
awesome

1120
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,560
yes

1121
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,900
so the question is I as I said I talked

1122
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,240
about shifting strategy from protecting

1123
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,920
devices to protecting identities and

1124
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,200
data and so what are some thoughts on

1125
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,960
tools or capabilities that you know you

1126
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,359
would employ to do that and especially

1127
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:49,500
in the difference between structured and

1128
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,319
unstructured data is that a fair summary

1129
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,140
excellent so

1130
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,700
wow

1131
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,980
um I think that just talking about the

1132
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,800
overall change in your strategy I think

1133
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,540
when you talk about the protecting

1134
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,000
devices that that's very much like I

1135
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,339
have a physical thing and I can easily

1136
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:09,839
control what goes in and out of that

1137
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,720
thing even if that thing is an instance

1138
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,260
in uh the cloud as like ec2 or Azure or

1139
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,540
such it's a thing and I can control what

1140
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,480
goes in and out as opposed to data which

1141
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,760
can be anywhere and moves often right

1142
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,800
I'm not going in and I'm not picking up

1143
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,480
a server and moving it from you know

1144
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,400
from this data center to that data

1145
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,800
center or I'm not moving an ec2 instance

1146
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,920
from you know from from Zone from this

1147
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,599
availability Zone to that availability

1148
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:37,740
Zone

1149
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,660
um so but data can shift all the time it

1150
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,339
can have multiple copies

1151
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,560
um same with identities that can be just

1152
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,359
anywhere at any time moving through

1153
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,700
places and so what you end up doing is

1154
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,500
you start looking for tools that are

1155
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
able to uh identify that stuff and we're

1156
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,099
not some tools can do that sort but you

1157
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,960
know but I think those tools are still

1158
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,880
very much at the beginning we're still

1159
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,800
trying to figure out how to

1160
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,000
um these tools are still trying to

1161
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,859
figure out you know the best way to

1162
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,440
track this data and keep keep track of

1163
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,800
it and and control access to it as well

1164
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,960
as trying to manage our identities and

1165
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,240
because every uh the challenge with

1166
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,800
identities is that everything you

1167
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,359
connect to

1168
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,760
uh has a different way of identifying

1169
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,940
you even if you have SSO all SSO is a

1170
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,520
front end to everything you're accessing

1171
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,800
and so everything you're accessing has

1172
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,599
an identity all you do is they have one

1173
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,940
reference to many things and so it's

1174
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,099
very nebulous I think we haven't we're

1175
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:37,440
not there yet we're starting to but for

1176
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,060
those of you who have worked and trying

1177
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,700
to build actual identity and data

1178
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,500
protection especially if you're doing

1179
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,020
any kind of zero trust engineering you

1180
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,060
realize this is hard

1181
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,740
um and it's hard tracking it hard

1182
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,920
matching it and it's hard uh you know uh

1183
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,619
it's hard protecting it

1184
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,420
um and I think we have a lot a long way

1185
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,980
to go with that

1186
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,900
um there are some tools out there I mean

1187
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,339
I'm not going to talk about them because

1188
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:03,960
we sell some of them

1189
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,220
um but

1190
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,900
um some are better than others but we're

1191
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,060
we're we're we're we're ways yet from

1192
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,740
there does that answer a question

1193
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,380
or at least give you you know some warm

1194
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,740
fuzzies

1195
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,280
all right awesome

1196
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,000
anyone else

1197

awesome well thanks for coming out to my

talk I'll be around as I said uh you

1199
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,220
know I'm reachable on on the interwebs

1200
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,560
and uh thanks for appreciate all your

1201
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,500
