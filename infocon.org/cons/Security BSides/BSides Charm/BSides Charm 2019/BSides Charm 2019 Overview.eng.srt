00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:38,299
responsibility to have and then in

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,520
January of doing a little background

35
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,799

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,060
were streaming over YouTube maybe some

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,060

41
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,220
in 2013 we turned an old close down the

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,390
rec center into a Tech Center so the

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,950
space actually looks a lot different

44
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,809
than this it changes around from

45
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,980
semester to semester but we're

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,690
definitely interested in sort of like

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,510
taking the knowledge that we have gained

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,120
in sort of imparting it on other sort of

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,859
rec centers other educators to bring

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,319
back as opposed to expanding our

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,380
physical footprint so we're working with

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,810

thanks for interviewing um so tell me

84
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:58,380
what is magic all about headquartered in

85
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,180
Westminster Maryland in Carroll County

86
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,900
our whole mission is to create a tech

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,630
ecosystem that so we nurture we try to

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,179
inspire talent entrepreneurs and tech

89
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,800
businesses and specifically the reason

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,539
that we come to this event is because we

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,000
put on an entry-level capture-the-flag

92
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:18,550
cyber security competition two times a

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,130
year so middle school high school

94
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,690
college students non-traditional

95
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,260
students can all participate in this

96
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,440
event

97
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,200
and we usually have anywhere from 100 to

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,050
150 different students participating

99
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,360
from around the world so our last event

100
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,450
was in April and we had 8 different

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,160
locations so we played in Westminster at

102
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,229
two locations there were multiple

103
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,870
libraries in Maryland that participated

104
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:46,270
and then we had locations a school and

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:50,920
in Quito Ecuador and two schools in

106
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,990
Estonia that participated as well and so

107
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,370
we're always looking for young talent to

108
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,620
participate in these events but then

109
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,540
we're also looking for tech

110
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,000
professionals to help out as volunteers

111
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,000
and as coaches and mentors for the day

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,040
of the event and so we come to these

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,740
sides because you guys understand what

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:17,500
we do I don't finish much I see you got
