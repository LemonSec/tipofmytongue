1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,600
okay Google please play Rick Astley

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,080
never going to give you up hey Siri

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,389
please played never gonna give you up

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,580
well there we go that's some things are

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,939
more secure than they seem and welcome

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,039
to the day - Keith keynote for besides

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,330
Baltimore and today I'm going to do a

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,210
talk that's quite a bit different from

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,009
the ones that I usually do I look around

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,340
the room and I actually have had about

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,170
30 or 50 of you in my classes before and

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
you know that I spend a lot of time

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,410
working on large-scale network

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,450
monitoring but I really wanted to use

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,309
this as an opportunity to kind of look

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,020
forward and before I do that let me

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,760
start with a quick disclaimer and that's

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,410
that the opinions expressed today are

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,059
solely my own and do not reflect the

20
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,989
views of anyone else especially my

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,620
employer so Who am I so my name is Liam

22
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:56,519
Randall I've been in tech for over 20

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,968
years I got my start at a university and

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,460
I very quickly was called towards

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,040
security I'm probably most well known

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,960
for taking a little language out of

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,990
Berkeley that used to be called bro

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,970
to market but I've also was the seed

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,570
investor on OS query for familiar with

30
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,369
that out of Facebook I've recently sold

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,939
a couple years ago I sold critical stack

32
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,250
to Capital One and I sort of work now as

33
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,169
an angel investor and I run an

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,150
innovation portfolio for Capital One

35
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,579
Bank which I love it's a phenomenal

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,799
place we're hiring all the time if

37
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,470
you're interested talk to Katie or

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,840
myself afterwards I'm a husband and the

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,900
dad and I wanted to talk really quick

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,110
about my own personal journey because it

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,670
gives me some insight into some of the

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,079
frustrations I think that many of you

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,119
feel if you've been in security for a

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,779
while and I got my start back in the mid

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,939
90s

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,159
working for a large university actually

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,500
at mid-sized University Xavier as a

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,659
network administrator at about 6,500

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,460
hosts and I learned some really critical

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,140
lessons early in my career and that's

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,479
that I could never visit every single

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,880
workstation so I started writing my own

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,920
tools that ran in our Novell 3-1 to

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,780
logon scripts to do network monitoring

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,409
and some of my first challenges were

56
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,299
migrating to tcp/ip from IPX SPX

57
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:17,189
from there I went on and I started to

58
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,079
get into product development am I one of

59
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:20,670
my first products I ended up doing

60
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,459
around a hundred fifty million on a

61
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,369
recurring basis annually that was around

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,310
the turn of the century and from there I

63
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,400
went into large-scale network monitoring

64
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,930
and this is where I sort of met most of

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,459
the people in this space and I had the

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,620
opportunity to work with hundreds of

67
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,939
other companies many of the Internet

68
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,129
majors over half the fortune 100 and and

69
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,108
pretty much for about ten years I just

70
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,090
tapped all the things you know I went

71
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:51,870
around and I got to see these patterns

72
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,030
of failure across a huge variety of

73
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,299
organizations and that's what is really

74
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,699
driven the sort of most recent stages of

75
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,760
my career and that's in moving into the

76
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:06,269
product ization of security into a

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,120
declarative surgery security and for me

78
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,469
this really came to me like a calling

79
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
and that's a strange word to use at a

80
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,730
technical conference because we're

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,189
calling is usually reserved for you know

82
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,698
religion but for a lot of the people

83
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:23,250
here on a Sunday morning no less on the

84
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,810
weekend you're not here because your

85
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,519
employer wants you to be you're here

86
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,620
because you love it and that's that

87
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,349
passion that drives us forward is going

88
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,180
to be our only hope to sort of get out

89
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,488
of this you know passion is this great

90
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,259
precursor to expertise it's the passion

91
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,239
to stick with it even when it's Sunday

92
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,339
morning when you stay with it and you go

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,120
from there

94
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:46,259
so before we move through the agenda I'm

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,579
gonna do a quick little state of

96
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,500
security I'm not going to spend a lot of

97
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,120
time there because we all know what the

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,250
current state of security still is and

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,919
it's the exact same state that was in 20

100
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,329
years ago I'm gonna talk about what I

101
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,159
think's the most important thing which

102
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,069
is the changing landscape and the

103
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,668
opportunities in the changing landscape

104
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:08,819
then I'm gonna do a demonstration on a

105
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:10,919
timeless technique web shell when it

106
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,198
meets the sort of declarative future and

107
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,079
then finally I'm gonna do a call to

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,759
action and try to inspire you guys on to

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,108
what are some of the low-hanging fruits

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
and opportunities that you should be

111
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,229
taking your career so at this point I

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,160
assume that the state of security is a

113
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,380
completely self-evident

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,630
that's that on a lot of levels words

115
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,659
that it complete another failure

116
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,659
there is you know the strategy of

117
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,580
protection is helpful but only when

118
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,740
paired with rapid detection and most of

119
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,359
my talks if you go on YouTube or if you

120
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,730
come to one of the network monitoring

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,890
classes that I teach you know I'm

122
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,430
teaching you how to deploy NSM you know

123
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,950
bro she ricotta a stenographer or at

124
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,630
MOOC on epilogue we did a talk about our

125
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,200
new endpoint security monitoring which

126
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,370
is OS query plus sis Mon plus elastic

127
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,430
search and running these things at

128
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,040
large-scale but the ultimate TLDR is is

129
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,910
that in today's infrastructure it's

130
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,830
incredibly hard

131
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,630
it's bespoke and it's relatively

132
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,520
expensive and that's that's a general

133
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,070
word you know I think you can do it a

134
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,020
lot better yourself with open-source

135
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:23,170
than with stacks of commercial products

136
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:27,070
but ultimately we're just not at a good

137
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:29,470
place and we can't solve today's

138
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,210
problems with the same level of thinking

139
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,340
we used when we created them and that's

140
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,010
the old Albert Einstein adage for the

141
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,960
blue team but it's especially hard

142
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,460
because if when I would go from large

143
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,370
organization to a larger organization

144
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,049
bad is a matter of policy because what

145
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,510
you accept in your environment what you

146
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,419
do in your environment is all bespoke so

147
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,909
the portability of things like AI models

148
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,130
and ml models I'm very skeptical that

149
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,620
many of those models are going to be

150
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,360
highly portable because there are things

151
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,430
that are normal in one network and

152
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,680
network aid that are completely abnormal

153
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,290
and would be a red alarm a fire in

154
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,650
another network so I do spend a lot of

155
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:12,100
time working and developing AI nml using

156
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,159
bro and chi ricotta and os query and

157
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,840
system on data but I think that there is

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,580
a precursor step that we should be

159
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,409
taking before we move there and that's

160
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,270
that declarative future now I'm going to

161
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,370
come back to this one but ultimately

162
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,409
this this technology problem is compound

163
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,000
compounded by people problem and it's

164
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,230
that users are the weakest link and

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
there are some reasons for that that

166
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,160
we'll review and more but we've all got

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,289
limited working memory when we're

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,780
looking for information or reading blogs

169
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,849
we scan we don't actually read and

170
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,650
consume we look for trigger words like

171
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,090
our names

172
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,760
some of the things that trigger the

173
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,799
reptilian brain and it's not that people

174
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,690
are lazy they're just concerned with

175
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,600
making progress in their lives and they

176
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:55,870
are a little lazy they're also social

177
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,310
and at a deeper level many of our

178
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,110
decisions are unconscious and can be

179
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,910
easily manipulated and I think that

180
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,860
there's obviously a crisis in social

181
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,410
media with manipulation at the moment

182
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,730
but that's also an opportunity and we're

183
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,150
actually going to dive into that a

184
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,260
little bit so let's talk about the

185
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,140
declarative future and what that

186
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,630
actually means so when we're looking at

187
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,310
you know look across the last 30 40

188
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,740
years of infrastructure there are these

189
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,440
big computing epics that were sort of

190
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,870
rolling through and many of us started

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,280
our career back in the full PC days you

192
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,560
know when you would actually speck out

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,809
the raid array and you know you would be

194
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,430
bounded by a single machine and we treat

195
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,810
these machines like they're your pets

196
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,760
and you would love them and care for

197
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,220
them and if they got sick you know you

198
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,570
would feed them and try to fix them and

199
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,670
they were important to you you know

200
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,099
sequel oh one was a precious little

201
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,820
asset and his little brother sequel to

202
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,980
was the sort of next generation and when

203
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,760
virtualization came along it was a big

204
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,470
step and we start to see this trend of

205
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,270
giving developers and application

206
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,610
delivery teams less and less

207
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,680
responsibility and having a greater

208
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,030
shared surface if you look at that sort

209
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,130
of chart there you see the straight line

210
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,539
going across and even though virtual

211
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,030
machines have been out for a long time

212
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,220
that's still mostly how people use the

213
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,590
cloud most people just think of the

214
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,840
cloud as you know big virtual machine

215
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,150
store where I can rent servers and

216
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,669
that's their model now there's been a

217
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,500
big paradigm shift with containerization

218
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,630
and what most people haven't

219
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,430
ultimately considered is is that when

220
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,500
we're moving to these containerized

221
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,630
solutions with things like docker you're

222
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,990
not just moving the security boundary

223
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,939
from the CPU to the Linux kernel you're

224
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,219
also moving the networking boundary and

225
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,590
that's a that's a radical shift with

226
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,820
what we've been doing in security and

227
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,190
that's going to continue to drive things

228
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,140
forward now serverless is a great idea

229
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,490
because if you think about it it's even

230
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,890
less things that the developers need to

231
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,900
be responsible for I'm of the mind right

232
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,310
now that serverless and containerization

233
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,199
are essentially being smashed together

234
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,430
if you're familiar with what kubernetes

235
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,229
brings to the table I'm not going to

236
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,638
talk a lot about kubernetes but I will

237
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,300
actually use it in some of my demos

238
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,250
today the sort of weakness for server

239
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,430
list has been that it's not portable but

240
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,220
with the rise of kubernetes frameworks

241
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,949
like cañedo or even the native server

242
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,569
list project or some of the other CN CF

243
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,849
projects the cloud native computing

244
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,649
foundation we now have portable server

245
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,339
lists so we're seeing this trend where

246
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:25,269
if the infrastructure we're bringing the

247
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,740
responsibility up here and this is

248
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:30,759
moving us towards a more declarative

249
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,699
model now in these declarative models

250
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,430
you sort of the dream is is that you can

251
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:38,109
simply just leverage the capability you

252
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,420
define the end state you say hey here's

253
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,980
my container just run this and if you're

254
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,469
familiar with some of these vendors here

255
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,240
the less declarative models are the ones

256
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,519
where you need to explicitly tell them

257
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,350
how you want them to work so on the far

258
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,899
left side of the screen DevOps is cane

259
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,540
and on the far left there's sort of a

260
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,899
decline of DevOps it doesn't go away but

261
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,000
it certainly falls behind the veneer of

262
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,439
these declarative interfaces so if I'm a

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,079
team that's building the

264
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:06,490
containerization platform on kubernetes

265
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,670
or if I'm building the serverless

266
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,529
platform I have DevOps people co-located

267
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,269
with my team but you don't need the

268
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,559
DevOps people in order to build them and

269
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,529
that's a little bit of a shift from

270
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,870
where people have been building their

271
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,220
infrastructure now we'll look at what a

272
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,170
container is but these are these little

273
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,930
modular and isolated application

274
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,849
delivery items and they're coupled with

275
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,099
that shift again of moving the security

276
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,589
boundary from the CPU you know this

277
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,050
boundary of the the network think down

278
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,370
here on the on the left side that is

279
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,500
where almost all of your security

280
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,540
controls today work you know your common

281
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,000
security controls today aren't designed

282
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,849
to extract metadata and information from

283
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,250
inside the Linux kernel and that is a

284
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,569
huge opportunity on the product side you

285
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,759
know for sort of rebooting everything

286
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,769
that's out there but if we think about

287
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,069
where this trend starts to take us on

288
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,809
the technology side and we combine this

289
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:01,269
with a trend of what's happening on the

290
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,860
application side infrastructure in the

291
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,630
very near future it looks radically

292
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,819
different than it does today and this is

293
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,630
not an imagination if you're in large

294
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,150
enterprise or

295
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,560
now there's a breakneck switch that

296
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,720
reminds me of what happened when

297
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,300
virtualization was first introduced in

298
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,550
the into the ecosystem of people moving

299
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,310
to these technologies there's a huge

300
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,589
efficiency gains to be had from a higher

301
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,869
application density there's huge cost

302
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,420
savings to be had and there's huge

303
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,730
simplicity for the developers for the

304
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,020
application execution teams and so forth

305
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,070
so let's talk about these containers for

306
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,870
a quick minute and then we'll get into

307
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,750
some actual demos to make this a little

308
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,000
bit more interesting so when you're

309
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,540
comparing these kind of big ontology is

310
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,250
here

311
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,329
the weakness and server lists has

312
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,040
traditionally been that it wasn't

313
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,440
portable and I've just changed that to

314
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,030
red yesterday because now I feel like

315
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,750
with some of the frameworks that are out

316
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,040
there that is becoming portable but you

317
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,900
when you think about what is the attack

318
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,150
surface the attack surface is getting

319
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,010
smaller and smaller at least what the

320
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,020
attack surface that you as an

321
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,360
application developer responsible for if

322
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,600
you're running on virtual machines if

323
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,870
you're deploying into ec2 or some raw

324
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,950
compute resource then you're also need

325
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,510
to be concerned about the operating

326
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,640
system now maybe you have a team that

327
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,189
patches it but if you can raise yourself

328
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,810
up into the containerized world you can

329
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,120
leave behind as many of these things as

330
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,400
possible and you can execute in a world

331
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,190
with a minimal attack surface that's

332
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,949
what that trendline is really going

333
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,750
there now if you just real quick by show

334
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,890
of hands who's using containers today

335
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,020
and production a lower number that I

336
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,350
would then I would see at cloud events

337
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,640
at a at a reinvent obviously that would

338
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,260
be a place where you would find lots of

339
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,630
cloud people but I think that's a big

340
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,010
opportunity and security itself when

341
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,020
you're building these containers they

342
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,360
essentially come as layers so think of

343
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,760
it like a cake right you can start with

344
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,260
an underlying piece of cake like that

345
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,560
you could say from a boon to or you

346
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,960
could say from golang or you could say

347
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,969
from alpine or one of these container

348
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,920
issue one of these containers here and

349
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,290
you just add the minimal amount of

350
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,319
layers that you have there so on one

351
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,329
hand we have the infrastructure getting

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,670
smaller and smaller and on the other

353
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,899
hand we have the applications that are

354
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,878
getting smaller and smaller and what

355
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,759
like to show you is is what happens when

356
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,600
these two things meet the current sort

357
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,939
of state of the art in exploitation and

358
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,579
let's look at an example here we're

359
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:37,579
gonna use a web shell this is a timeless

360
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:41,989
and true tactic I will do a little intro

361
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:46,519
here about to sort of set the scene the

362
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:48,470
application team has the application

363
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,069
team has successfully deployed their

364
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,279
application and thus is ou can sleep at

365
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:56,839
night because always good in the world

366
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,490
and unfortunately there is a threat

367
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:03,050
actor that exists in the universe that

368
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:06,079
has decided that they want to get all of

369
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,149
your data so the company's happy because

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,888
they're saving lots of money they've

371
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,040
opened this portal on the web where

372
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:14,899
their customers can come 24/7 and sign

373
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,649
up for a new account or apply to join

374
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:21,369
their team or whatever the case would be

375
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:25,480
however they've also opened up some huge

376
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:28,189
exploits into their environment now this

377
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,740
technique it's unbelievable that this

378
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:33,498
technique is still as common as it is

379
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,790
but if you're reading a police

380
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:39,860
exploitation reports from any modern

381
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,498
incident it's still the same things and

382
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,499
these are if you're you know go back to

383
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:47,959
the 90s you know we're using web shells

384
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:51,259
you know back in the 90s right and this

385
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,239
technique still hasn't gone anywhere so

386
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,589
what we're gonna do is I'm first gonna

387
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,870
walk you through what a web show looks

388
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,269
like is I know not everybody spends all

389
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,309
day actually deploying these things or

390
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,459
responding to these things we're gonna

391
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:07,280
switch devices here so hopefully we

392
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:12,219
actually train back up on the video

393
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:16,069
[Music]

394
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:27,350
all right so let's see this trains back

395
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:29,450
up here signal tiny screen right okay

396
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,000
better all right so this is what a web

397
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,490
show looks like so typically a company

398
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,190
will you know this is the company here

399
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,620
over on the right side they're operating

400
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,470
you know this web page with a customer

401
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,060
count portal and in this case we'll say

402
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,850
that this is a health care company and

403
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,640
this is actually based on a real

404
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,700
incident that I helped respond to a few

405
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,100
years ago you may have read about it in

406
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,100
the news and what happens is is normally

407
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,720
a person can come in and they can sign

408
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,950
up for a new account and they can upload

409
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,410
their application to the to the company

410
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,150
right and you actually can fill out a

411
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,790
piece of paper if you want and you could

412
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,010
scan it in and the sort of developer

413
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,280
sort of checks and says hey you know is

414
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:21,260
this app you know is this end in you

415
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:25,610
know dot gif you know dot JPEG or dot

416
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:29,840
PNG right and what happens is is a

417
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:32,120
threat actor comes along and when you

418
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,250
think about advanced persistent threat

419
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,840
people oftentimes focus on the advanced

420
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,700
piece of this but I'll tell you that

421
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,410
it's typically the second piece it's the

422
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,140
persistent piece that comes into play

423
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,790
and I'll show you bro logs from this

424
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,720
incident here in just a moment but let

425
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,449
me walk you through what it actually

426
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,550
looks like so the threat actor visits

427
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,330
the webpage and let me change my pen to

428
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:56,750
red here okay and they first try to

429
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,730
upload a file called login ASP alright

430
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,830
and they put this up in your server and

431
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,600
the developer checks actually look at

432
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,350
this and they say I'm sorry this doesn't

433
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,270
end in dot PNG or JPEG or any of the

434
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,790
other things so I'm not going to accept

435
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,639
that file alright and they're sitting on

436
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,050
their health care portal here and the

437
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,930
web server actually then you know there

438
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,849
is a it doesn't throw an error here so

439
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,949
that the threat actor then uploads

440
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,569
another document and this one they

441
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:28,249
renamed to login

442
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:30,440
dot ASP semicolon dot gif now what

443
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:34,009
they're exploiting here is this is in

444
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,799
fact an ASP file but the web developer

445
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:38,600
is not doing mime type checking on this

446
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,489
particular application it's a common

447
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,779
flaw so not looking at the contents of

448
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,220
the file they're just looking at the

449
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,229
name of the file and assuming that the

450
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,859
two things line up here now in this case

451
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:52,549
the thread actor accidentally uploaded a

452
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:54,350
a web shell for the wrong version of ASP

453
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:58,039
so when you look at the logs you'll

454
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:01,488
start to see alerts firing here that hey

455
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:04,070
I've got a 500 this doesn't execute so

456
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:06,590
the threat actor continues to try web

457
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,960
shells almost as if they're just brute

458
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,879
forcing the problem here and eventually

459
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,249
they get one that actually lands after

460
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:17,330
switching to about a dozen so suddenly

461
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:19,460
they now have the ability to run you

462
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,799
know RCE full remote code execution on

463
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,359
your server here right this file their

464
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,119
files now sitting on your server and

465
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,999
they can then use this to start pulling

466
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:32,090
in their next couple stages so this is

467
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:34,220
you know PowerShell Empire this is mini

468
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,320
cats this is all the things they can do

469
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,539
it right through their web console here

470
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,340
and then they can pivot into you know

471
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,629
all the the GUI pieces of your network

472
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,619
back here where you don't want any

473
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:47,178
threat actors accessing your technology

474
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:49,428
so this is this is a really old

475
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:53,210
technique but it's still really really

476
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,369
current and it's shocking that we don't

477
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:01,039
have ways to mitigate this or we don't

478
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:03,109
seem to have ways to mitigate this let's

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,549
take a look at the bro logs for that and

480
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:11,059
I think you'll see a different

481
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:13,550
perspective something on the back when

482
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:19,889
we got signal trained up again

483
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:26,409
[Music]

484
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:28,900
all right excellent so on the network

485
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,000
side you know you see these post

486
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,400
requests up to the web shell here right

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,550
this one is actually called API dot ASP

488
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,900
gif but you can see the the internal

489
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,730
server errors where they were previously

490
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,180
trying to get to the the previous

491
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:47,170
version of the web shell so what does

492
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,820
this look like if we if we want to

493
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,200
emulate this and you guys can all if you

494
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,300
have a mobile device with you right now

495
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,070
you can pull out your phone and you can

496
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,450
emulate along with me so I published

497
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,649
this to the web here and what we're

498
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,050
gonna do is we're gonna spin up a quick

499
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,940
little web shell and this is a web shell

500
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,550
that is posted on my github and I've

501
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,500
already got it compiled and put it into

502
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,760
a docker container for you and all the

503
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,100
instructions are here if you'd like to

504
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,980
do that but the web shell is very simple

505
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,360
all right what we do is we just look for

506
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,940
anything that's passed to forge less

507
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,860
exact and we turn around and we execute

508
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,500
that against the operating system so if

509
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,500
I do exact question mark command equals

510
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,700
it'll just RCE that on the box so what

511
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,370
I've done is is I've just given you a

512
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,890
trivial way to just experiment with this

513
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,969
on your own time and then I took this

514
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:35,920
and I sort of wrapped it around I

515
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,330
wrapped this around a little gooey for

516
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,050
our example that we're gonna have here

517
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:43,600
and I've loaded this particular web

518
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,500
shell now into four different containers

519
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,809
for you to play with

520
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,429
all right the first is like treating a

521
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,710
container like a virtual machine all

522
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:53,260
right and it's a from go line container

523
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,820
and it's about eight hundred Meg then I

524
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,710
did it from a boon - which is a little

525
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,280
over 100 and then a minimal container

526
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,140
district called Alpine and then a the

527
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,059
preferred way which is from scratch and

528
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,370
when we're building things from scratch

529
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,870
this is where you start to have these

530
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,669
realizations when you're at security

531
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,280
about how truly far ahead some

532
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:15,250
organizations are in these paradigms now

533
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,670
if you're not familiar with what scratch

534
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,780
is it's following this trend of allowing

535
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,790
you to have a smaller and smaller

536
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,428
footprint but on the application side

537
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,960
and you can use this programming

538
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:28,240
language called go if you're familiar

539
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,900
with it to compile all of your

540
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,730
dependency

541
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,500
into your Byner so this is the only

542
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,600
thing you need to ship in your container

543
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,090
so there's nothing else that's sitting

544
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,919
in there and when you think about when I

545
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,559
had that realization that not only was

546
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,050
go designed ten years ago but it was

547
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:45,370
designed specifically for

548
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,409
containerization which had yet to sort

549
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,330
of rise to the forefront of technology

550
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,730
that it's in today you have one of those

551
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,350
moments that truly should be humbling in

552
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,059
your career when you think that there

553
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,889
are there are people out there that

554
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,420
really have a deep understanding of this

555
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,400
problem and are building the future

556
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,510
right and now we can leverage that

557
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,700
future in order to increase the strength

558
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,850
of our applications now what's

559
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,760
interesting is is that containerization

560
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,870
is not perfect and these tags that you

561
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,240
can throw in a container don't actually

562
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,100
mean anything you know so from latest is

563
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,770
just a tag that's thrown on a on a

564
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,629
container here and this chart is a

565
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,070
little old this scan was from a few

566
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,470
months ago when I when I first did this

567
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,629
demo but just out of the box

568
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,920
there were vulnerabilities baked into

569
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,200
these containers that had not been

570
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,970
patched yet all right just the update

571
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,580
frequency on what I pulled from docker

572
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,980
hub was not there but when I was

573
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,830
deploying on Alpine a minimal container

574
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,780
district with just a bare shim to run my

575
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,780
application or even better from scratch

576
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,670
I didn't have to worry about any of that

577
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,460
so what does this look like so if you

578
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,770
take out your mobile device or your

579
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,030
laptop and you can go to three different

580
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,129
versions of this right now

581
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,970
you can go to scratch that Liam Randall

582
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,690
comm and you can go to Fedora dot Liam

583
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:06,700
Randall comm and you can go to Alpine

584
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,500
Det Liam Randall comm and let's start on

585
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,870
the Fedora one here and you guys can't

586
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:16,720
see the top of my screen this around

587
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:19,389
there all right so this is person facts

588
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,370
this is a totally fake company that has

589
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,920
the best person facts it's smart

590
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,409
gorgeous and insanely fast and it's

591
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,410
available at all times and as I

592
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,920
mentioned person fax has inadvertently

593
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,090
deployed a web shell all right so I have

594
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,760
full RCE

595
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:40,480
into this environment right I could pull

596
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,840
down code I could pivot I could x Ville

597
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,600
I could do anything I want

598
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:51,139
let's do something let's go like cat and

599
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:55,279
then ampersand and then R equals a / @ze

600
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,169
password perfect okay all right I can do

601
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,710
all the things that my life is terrible

602
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:04,880
and I'm sad and I lost all my data

603
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,990
translate this page shall we not now

604
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,299
let's look at a slightly smaller

605
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,130
footprint right let's let's take this

606
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,230
right side of the equation and let's

607
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,710
take the application footprint down a

608
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:22,549
bit smaller here and we're going to exec

609
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:25,820
command equals LS all right I can look

610
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:31,490
at what's there and I could also do

611
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:37,220
something I can't let's see yep hard

612
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:39,409
equals and see a password whatever these

613
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,270
are up right now do your worst

614
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:43,070
all right play with all the things right

615
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,360
destroy it destroy all the boxes I'm

616
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,418
gonna nuke everything after this talk

617
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,219
anyway all right now let's look at a

618
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,169
different version of this let's look at

619
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,029
the from scratch now so when you think

620
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,220
about this logically think of a big

621
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,020
empty shipping container with just this

622
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,510
application in it there's nothing else

623
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:06,860
so even if I have full RCE on this box

624
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:11,390
what can I do command equals LS I don't

625
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:14,479
even have a LS right in fact the only

626
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,179
thing that I can try to do here is to

627
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,740
run my application again which doesn't

628
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,830
work because it's already bound to its

629
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,789
default port in the container so very

630
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,559
powerful but simple demo that shows

631
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,000
moving your applications towards this

632
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,389
declarative future these minimal

633
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,880
footprints and running them on these you

634
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,419
know large platforms can dramatically

635
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,010
increase your security posture by

636
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:42,260
decreasing your vulnerability footprint

637
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,559
but I think what's most interesting is

638
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,870
is if we take this particular this trend

639
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,940
and we start to follow it forward what

640
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,070
does the near future look like you know

641
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,230
just to show you the minimal OS example

642
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,280
there you know this is the from scratch

643
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,780
docker file

644
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,639
you know there's only four lines in it

645
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,480
from scratch and then I put in a

646
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,570
certificate

647
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,420
I added my my binary and then I set it

648
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:07,760
up to execute on start on the bottom

649
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,980
right there for that web shell and what

650
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,690
does this mean is as that you know isn't

651
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,210
when I was in college you know 20 plus

652
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,310
years ago we was talked about this idea

653
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,960
of utility infrastructure and it was

654
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,860
always a joke because it was never real

655
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,450
okay

656
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,570
but this is actually what is happening

657
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,820
now the near future looks a lot more

658
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,790
like the electrical grid in technology

659
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,560
than it does when you think about you

660
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,570
know the power grid for example you get

661
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,320
this declarative guarantee in that wall

662
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:39,379
outlet right there you get 120 amps 120

663
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,090
volts at 15 amps right and you in front

664
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,220
of the electro outlet I can do whatever

665
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,480
I want I can plug in my lamp I can plug

666
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,340
it in this outlet I can plug in my phone

667
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,350
and when I need more power

668
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,169
it's seamlessly provisioned for them and

669
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,820
behind the outlet my dev ops people can

670
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,610
do whatever they want they can bring in

671
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,800
you know power from solar they can bring

672
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,330
in power from nuclear they can bring in

673
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,120
power from wind it doesn't matter to me

674
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,040
from coal right so long as we meet at

675
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,290
that declarative point and this is

676
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,930
what's happening now is that on the

677
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:11,180
outside of the plug you've got the

678
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:14,120
container and then behind the container

679
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,470
you have kubernetes right now but I'll

680
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,800
tell you that it's not about kubernetes

681
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,720
in fact the technology specifically

682
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,220
doesn't matter the only thing that

683
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,130
matters is the guarantee that you're

684
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,960
given and if you are deploying things at

685
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,310
large scale if you're at Google if

686
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,380
you're a Facebook you're already

687
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,470
leveraging these techniques right

688
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,810
there's a reason why we hear less about

689
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,580
some of these mega providers getting

690
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,710
compromised and I believe one of the

691
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,330
main reasons why's is that they've been

692
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,340
the first to usher in and adopt these

693
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,889
new techniques of declarative

694
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,580
application postures on declarative

695
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,410
platforms and this sort of vision for

696
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,149
where we're going here is exactly like

697
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,010
they let clout lab that I can take my

698
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,670
app I can walk over and I can just say

699
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:00,290
app dot run write app dot deploy I don't

700
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,090
even have to think about app dot scale

701
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,860
because the metrics do it for me

702
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,199
automatically and if you're following

703
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,389
kubernetes this is what people are

704
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
working towards is this sort of highly

705
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,630
available

706
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,820
sure that that takes the pet out of the

707
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,460
equation that I don't care about sequel

708
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,799
one anymore sequel O two because there

709
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,870
are all just cattle to me and if one of

710
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,730
my cattle gets sick like my web show

711
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,489
lightest deployed well guess what I just

712
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,700
kill it right in fact I just you know

713
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,899
kill it and scale it which I'll pass on

714
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,240
that dumb oaf right now if you want to

715
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:34,939
see that afterwards I'm happy to sort of

716
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,260
do that now the kind of big caveat here

717
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,519
is is that Liam that's awesome the

718
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,860
future is gonna be amazing we've got

719
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,570
flying cars in my life sucks

720
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,418
because I deal with these things called

721
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,889
capital assets and we just put an

722
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:48,500
aircraft carrier to sea and it's not

723
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:50,689
coming back for 25 years so we're stuck

724
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,399
with what's on it today and we've got

725
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,049
these power plants we've got buildings

726
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,090
that we've got legacy financial

727
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,070
companies and we've got factories and

728
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,820
assembly lines I'm gonna put a pin in

729
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:04,189
that for a second for two reasons one if

730
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,600
you want to see OS query and bro and sis

731
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:10,779
bond just go on YouTube and watch my

732
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,580
previous talks but if you these are

733
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:15,080
symptoms of people problems because we

734
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,220
can bring innovation into these

735
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,899
environments and that's going to be the

736
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,659
call to action that I have at the end

737
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:22,370
here but on this on this utility model

738
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:24,409
of computing this is a huge opportunity

739
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,090
for some of you it will be a huge crisis

740
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,710
because your bread and butter is gonna

741
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,720
go away when you think about the

742
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,419
security model that happens with a

743
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,269
utility model imagine invading the GF I

744
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,980
see on that electrical outlet over there

745
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:39,169
imagine invading the fuses you can't

746
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,750
because it's baked into the underlying

747
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:44,179
stack and in the stacks and applications

748
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,130
that we've been building this is how we

749
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:48,380
deliver our controls we bake things like

750
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:50,870
selinux into the platform you can't turn

751
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,330
it off right we bake things like

752
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,539
container controls we bake in our layer

753
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:59,299
3 layer 4 and layer 7 controls right

754
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:01,100
we've got protocol analyzers implemented

755
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,779
in the Linux kernel so when you're

756
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,879
thinking about how would I run something

757
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,620
like bro in the cloud what you would

758
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
really what you're really asking is is

759
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,709
how do I do large-scale protocol

760
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,679
analysis in the cloud what you really

761
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,389
should be asking is is do I need to if I

762
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,090
know that all of my containers only have

763
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:19,459
a single binary in them and I know that

764
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,649
it's HTTP or whatever this transport

765
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,130
protocol is how many you know full

766
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:25,830
spectrum protocol analyzers just do

767
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,600
all right this is a huge opportunity

768
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,699
because everything that happens in this

769
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,620
is world is being reimagined right now

770
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,480
and there's an absolute frenzy in

771
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,080
thinking how do you do monitoring in

772
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,970
this world

773
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,560
how do you do alerting in this world how

774
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,180
do you do forensics in this world

775
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,490
how do you do Incident Response in this

776
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,710
world these are still Denise Ian's ideas

777
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:48,300
at best in this future infrastructure

778
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:51,510
that's being adopted today so let's come

779
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,669
back to one of the two root problems the

780
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:57,060
first being the user and the second

781
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,620
being capital assets and I want to give

782
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,020
you a quick crash course in the

783
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,669
psychology of app development because I

784
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,260
want you to understand you know what

785
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:08,070
we're up against when we're talking

786
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,310
about influencing our users when we

787
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,530
think about how we if we want to change

788
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,600
our users behavior it needs to be

789
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,090
motivated by this idea that we want to

790
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,990
deliver more value to the customer right

791
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:24,480
and we can do that accepting how the

792
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,100
customer works right accepting the

793
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,290
weaknesses of the customer we can

794
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,030
actually work with them to make it

795
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,420
happen I'm going to show you another

796
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,580
quick video here from one of the

797
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,920
founders of one of the early hires at

798
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,080
Facebook exploiting consumer behavior in

799
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,520
a consumer internet business you said

800
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,460
that this is a time for soul-searching

801
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,910
in social media businesses and and you

802
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,020
were part of building the largest one

803
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:53,960
what soul-searching are you doing right

804
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,960
now on that I feel tremendous guilt I

805
00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:01,350
think we I think we all knew in the back

806
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,540
of our minds even though we feigned this

807
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,330
whole line of like there probably aren't

808
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,280
any really bad unintended consequences I

809
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,010
think in the back

810
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:14,660
deep deep recesses of our minds we we

811
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:17,280
kind of knew something bad could happen

812
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:20,370
but I think the way we defined it was

813
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,730
not like this it literally is a point

814
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,590
now where I think we have created tools

815
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,770
that are ripping apart the social fabric

816
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,070
of how society works that is truly where

817
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:35,010
we are and I would encourage all of you

818
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,780
as the future leaders of the world to

819
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:40,020
really internalize how important

820
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,200
this is if you feed the Beast that beast

821
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,270
will destroy you if you push back on it

822
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,390
we have a chance to control it rein it

823
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:51,629
in and it is a point in time where

824
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,000
people need to hard break from some of

825
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,510
these tools and the things that you rely

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,150
on the short term dopamine driven

827
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:04,500
feedback loops that we have created are

828
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:07,710
destroying how society works what a

829
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,900
pause right there and I want to I want

830
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,300
to talk a little bit about the idea of

831
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,520
what he's saying let's talk about what

832
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,649
are these techniques and tools that

833
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,740
we're all susceptible to and how did

834
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,850
they influences first you're going to

835
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,950
talk about the psychology of

836
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,409
applications and the sort of derived

837
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,360
psychology of application security you

838
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,460
have to understand what human beings are

839
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,840
made of and the mind as we understand it

840
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,700
today sort of operates at three

841
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,980
different levels the first is the

842
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,510
central core this is the the reptilian

843
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,760
brain and we're not going to dignify

844
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,440
this one with any examples but

845
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,420
essentially it's you know can I eat it

846
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,100
can I have sex with it will it and and

847
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,990
you are familiar with all that

848
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,639
advertising right it's on it's plastered

849
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,220
on billboards it's in commercials it's

850
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,170
in movies you can't get away from it the

851
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,940
next is the most susceptible layer and

852
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,520
this is the limbic system and these are

853
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,390
your emotions your behavior and your

854
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,060
moods and these are very subject to

855
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,980
unconscious unconscious influence and

856
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,540
the final is what you think of as you is

857
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,760
what you think of your deciding brain

858
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,379
the cerebral cortex your conscious your

859
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,659
reasoning right and you can certainly

860
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:16,230
make arguments and say that these things

861
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,700
are better but there are underlying I'm

862
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,730
going to say influence techniques that

863
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:23,370
you could leverage in order to carry the

864
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,659
day that you should be using first let's

865
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,149
just look at a small sample of these

866
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,330
because there are hundreds so let's talk

867
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,310
about the goal gradient effect and it's

868
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,009
rooted in the fact that people are more

869
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,929
motivated as they approach a goal but

870
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,909
what's fascinating is is that you can

871
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,220
actually drive behavior in motivation

872
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,860
with an illusion if I give you two

873
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,230
membership cards each that have ten left

874
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:48,389
before you get a goal the studies show

875
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,399
that if the first two are stamped you

876
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,379
know twelve on this card

877
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,719
ten left blank on this card with ten

878
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:58,049
left you will be far more likely to

879
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,750
actually complete the one that has the

880
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:02,220
illusion of progress and it's sort of

881
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,089
baked in there rooted in the idea that

882
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,009
you're invested in that idea the

883
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:11,099
variable rewards or the idea that built

884
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:13,710
Las Vegas all right and this is the when

885
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:15,779
you want to incentivize behavior

886
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,750
it's how often do you give people their

887
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:22,049
results and your desired results could

888
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:25,920
be anything from likes to you know

889
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:27,770
reddit gold to hearts whatever the

890
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,740
whatever the case is it could be

891
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:33,869
additional space on a storage network

892
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,859
but these but delivering them in a

893
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:40,890
variable way ensures a higher degree of

894
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:43,529
addictive 'ti of the dopamine system the

895
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,680
wanting what drive searching is far more

896
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:49,589
powerful than the liking in rats for

897
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,240
example if you disable the wanting the

898
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,819
even if they still have the ability to

899
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,169
eat they will actually starve right they

900
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,700
have the ability to physically satiate

901
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,619
themselves but they can't drive

902
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,839
themselves forward so being able to take

903
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,210
advantage of the system's the

904
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:05,308
unpredictability stimulates dopamine and

905
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,109
these small bite size alerts that you

906
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:10,710
get on your phones that you get in your

907
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:13,170
little app notifications are triggering

908
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,359
you at that middle emotional layer

909
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:18,089
they're driving you forward and driving

910
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,980
your behavior for it now when you start

911
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:24,170
to learn even the basic rules of this

912
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:27,809
game you start to see the psychology of

913
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,000
application development and when we

914
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:32,579
think about as a security industry how

915
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,680
we should be driving forward positive

916
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,299
behaviors of change in our users we

917
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,279
should be doing a better job leveraging

918
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:40,200
these techniques so well leveraging

919
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:42,089
these techniques as well I'm sure for

920
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,500
the social engineers in the room this

921
00:36:42,089 --> 00:36:45,960
sort of little blurb here doesn't come

922
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,270
as any surprise to you there are you

923
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,400
know the confidence game is a long and

924
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,690
well understood far before social

925
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,789
engineers started to use it to test

926
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,829
networks but when you think about being

927
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:59,549
rewarded for being three steps away from

928
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:01,289
the for the bonus here having a gold

929
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:03,240
gradient of starting with your list

930
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:04,260
items already crossed out having a

931
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,870
milestone or delay

932
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,000
out for you notifications tying into

933
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,680
your social network these things are

934
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,530
subconsciously triggering you whether

935
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,779
you realized or not

936
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,520
so is it completely hopeless then we're

937
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,020
stuck with capital assets and we're

938
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,770
stuck with users that are easily

939
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,810
manipulated I'll say no and I'll look

940
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,870
around this room as the evidence as to

941
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:30,540
why not and that's that the evidence

942
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,220
that exists today as far as why are you

943
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,560
here in this room this morning is is

944
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,100
that we are each called to a

945
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,750
self-directed challenge to drive a

946
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,299
self-directed challenge to pursue

947
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,700
technical expertise mastery and making a

948
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,350
contribution and we think about why

949
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,990
people are here this early in the

950
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,759
morning

951
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:53,520
studying security on their own it's

952
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,990
because they're driven by passion and I

953
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,060
think that when you look at the sort of

954
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,310
derived things we see in our industry to

955
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,560
derive positive things this is what

956
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,049
gives me hope right this is what has

957
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,570
kept me on the road teaching you know

958
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:09,030
the 170 some odd bro workshops that I've

959
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,800
taught right you know I don't I used to

960
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,480
do that commercially but for the last

961
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,980
you know five six years we've not been

962
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,500
charging for those and we just show up

963
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,390
and we teach a class right it's fun it's

964
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,430
to drive the mastery for myself and I'm

965
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:25,279
hopeful that if you're here you also

966
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:29,700
have those similar types of drivers

967
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:35,850
stick one last little video here sorry

968
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:37,529
not the right link perfect go back in

969
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,089
time a little bit imagine I imagine this

970
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,280
if I went to my first economics

971
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:44,370
professor a woman named Mary Alice

972
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,100
Schulman and I went to her in 1983 and

973
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,040
said professor Shulman can I talk to you

974
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,420
after class for a moment yeah just I got

975
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,740
this inkling I got this idea for a

976
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,760
business model I just want to run it

977
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,729
past you here's how it would work you

978
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,860
get a bunch of people around the world

979
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:04,070
we're doing highly-skilled work but

980
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,270
they're willing to do it for free and

981
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,000
volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30

982
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,900
hours a week

983
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,550
okay she's looking at you somewhat

984
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,240
skeptically there open up but I'm not

985
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:18,180
done and then what they create they give

986
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,419
it away rather than sell it it's good

987
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,520
be huge you sure what if she truly would

988
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,900
have thought I was insane okay it seemed

989
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,759
to fly in the face of so many things but

990
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,390
what do you have you have Linux powering

991
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,890
one out of does sound insane and it

992
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,020
sounds insane when you think about

993
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,240
things like the open-source community

994
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,069
things like the security community when

995
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,808
you think about the resources that we

996
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:42,089
pull together as a team the information

997
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:45,059
that we share the keynote from last year

998
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:47,490
was this amazing tour of the room almost

999
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,900
where the speaker walked around the room

1000
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,520
and talked about all the amazing

1001
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,529
contributions that people in the room

1002
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,630
had been dropping and those are the

1003
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:56,849
things that give me hope that we do in

1004
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:01,589
fact have a path forward to bail our way

1005
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:03,450
out of these capital assets so we're

1006
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:06,150
thinking about what the sort of call to

1007
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,470
action here is is that we really have

1008
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,089
this challenge to enable innovation and

1009
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,220
if you're in a large organization that's

1010
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:16,980
a big problem all right if you're in a

1011
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,919
government agency or if you work for you

1012
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,779
know fortune 500 and it's that execution

1013
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,910
eats innovation all right when you're

1014
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:26,640
executing a model you spin up around

1015
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,529
that model you metrics everything and

1016
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,190
you drive out all deviations in

1017
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:34,829
difference and when you are innovating

1018
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,869
you actually by design want to make

1019
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:38,970
mistakes very quickly right it's your

1020
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:40,770
job to make mistakes very quickly but to

1021
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,240
execution that innovation thing down

1022
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,369
there that nisi and little seed looks

1023
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,848
like a weed we must drive that out we

1024
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:50,450
must kill it we must stomp on it now

1025
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:53,940
there has been a huge emergence of

1026
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,319
business model thinking that started at

1027
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,750
Berkeley and other places around the

1028
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,630
world but it's been coupled with folks

1029
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,730
like IB EO and that's that products can

1030
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,890
be built that have a blend of

1031
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,589
desirability feasibility and viability

1032
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,390
that desirable I can have a new method

1033
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:11,400
to build products that my customers want

1034
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,049
that they're feasible I can actually

1035
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,869
accomplish these things and that they're

1036
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:17,970
viable I can spin up an open-source

1037
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:20,400
business model for example I can spin up

1038
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,470
a financial model where I give away my

1039
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,450
core product for free think about like

1040
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,700
Google Google gives you free search

1041
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,828
that's a good value proposition for you

1042
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,230
you'll spend a lot of time on that that

1043
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:31,920
gives them a new key asset called all of

1044
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,230
you

1045
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,089
they can turn itself to advertisers that

1046
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,440
is a phenomenally powerful business

1047
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:40,140
model that's driven with some very

1048
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,700
simple principles these are the the

1049
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,140
tools and techniques we use at work but

1050
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,879
we've adopted this methodology called

1051
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,618
jobs to be done where you sort of get

1052
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,180
really deep and you're looking for jobs

1053
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,190
that are both important tangible

1054
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,960
lucrative and unsolved and you recognize

1055
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,880
that around security we do a good job

1056
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,619
with the functional jobs we'll release

1057
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,359
these core engines or frameworks or

1058
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,670
concepts or ideas that are very

1059
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,710
functional to get the job done but they

1060
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,069
leave undone many of the product is

1061
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,869
Asian pieces the emotional concerns can

1062
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:07,770
I use this can I be successful the

1063
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:09,900
social concerns

1064
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,930
how does my boss look at me for using an

1065
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,150
unsupported tool the supporting jobs how

1066
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:18,480
to install it how do i upgrade it how do

1067
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:21,030
I run it and my call to action to you is

1068
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,980
to think about where you can start to

1069
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,559
adopt these techniques into insecurity

1070
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,770
so at this time I want to pause real

1071
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,059
quick

1072
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:35,599
and I just want to pause for some

1073
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:35,599
questions okay thanks for your time
