I'll sent alright today's talk is gonna

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,809
be about open source intelligence with a

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,899
framework that I wrote with a couple

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,160
friends so well good this out of the way

19
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,510
used to be in the info check out cast I

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,759
got a job a couple months ago so I'm

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,399
official so I work for a telecom company

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,920
doing red team and pen testing we're

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,619
looking for people that that want to get

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,210
a job there that can do that type of

25
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:23,759
stuff so if you're interested come see

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:26,460
me after the talk yeah a Mexico LX on on

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,810
Twitter github it used to be pornhub and

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,880
then I found that somebody actually has

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,119
that that has some weird fetish with

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,509
milfs and chicks with hair so that's no

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,909
longer me I run an old website ill mod

32
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,270
org password recovery site what's my

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,670
pass com pentesting wiki Church of O'Dea

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,590
org my personal site where I do like

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,509
stuff with Arduino Raspberry Pi cetera

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,640
and then I used to run track somebody

37
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,770
calm which was kind of like the basis

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,509
for this program it was all web-based

39
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,949
and I decided to make a Galka man line

40
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,119
and stop paying for the domain so open

41
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,770
source intelligence is basically

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,600
anything that you can collect from any

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,728
publicly source data without paying for

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,739
it a lot of times most of this

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,150
information is behind a paywall or it's

46
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,349
behind some api that you got to pay for

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,840
usage

48
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,369
so I'm trying to work it with scraping

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:26,129
stuff that comes from all these free

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:28,109
sites I'm not a lawyer I looked into a

51
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,349
little about web scraping there is some

52
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:33,540
gray areas with it so use that your own

53
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,649
discretion most of these sites I don't

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,090
think they'll go after you because most

55
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,099
of them don't have the data legally

56
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,099
anyhow so it should be good

57
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:45,870
originally a lot of the tools used

58
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,489
originally was multigo you would use

59
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,950
that transforms and all that stuff it

60
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,109
was proprietary software it comes free

61
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,448
with Kali for the Community Edition they

62
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,500
have a paid version I have no idea what

63
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,400
it cost because I didn't want to pay for

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,340
it a lot of money but yeah it's it's

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,650
pretty good at visualizing a lot of data

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,349
resources people have made transforms to

67
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,969
do everything from like looking up

68
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,578
passwords from data breaches old emails

69
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:14,939
all that stuff so it's it is really good

70
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:18,379
with the resources but again I'm cheap

71
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:21,269
another good good source is recon ng

72
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,090
command line tool it uses a lot of api's

73
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,009
a lot of the api's are paid such as

74
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,989
LinkedIn and stuff like that so again

75
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,689
it's good if you can get some of the

76
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,709
free stuff out of it but some of the

77
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:37,439
paid versions are not that great and so

78
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:40,769
I'm this tool basically is Google

79
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,780
everybody notice ID at Google a lot of

80
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,509
times you can Google dork and get a lot

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,729
of information and cross-reference

82
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:49,828
whatever information that you can get

83
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,500
from it and then and then go deeper in

84
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,259
your search why is scraping and better

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,229
than api's it's cheap I don't have to

86
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:01,048
pay for some some company for a thousand

87
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,419
hits on their API or some pay wall

88
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,139
that's $19.99 a month there's no

89
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,400
limitations basically what we try to do

90
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,400
to get around it originally we were

91
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,168
doing proxying and changing the the

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,548
headers to avoid them to stop us they're

93
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,320
getting a little better at at stopping

94
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,120
some stuff I just had to update some

95
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,900
stuff this week but we're still getting

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,060
around all of it

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,620
and it's getting all the results that we

98
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,940
want so basically we just want the

99
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,510
information we don't want to look at a

100
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,389
bunch of ads and crap and so

101
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,300
the original idea for the site was track

102
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,830
somebody calm it was basically a

103
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,460
JavaScript based site where you would go

104
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,280
to the different the different pages you

105
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,870
can look up stuff by screen name email I

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,320
P address name phone etc it would

107
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:56,440
basically pop up as a window you would

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,510
put in the information and it would just

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,310
pop up different tabs with all those

110
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,500
different sites so instead of doing that

111
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,110
a lot of the the browsers like Chrome

112
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,930
and Internet Explorer Firefox they

113
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,240
started blocking websites from popping

114
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,220
up a billion tabs so it only really

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,419
worked if you let your guard down and

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,700
nobody really wants to do that with all

117
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,219
the spam and crap so that I let this

118
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,419
domain expire last year it's probably a

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,040
month before I came up with this idea

120
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,690
and I still kicking myself because

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,600
somebody took it and I think they're

122
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,930
asking like five grand for it now I do

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,180
have a legacy version on on ill mod org

124
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,010
fort slash bookmarked HTML which is

125
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,310
basically the same thing you click the

126
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,919
buttons up top and you just look up the

127
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,430
query I also have a license plate lookup

128
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,590
on there where it will look up just the

129
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,289
VIN information and the car information

130
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,150
you won't get the person's information

131
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,169
or their address because DMV gets a

132
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,739
little pissed when you're tapping into

133
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:56,229
that but these also are bookmarklets

134
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,820
that you can that you can drag up on

135
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,380
like Firefox drag them up to your

136
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,700
toolbar and you can click them right

137
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,300
from your toolbar and do it from there

138
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,680
you don't have to do it from the page so

139
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,930
basically you would click on it you put

140
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,090
in the information who it is all that

141
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,100
and then it would open up all these tabs

142
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,859
with the different information you go

143
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,260
through you scrape it that manually is a

144
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,300
pain in the ass so what what I wanted to

145
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,460
do with the program is basically have

146
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,860
the same idea hit all these websites and

147
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,539
then pull the information that I wanted

148
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,360
from there and although not all the

149
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,530
different crap with the fake say sites

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,720
that are trying to click you to their

151
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,150
paywall site pretending that they're

152
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,979
scanning for all this information so

153
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,359
basically I tried to pick out most of

154
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,330
the good say

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,680
and get the ones that were not popping

156
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,698
up a whole bunch of captures all that

157
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,069
stuff so I found that Python works well

158
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,110
with beautifulsoup

159
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:54,099
to pull the information we're using

160
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:56,889
beautifulsoup and scraping json so

161
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,438
basically what it does is it goes to the

162
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:02,289
site the codes a little crazy

163
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,759
we tried over the summer time before Def

164
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,610
Con we tried to update it to Python 3

165
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,650
and that was just a show so we

166
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,479
backtracked a little bit and and went

167
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,529
back to Python 2.7 for a little while

168
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,909
until we can get all the stuff working

169
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:21,789
I'm not the greatest coder I can make

170
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:23,770
 work but like my codes a mess this

171
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,150
is just something I made all the

172
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,279
companies now they're using buzzwords

173
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,169
you know machine learning all this other

174
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,939
 it's just if statements that's all

175
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,258
it's doing so there's nothing fancy

176
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:35,979
about like machine learning and all this

177
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:38,620
blinky box it but so basically our

178
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:43,060
concept is uh yeah it's in the cloud and

179
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,909
AI and all that so basically what the

180
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,279
site does is it's scraping it connects

181
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,469
to the site gathers the HTML and then it

182
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,810
just parses all that information with

183
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:56,649
beautifulsoup and just gets the needle

184
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,210
in the haystack pretty much it it just

185
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,939
and then it just produces it on the

186
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:05,020
screen for you we're adding abilities to

187
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:07,360
output to excel word right now it's just

188
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,900
doing JSON output which you can pretty

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,770
much feed into a lot of

190
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,568
[Music]

191
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:16,659
so basically skip-tracer this is what it

192
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:20,529
is it's a it's a command-line Python

193
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:23,349
script what it does is it has a bunch of

194
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:28,139
different sections that you can do with

195
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:30,580
phone license plate domains IP addresses

196
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,370
and gives you all the choices and all

197
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,478
the return information from it this

198
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,948
example here is the phone reverse phone

199
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,750
if you notice it's a kevin mitnick's

200
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:43,029
number which he has on his card so I

201
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,750
guess it's safe enough to to look up

202
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:49,269
without him crying about it but it hits

203
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,230
a couple sites who called 401 info true

204
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,610
people search

205
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,040
an advanced background checks and truth

206
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,740
finder and then it just displays all

207
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,660
that information on there with the phone

208
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,310
a lot of times it's tied in to your

209
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,560
personal information you'll get stuff

210
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,000
like your current address if you notice

211
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,369
at the bottom his date of birth is at

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,950
the bottom so it basically pulls all

213
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,540
that stuff up and cross-references it

214
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,160
and we don't do all the heavy lifting

215
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,260
we're just pulling all this all this

216
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,689
stuff from the sites and and just

217
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,830
displaying it for you and doing a

218
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:23,620
quicker time this is the email one had a

219
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,780
little issues with this recently hacked

220
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,720
emails which was a breach database they

221
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,490
went down because the gdpr they didn't

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,870
want to get screwed about putting out

223
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,880
people's personal information if they

224
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,770
don't know what part of the continent

225
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,960
are well part of the world they're in so

226
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,069
they basically bow down how about been

227
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,150
poned is still up because they're not

228
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:45,970
really showing the the actual passwords

229
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,280
and stuff like that and who is mine

230
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,110
which was a reverse DNS it just

231
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,510
basically looked if that email had

232
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,890
registered a domain it would put up put

233
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,900
up those domains so that was further

234
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,760
your digital trail to find out who

235
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,319
someone was or if they had some sort of

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,370
website that you can get some more

237
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,380
information from username recon it goes

238
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,660
through know'm and name check and it

239
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,430
basically checks all these sites to see

240
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,540
if there's accounts on there

241
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,979
and a lot of times I'm putting these

242
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,630
different sites on there because there

243
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,130
is different information from some of

244
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,980
them some of them will say there's a

245
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,189
valid account here and one here but it

246
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,900
it's not exactly exact so I try to get

247
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,580
as much data as possible for people to

248
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,630
go with and then they can they can do

249
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,890
their leg --look from there just

250
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,890
basically compile it in one spot

251
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,480
username our first name and last name

252
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,430
basically some of the sites go through

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
and ask you where the person's from so

254
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,689
if they have a common name it helps get

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,760
it down to like if you know the zip code

256
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,800
maybe where they're at or the state or

257
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,560
the town it will pull up anybody with

258
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
that name in that area it's gonna look

259
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,489
if it's male or female it's gonna look

260
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,670
at their age some of them just asked if

261
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,350
they're over 30 some asked the age range

262
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,839
so you could basically broaden it down

263
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,280
to get everything down and if you look

264
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,710
at it still there's a lot of information

265
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,370
that that still pulls up if you look at

266
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,680
Kevin's in for me

267
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,990
again it's uh it's shown his date of

268
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,939
birth his phone numbers some emails that

269
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,130
he that he's used and you'll see some

270
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,600
mixed information like that Gandhi net

271
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,460
email was was some privacy email that

272
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,020
was on one of his websites so that got

273
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,570
scooped up into some sort of database

274
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:27,790
and it's it's in there now and then the

275
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,279
one of the other ones I this is one that

276
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,630
we just added it's it's uh it was in

277
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,339
there before but it was just given us

278
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,200
issues we're gonna add a second site

279
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,080
because this one's a little weird about

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,360
the the timing on it it's basically when

281
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,980
you when you hit up the the the plate

282
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,450
number and the state sometimes it

283
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,940
returned it says no Return info

284
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,950
sometimes it does as you see it gives

285
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,770
out the event information the make and

286
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,350
model and where the car was built and

287
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,500
stuff like that I've used it like one or

288
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,089
two times I had a client of mine that

289
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,460
was a liquor store and basically

290
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,839
somebody had stolen from there and they

291
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,310
didn't know what type of car it was but

292
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,690
they did have the plate on camera so we

293
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,969
figured out what type of car gave that

294
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,459
information up so some some of that

295
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,940
stuff's cool like I said it's happening

296
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:15,459
DMV is a different story and the last

297
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,529
one that we have that I just started to

298
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:20,290
add was the domain stuff we're using

299
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,990
stuff like certificate transparency to

300
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,790
pull up the subdomains from for websites

301
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,959
and stuff like that so in the demo I'll

302
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,069
go through it

303
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:33,119
hopefully the Internet's not going to

304
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,120
screw up on here but we're gonna try

305
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:45,199
yeah so let's see if this let me know if

306
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
you guys

307
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:56,510
see this I tried to like make it as big

308
00:12:46,880 --> 00:13:00,400
as possible so one of the hoops is

309
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,400
off-screen again damn it

310
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,520
alright so basically what you do you

311
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,840
would start it up with uh with Python

312
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,000
you would call it Python skip-tracer

313
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,910
about PI it comes up with a menu we

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,380
tried to model it after like kind of

315
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,120
like a Metasploit menu or something like

316
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,860
that where it's it's just got the the

317
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,140
menus and you go through the the

318
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,920
different questions and stuff on there

319
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:32,949
so the first one I want to do hopefully

320
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:37,459
if it works will do the phone one first

321
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:44,390
you know I know Kevin this number works

322
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:45,590
so we'll try that so basically it's

323
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,080
gonna ask you what phone number you want

324
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,880
you put it in there and then it's gonna

325
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,140
go through the different sites and pull

326
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,860
up that information scrape that

327
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,360
information for you so this one you have

328
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,100
the option to to go through all of them

329
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,230
at one time or you can do them singly

330
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,450
for each site and see what see what

331
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,010
information is on there like who called

332
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,010
is pretty good because it tells you the

333
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,330
carrier for it when the the phone may

334
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,130
have been registered or the number at

335
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,500
may have been registered it gave their

336
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,910
general information and stuff like that

337
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,740
and as you see there's different sites

338
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,600
that you can run it through the best one

339
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,430
usually is advanced background checks

340
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,810
and if they go to a paywall it's gonna

341
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,329
suck because they're the ones that give

342
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,400
out most of the information that's on

343
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,260
there like you'll get there you'll get

344
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,600
their addresses you'll get relatives

345
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,030
you'll get their date of birth pretty

346
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,950
much anything about that person a lot of

347
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,120
times you're going to get some some

348
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,800
different information rolled in there

349
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,260
because people like to use kevin's

350
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,959
number for like filling out credit cards

351
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,970
and stuff like that so so you will see

352
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,230
some some other stuff that's kind of

353
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,230
kind of spammed in there

354
00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,069
all right and what you can do too is

355
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,749
basically when you put in the target as

356
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,179
you see up top his numbers still up in

357
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,649
the top so it's not gonna ask you again

358
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,480
it's a if I want to go to true people

359
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:10,470
search it's not gonna ask me for that

360
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,509
number again

361
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,739
number six you could reset the target it

362
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,689
will ask you for a new phone number and

363
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:18,749
then you can go and and get stuff like

364
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:22,439
that seven the option seven will bring

365
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:24,869
you back to the the previous screen

366
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:29,160
so right now we're gonna test out email

367
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:33,709
see if that works well I guess we'll do

368
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:37,559
just LinkedIn right now and this uses a

369
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:39,748
trick that's not a lot of people know

370
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,809
about but there is a URL that will pop

371
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:45,480
up that if you add the email to the to

372
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,160
that URL and you're signing in too late

373
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,739
LinkedIn you'll get their information

374
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,259
from their LinkedIn profile the only

375
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:54,179
issue with that right now I have I have

376
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,139
my my LinkedIn username and password

377
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:59,970
logged in there but if you hit this

378
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:02,850
using your own your own profile and not

379
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,619
like some some other profile like Kevin

380
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,360
will get a notification that I looked at

381
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:10,230
his profile and he probably thinks I'm

382
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,600
stalking him now but uh but yeah it goes

383
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,429
through a whole bunch of stuff like

384
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,519
you'll you know you won't get results I

385
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:19,519
don't think he has a myspace anymore and

386
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,730
yeah he's been a few times so so the

387
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,238
have I been poned is pretty good because

388
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,860
it goes through all the different uh all

389
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:34,319
the different data breaches that that

390
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,179
Troy hunt gets so if you're lucky enough

391
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,179
to find some of this and Kevin hasn't

392
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,970
changed I think it was like Mitnick six

393
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:44,040
six six or something was his password if

394
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,470
he hasn't changed it on some other site

395
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,579
you might be able to log into his old

396
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,720
profiles or whatever and do what you

397
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,719
need to do to mess with them

398
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,589
yeah well I mean people are still using

399
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,869
it I guess

400
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,990
and now that aim is dead I don't think

401
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,279
there's a lot of people using it anymore

402
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:08,130
yahoo messenger went down all those good

403
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:13,380
ones so the next one we'll do is do

404
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:16,520
screen name i'll just a condor is kind

405
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:26,490
of common what do you have like a uh

406
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:41,309
annoyed with a zero right yeah i can't

407
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:43,020
type so it will show that there may be

408
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,610
somebody might not be the actual noid

409
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,860
but it will show that they have a

410
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,110
password and maybe he's doing some arts

411
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:54,209
and crafts on etsy and stuff like that

412
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:56,010
I mean Nolan is pretty good with the

413
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,710
actual that there was an actual account

414
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,110
on their name check sometimes it will

415
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,030
give you a false positive where it'll

416
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,439
pull up there it will say that there's a

417
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,530
count there and you go to that account

418
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,720
and there's it's a 404 but if you

419
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,059
noticed it's a kind of a common name it

420
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,470
may or may not be him but I've used this

421
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,330
a lot to find like a bunch of old

422
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:19,070
friends from like 20 years ago on IRC

423
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,299
and start pulling them into my channel

424
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,610
yeah so like that this one this one's

425
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,410
good name check is good yeah name trucks

426
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,479
is is good because it actually shows the

427
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,040
actual URL instead of trying to go

428
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,250
trying to figure out what the URL for

429
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,809
the users are so it works pretty it

430
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,809
works pretty well in that aspect

431
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:55,210
so well there's actually uh we'll see if

432
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:59,110
he has a tinder profile now like I've I

433
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:01,390
reset this and say just to you my name

434
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,300
and then I don't have tender so it's

435
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:09,580
gonna be some random dude but you can

436
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:11,530
friend them if you want so yeah

437
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,689
basically what that will do is it'll

438
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:16,180
check tinder and that's basically their

439
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,010
their profile picture I'll give you the

440
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,720
URL for that it will give you the name

441
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,190
that they put on there and whatever bio

442
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,230
sometimes the bio is where they work

443
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,970
sometimes if they go to college and it

444
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:33,280
gives you their name if they didn't lie

445
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:35,200
about it or some random age and then the

446
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,240
final one was the domain one that I'm

447
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,360
still kind of working on but basically

448
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,060
it uses the the xfr techniques to check

449
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:49,750
the search from the site so if i wanted

450
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:52,270
to check when we do fairfield ET you you

451
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:59,620
gotta spell around oh yeah i can't type

452
00:19:52,270 --> 00:20:04,410
for yeah i don't know if it erase

453
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,409
or wrapped around let's see what happens

454
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,160
yeah so yeah just didn't wrap around so

455
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,260
basically if you were doing any recon on

456
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,610
like someone's website it's gonna pull

457
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,760
up all those subdomains for you

458
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,199
automatically it's a lot easier than

459
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,060
going to like say like dns dumpster

460
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,250
which we're gonna add do you dns

461
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,450
dumpster has an api but it's not paid so

462
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,100
we want to add that on there and add

463
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,990
that capability because sometimes

464
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,719
there's stuff in like dns dumpsters

465
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,250
that's not showing this way so you might

466
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,110
get some weird sub domain that they

467
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:43,120
forgot about or anybody forgot about and

468
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:45,280
start your recon from there and that's

469
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,620
most actually did we do the plate now we

470
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,899
did do the plate this one is like hit or

471
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,969
miss sometimes like I said you know if

472
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,140
we want to look up who has the plate

473
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:58,029
hacker they live in Alabama and

474
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,379
basically yeah it shows

475
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,659
you know they've been number the making

476
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:03,488
model so you can guess you know whatever

477
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,469
whoever has the plate that you want and

478
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:08,769
then you can figure out you know whose

479
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:11,049
card is etc blah blah blah we are

480
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,570
working on new newer stuff and more

481
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,190
sites to add I started this before I

482
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,989
started my job a few months ago so I

483
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,749
haven't had time to really work on it as

484
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:22,289
much as I want to but we just got all

485
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:27,940
the stuff done this week to fix it

486
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:31,658
basically the couple guys here I think

487
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,849
on the next slide actually yeah so we're

488
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,200
working on more plug on plugins we're

489
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,460
gonna work on API support for some of

490
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,839
the sites that are free and we don't

491
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,960
have to worry about paying for all that

492
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,279
crap the output we're working on like I

493
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,739
said there's JSON now

494
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,929
docx we have working it's just we

495
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:48,039
haven't uploaded it yet we want to we

496
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:51,599
want to do some cool stuff with that

497
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:54,639
also CSV Excel spreadsheets etc

498
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,129
hopefully get around GDP are it's just

499
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:58,658
basically I don't care about it so if

500
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:02,978
it's pulling up information that I want

501
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:04,359
scrum it's out there so yeah it's

502
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,149
basically all these guys helped me out

503
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,408
in the progress of getting this to work

504
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:10,718
should I couldn't figure out in in

505
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:14,349
Python so it's like basically now it's

506
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:15,759
mine but but yeah these guys help on a

507
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,589
day to day when I have stupid questions

508
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,309
about why something isn't working in the

509
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:23,619
scraping etc but yeah we're also looking

510
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,269
for other people if you're interested in

511
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,889
helping out know Python or you know some

512
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,679
sites that like you'd like to see that

513
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:31,539
we can scrape that don't have the api's

514
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,119
although all the the pop-ups and all

515
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:36,489
that crap you know just hit me up on

516
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,418
github it's there for now I know

517
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,799
everybody's crying about github

518
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,499
microsoft owns them now and they're

519
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,269
moving over to other crap we're gonna be

520
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,099
there for now until we like break off to

521
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:46,179
somewhere else when the codes finely

522
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:50,499
polished we'll probably get it done

523
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:51,820
under something else so but yeah other

524
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,649
than that that's pretty much it I mean

525
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,149
it's we went over a whole bunch of stuff

526
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:57,149
and you got questions

527
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:04,849
well yeah I mean you can you can write

528
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,918
the plug in right now we don't have like

529
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,178
a bass plug-in where you just plug in

530
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,070
the information and try to get all that

531
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,479
stuff out we're probably gonna get an

532
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,489
example one to make it a little bit

533
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,659
easier because right now we kind of

534
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,950
dumbed down the code a little bit

535
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,409
because we went a little crazy with the

536
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,639
the proxying and all that stuff and some

537
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:20,929
people couldn't figure out so we're like

538
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,059
okay let's tone it down a little bit

539
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:25,549
will let people proxy it through tor or

540
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:27,830
etc if they want to and let them do that

541
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,720
and you know if they're not using that

542
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,039
that website too much are hitting it too

543
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,239
much you're not going to come up with

544
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,239
the CAPTCHAs and all that other stuff

545
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:54,799
yep yeah so we'll get some stuff like

546
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,289
that with yeah yeah I mean shoda and

547
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,239
Shonen does give the guy that runs the

548
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,070
site is pretty nice you know if your

549
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:04,639
student I think they give you a free

550
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,439
account with a lot of stuff or I hit him

551
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,228
up I said I ran a hackerspace and he's

552
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,220
like here have an API key so he's pretty

553
00:24:09,229 --> 00:24:12,590
cool about it

554
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,899
but yeah we will have that stuff an

555
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,178
examples for people to work on stuff but

556
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:18,889
again if you if you find some stuff or

557
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:20,659
find any cool sites that that may have

558
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:22,758
some some information that we can scrape

559
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:24,649
easy enough it shouldn't be that hard to

560
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,299
really add it into there I'm like I said

561
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:28,609
we're always we're always looking here

562
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,809
and there for for new sites and trying

563
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,999
to find the best ones that give the most

564
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:34,190
information on like advanced background

565
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,960
checks when it originally started that

566
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,909
page we didn't realize if we scroll down

567
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,659
all the way to the bottom of the page

568
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:43,159
there was actually a JSON output so

569
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,690
instead of scraping that stuff and

570
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:47,720
parsing it with beautifulsoup you just

571
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,279
grab the the JSON I think they're either

572
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,229
they updated their site this week or

573
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,149
they're on to us but they they try to

574
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:54,619
screw with the JSON this week so it

575
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:57,258
wasn't working up until last night we

576
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:58,609
figured it out got it working but yeah

577
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,039
it's it's it's staying ahead of them

578
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:03,710
hoping that they don't go to a paywall

579
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,599
but for the most part you know most of

580
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,669
these sites are pretty freeing and get

581
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,669
all the information you'd be amazed at

582
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:12,560
what you find old emails come up

583
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,330
and pull up information on you and like

584
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,820
maybe you you know before you were aware

585
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,470
of security you know you may be filled

586
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,020
out a credit card application that's in

587
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,700
some crappy database that LexisNexis or

588
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,400
somebody else bought and resold and

589
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,250
resold and resold but it does pull up

590
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:32,750
some some crazy stuff any other

591
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:35,690
questions on anybody good good good all

592
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,100
right yeah thank you everybody hope you

593
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,590
enjoyed besides it's their fifth year

594

that we're doing it one of the

595
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,179
co-founders and and co-organizers we

596
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,510
tried to make this cooler and cooler

597
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,420
each year biggest year so far it had

598
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:53,960
over 200 people sign up compared to

599
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,030
doubling our last year's event so but

600
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,920
yeah stick around we're gonna have gonna

601
