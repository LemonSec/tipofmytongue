and be out here this early on a Saturday

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,600

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,539
while already so here we go round 2 will

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,829

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,329

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,609
of you before you're old so I've been

27
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,090
going for quite some time already um so

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,250
to give you a quick sense this is not

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,450
gonna be the same as the other

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,150
presentations you're gonna hear today

31
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,939
this is not technical this is not

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,979
anything IT this is not systems and

33
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:21,770
networks this is how do we make your

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:24,330
jobs more secure and better and how are

35
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,399
executives in this space now how are

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,350
seaso is how our CIOs how are people who

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
want to move up the food chain in this

38
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,059
space thinking and what are they taking

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,460
into account so that they can be better

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,799
at their jobs this day so we're talking

41
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,960
about Incident Response communications

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,299
specifically Incident Response obviously

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
a big piece but we're talking about the

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,130
one element that is quite often the most

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,320
overlooked and that's when something

46
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,539
happens how do you communicate so that

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,600
you don't make everything worse

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,040
I like say how do you avoid actually

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,240
pouring gasoline on yourself when

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,670
someone else is already lighting a match

51
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,798
and throwing it at you so this is where

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,549
we're gonna start a quick little

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,129
background on why I'm in this space and

54
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,569
why I do this and as Roman was saying I

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,049
come from a background in national

56
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,450
security

57
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,980
I spent a decade in DC Department of

58
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,780
Defense

59
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,340
see Capitol Hill all over the place in

60
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,099
the day corporate communications in New

61
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,840
York and missed the security

62
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,268
I found the corporate space to be

63
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,000
incredibly boring but really really

64
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,769
enjoy helping companies organizations

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,870
protect themselves and defend themselves

66
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,090
so I went out on my own and I get to

67
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,590
overlap all those fun things but from

68
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,299
all those different perspectives have

69
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,540
realized this is quite often a blind

70
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,760
spot that harms organizations so whether

71
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:45,560
you are in-house in a security team or

72
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,048
in an IT role or you are with a company

73
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,819
a vendor who's providing these services

74
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,750
being more familiar and more aware of

75
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,700
this full sort of 360 view of security

76
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,790
for a business actually will make you

77
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,480
better so a little bit on the why this

78
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:05,780
all matters and this right here kind of

79
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,119
sums it up when you read about data

80
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,060
breaches when you read about any type of

81
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,010
cyber incident that happens the reason

82
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,680
you're reading about it is because it

83
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,030
sucks nobody reads about the little

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,620
things nobody reads about the little

85
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,299
bump that happened that's a typical

86
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,489
Tuesday afternoon glitch in the system

87
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,590
you read about the things that get to

88
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,230
the level that's worth reading about and

89
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,669
the really big things that you read

90
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,069
about over and over and over and over

91
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:33,769
again you read about because somebody

92
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,510
screwed up the response you don't read

93
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,790
about it once you read about it 30 times

94
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,230
40 times you read about it you know

95
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,200
we're still reading about updates on

96
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,470
Yahoo and Equifax and things like that

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,679
because they screwed it up so this right

98
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,139
here by this little dumpster fire

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,389
picture has been a permanent fixture in

100
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,310
my Twitter feed from everybody and their

101
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,200
mother who uses it to describe every new

102
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,359
thing that happens because everything is

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,500
basically a dumpster fire you can throw

104
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,000
a match at a dumpster and it's not gonna

105
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,069
catch on fire but if you pour gasoline

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,019
on it yourself then you're gonna get a

107
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,119
big ol dumpster fire so that's what

108
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,639
we're gonna work on and this right here

109
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,889
some up

110
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,810
smart communications from the beginning

111
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,418
when you're doing a good incident

112
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,120
response plan can actually improve

113
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:22,580
organizational resiliency to make your

114
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,099
company better capable of weathering a

115
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,440
storm and you can also just avoid making

116
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,990
everything more pain

117
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,240
avoid making everything worse along the

118
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,600
way and at the end of the day the job

119
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,910
you save may be your own so we're gonna

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,660
start with some fun facts communications

121
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,400
it's not just for the PR team anymore

122
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,450
going back to some of what dr. Scholl

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,789
was just saying the idea of

124
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,880
cybersecurity is a really fun word that

125
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,500
everyone outside of our sphere and this

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,420
bubble here doesn't always understand

127
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,280
like you're saying they want to spend

128
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,930
all this money on products and all these

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,340
like magic boxes that we pull off a

130
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,590
shelf and we plug in and everybody's

131
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,510
happy well it doesn't work that way but

132
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,909
you know what the reality is everybody

133
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,800
who doesn't understand it wants to talk

134
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,560
about it and they usually have the money

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,530
to spend on it so you have to help them

136
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,620
understand what they should be spending

137
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,409
their money on and help them understand

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:24,420
the smart way to invest those resources

139
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,340
so that they create an actually secure

140
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,550
organization or as we'll see not just

141
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,469
secure but resilient so communications

142
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,210
you have to do it you have to embrace it

143
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,160
whether you like it or not not all

144
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,840
communications are created equal there's

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,580
the kind of communications that you need

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,690
internally to convince somebody that you

147
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,520
need the budgets that you need the

148
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,920
resources that they don't just need to

149
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,510
buy a million dollar box off the shelf

150
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,490
but maybe if they spent some on some

151
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,380
training or some people that it might

152
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,670
actually have a better impact there's

153
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,380
also the communications that we're gonna

154
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,080
talk about today that we're gonna focus

155
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,730
on which is specifically incident

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,849
response specifically crisis

157
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,320
communications but in a cyber setting so

158
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,020
there's a difference there between the

159
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,430
communications that your PR team will do

160
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,680
that promote your company promote your

161
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,380
organization that are marketing internal

162
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,630
where you're actually trying to build

163
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,950
out your space and get the things you

164
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,210
need in your organization and then

165
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,640
there's the crisis piece which again

166
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,680
everything we're talking about today the

167
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,490
reason it matters and the reason that

168
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:29,230
the traditional PR crisis response

169
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,780
communications world isn't ready for a

170
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,030
cyber event is because a cyber events

171
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,400
not the same traditional corporate

172
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,190
crisis you have a product malfunction

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,299
you have a CEO scandal you have you know

174
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,969
fraud what

175
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,460
those things are they're not going to

176
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,860
act the same as a cyber event and

177
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,919
because they don't act the same the

178
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,510
people that you typically say that team

179
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,690
handles this I don't have to think about

180
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,700
it isn't going to be handling it the

181
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,370
right way they're not going to be

182
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,320
handling it in a way that is adequate to

183
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,050
the type of an event that you are

184
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,659
dealing with in the cyber space it won't

185
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,210
play out the same way a cyber event it

186
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,760
can depending on the size and scope can

187
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,530
take days weeks months before you

188
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,940
actually know what's happening is you're

189
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,549
learning more information over time

190
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,310
whereas a typical traditional corporate

191
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,840
crisis happens quickly and you push

192
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,940
information out and you're done you wash

193
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,710
your hands you move on that doesn't work

194
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,300
in your situation and if somebody on the

195
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,130
communications team is trying to use

196
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,300
that old playbook you're the ones who

197
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,370
are gonna pay the price because they're

198
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,090
gonna bungle the response and that blows

199
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,270
back on you

200
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,250
so hey look at those numbers that are

201
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,580
not actually numbers anymore sorry about

202
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,400
that

203
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,479
so technically this is number four but

204
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,640
you can make it number one if you want

205
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,350
that's fine they're all important so

206
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,030
it's really important to remember

207
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,120
whether it's number one or number four

208
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,650
that everything is in a crisis we say

209
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,660
crisis communications because that's the

210
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,370
industry term that's what we use in the

211
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,780
communications world it's a crisis

212
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,760
everything's a crisis is it a little

213
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,080
crisis or is it a big crisis but it's

214
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,539
important to remember that you don't

215
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,310
respond to them all the same way

216
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,070
sometimes a molehill is really just a

217
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,260
molehill you can make it a mountain by

218
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,820
screwing it up and by acting the wrong

219
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,130
way and responding to it the wrong way

220
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,300
but you don't have to sometimes it

221
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,650
really is a mountain and you need to

222
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,420
treat it like a mountain you can't just

223
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,370
ignore it and pretend it's molehill

224
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,040
because that's when you know you start

225
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,590
pouring the gasoline so it's important

226
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:31,300
to remember that there's different sizes

227
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:34,390
shapes scopes of a crisis event number

228
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,430
two that's nice so I swear to god these

229
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,520
all said 5 1 through 5 when I finished

230
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,919
this the first time around again why

231
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,150
it's important to you is because at the

232
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,770
end of the day no matter who was

233
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,530
responsible for that communications

234
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,630
piece if it goes wrong the whole

235
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,390
response goes wrong the slide we just

236
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,160
saw all of those big headlines all of

237
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,259
those individual dumpster fires

238
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,170
were based on poorly managed responses

239
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,300
that were quite often poor because they

240
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,519
were communicated poorly you know who

241
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,609
didn't get fired the chief marketing

242
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,060
officer the head of communications the

243
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,399
chief PR team lead whoever that is the

244
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,050
person who gets fired is you there's

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,550
always gonna be a scapegoat and it's

246
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,859
very rarely the person who communicates

247
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,229
badly so it's important for you to know

248
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,550
the way that this should be done even if

249
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,670
you're not the one in responsible for

250
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,729
doing it because you are responsible for

251
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,529
putting together the security that

252
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,569
responds for putting together the plan

253
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,279
that responds to all of this so at the

254
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,959
end of the day it is technically going

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,350
to fall back on you so you need to be

256
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,939
able to ask the right questions so

257
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,310
resilience we said before everybody

258
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:44,139
knows this every time I feel silly for

259
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,449
saying this because it's so obvious

260
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,819
there's always somebody who goes oh so

261
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,649
I'm gonna keep saying it we're not

262
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,660
looking at defense we're looking at

263
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,160
resilience we're not looking at are you

264
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,279
secure we're looking at are you

265
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,630
resilient you can build up big walls you

266
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,670
can build up all the defenses you want

267
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,389
someone's getting in them it's not if

268
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,189
it's when

269
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:04,569
bla bla bla again there's always

270
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:07,029
somebody who looks surprised when they

271
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:10,089
hear that if you are that person please

272
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,829
don't nod your head and out yourself so

273
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,329
again it's not about being secure it's

274
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,250
about being resilient it's not about

275
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,079
preventing something forever and ever

276
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,380
and ever it's about making sure that

277
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,050
whatever comes at you you got it you've

278
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,050
got this your organization can handle

279
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:29,439
this and move on it's not just enough to

280
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:32,050
have a resilient network you have to

281
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:34,599
have a resilient company you have to

282
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,300
have a resilient organization you have

283
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,870
to emerge from this event not only with

284
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,579
a clean system but with a business that

285
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,160
is still intact and functioning and that

286
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,779
means you still have customers that want

287
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,120
to give you money for something because

288
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,040
they still trust you you still have

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,889
vendors that want to work with you you

290
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,779
still have that hold client ecosystem

291
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,149
that is willing to let you be a part of

292
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:00,220
it all of those things matter and they

293
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,529
all go back to protecting your

294
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,589
reputation protecting the trust that

295
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,000
that is built on does that make sense

296
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:07,570
you can have a really great clean system

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,370
and that's all

298
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,960
um because you got you know your

299
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,030
networks were super resilient but if no

300
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,460
one trusts you enough to use them it's

301
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,480
not a business it's a hobby hobbies

302
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,590
don't make you a lot of money unless

303
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,120
they're like you know Etsy hobbies which

304
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:23,110
there's probably not a lot of in this

305
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,980
room let's be honest

306
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:29,740
so reputation why does this really

307
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,960
matter brand reputation we're gonna be

308
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,700
on this slide for like five seconds cuz

309
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,400
again there is very little about

310
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,900
reputation that's actually relevant

311
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,760
directly to your day-to-day work but

312
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,350
again this is part of understanding the

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,420
big picture of what everyone else is

314
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,850
focused on so that you can be better at

315
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,099
your jobs you have more awareness brand

316
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,230
reputation is what drives your company's

317
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,540
bottom line it's what makes people give

318
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,970
you money for something products

319
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,920
services advice whatever it is people

320
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,080
pay you for something and you want them

321
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,630
to keep doing that so you have to have a

322
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,670
reputation that says yeah I'm worth your

323
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,100
time in your money reputations are

324
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,620
absolutely built on trust you have to

325
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,420
protect that trust at all costs that has

326
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,730
to be one of the top things that is a

327
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,290
priority regardless of where you are in

328
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,970
your company's system where II where are

329
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,319
you vulnerable this is an important

330
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,780
question to look at when it comes to

331
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,020
reputation we talked a lot and duck show

332
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,829
was just talking about threat modeling

333
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:32,680
risk assessments good cyber security

334
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:34,300
programs are based on risk if they're

335
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,770
not based on risk you're probably just

336
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,000
buying boxes off the shelf and stacking

337
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,380
them on top of each other and hoping you

338
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,440
built a really strong wall out of that

339
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,980
and that's like Legos it's not the same

340
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,260
because trust me

341
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,520
Legos fall apart real fast and when you

342
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,600
step on them so when you look at risks

343
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,880
you have to look at where you're

344
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,830
vulnerable what kinds of data are you

345
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,170
protecting you know people always say

346
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,430
what are your crown jewels and I think

347
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,740
there's more to it than that that's that

348
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,569
kind of overly simplistic but when you

349
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,390
look at the most obvious kinds of

350
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,640
valuable data that you have people

351
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,130
immediately jump to the kinds of things

352
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,410
that you see in headlines do we have

353
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,600
social security numbers maybe not maybe

354
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,579
we do we should probably do we have

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,140
credit card numbers are we a retailer do

356
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,740
we have customer personal data do we

357
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,959
have health information do we have IP

358
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,480
are we a company that has the schematics

359
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,819
to some weapon system or do we have the

360
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,020
secret sauce formula to you know

361
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,970
whatever new thing is out there those

362
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,680
are the obvious answers those are the

363
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,860
obvious things that you protect from a

364
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,989
business priority perspective from a

365
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,540
reputational perspective there's more to

366
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,339
it and there's four things that I like

367
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:50,170
to touch on that I think are important

368
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:52,510
that are always overlooked one you may

369
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,860
have all kinds of things internal to

370
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,050
your systems that you haven't thought

371
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,450
about you may have strategy documents

372
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,779
you may have information about plans

373
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,209
that your company is looking at are you

374
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:07,209
going to be going through an acquisition

375
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,770
are you exploring different options are

376
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,270
you looking at being acquired are you

377
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,620
looking at acquiring someone else what

378
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,839
kind of research have you already done

379
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,140
that's on your system and should be

380
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,850
protected what kinds of market research

381
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,649
have you done have you done research on

382
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,209
competitors in your space because that

383
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,649
kind of information will be valuable to

384
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,060
someone else and will be a little

385
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,589
embarrassing if it gets out there to see

386
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,040
what you really think about all your

387
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:36,640
competitors the two that are the most

388
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,880
often overlooked think about every

389
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,100
single email that you have sent in the

390
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,120
last week maybe the last month but I'm

391
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,230
pretty sure the last week will be

392
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,420
sufficient for my point

393
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,000
now imagine that every single one of

394
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,180
those emails gets published tomorrow no

395
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,250
context no opportunity for you to say oh

396
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,719
no that's not really what I meant no no

397
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,839
that's not really what I think about

398
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,510
that person that has a reputational

399
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,209
impact think about Sony the Sony hack

400
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,250
just all their emails how many people

401
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,170
were super embarrassed after that came

402
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,000
out how much of an impact did that have

403
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,199
on the business when you actually saw

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
what they were talking about and

405
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,339
thinking and decisions they were making

406
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,760
internally that can have a huge impact

407
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:22,990
both personally and professionally the

408
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,899
last one that really really is often the

409
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:28,630
the moment particularly if you are a

410
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,570
vendor if you are a small company if you

411
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,730
are a professional services firm a law

412
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,060
firm a PR company a consulting company a

413
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,540
business

414
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,180
manager a bank anything like that you

415
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,189
are part of someone else's network you

416
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,079
have connections to your clients you

417
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,570
have connections to your customers you

418
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,120
may not be interesting but you have

419
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,450
access to interesting people the most

420
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,760
valuable thing that you may offer

421
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,310
someone else is access to a bigger fish

422
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,290
and the last thing that you want to do

423
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,500
if you're worried about protecting trust

424
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,439
and having people trust you as a vendor

425
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,580
who offers a similar service to ten

426
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,460
other companies although obviously

427
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:13,870
superior but they trust you because they

428
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,450
pick you one of the best ways to reach

429
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,770
that trust and to harm that relationship

430
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,040
and to convince someone they should go

431
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,860
use the other guy is to let a bad actor

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,150
into their system through your door you

433
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,740
never want to be the weak link in the

434
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,600
ecosystem and it's all an ecosystem

435
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,580
these days there's very very little

436
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,470
one-off here and there it's all an

437
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,940
ecosystem you hear everything about

438
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,040
third-party breaches you know the most

439
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,090
obvious is target who would have thought

440
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,890
there was anything interesting in an

441
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,330
HVAC vendor system turns out there

442
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,150
wasn't except there was a door into

443
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,030
target which was pretty interesting so

444
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,550
just remember that that access is

445
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,350
something that has to be protected so

446
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,939
there's a lot more that goes into risk

447
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,300
assessments and identifying

448
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,400
vulnerabilities than just how many users

449
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,959
do I have how many endpoints are there

450
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,500
like you have to think about this from

451
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,510
the full business perspective so what

452
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,130
can you do this is reputational

453
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,589
resilience and there's really three

454
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,050
parts here and again these are important

455
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,480
for you to understand even if they

456
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,310
aren't directly in your area of

457
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,290
responsibility these may not directly be

458
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,300
your AOR but there is somebody who

459
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,849
should be asking these questions and

460
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,589
doing these things and because you are

461
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,300
going to be ultimately responsible for

462
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,980
how well they do them you need to be

463
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,590
able to ask the right questions you need

464
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,150
to know what they should be doing so you

465
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:35,409
can make sure you're protected by them

466
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,960
doing it right so plan train respond

467
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,810
pretty basic in the incident response

468
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,880
space obviously you plan if you don't

469
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,980
train to it your planning doesn't count

470
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,210
and you have to actually respond you can

471
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,410
have a really cool plan on the shelf but

472
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,770
if you throw it out the window who cares

473
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,810
you have to

474
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,510
actually execute that plan appropriately

475
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,440
we're gonna talk a little bit here this

476
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,140
is we're gonna spend a little bit more

477
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,840
of your time and I have no sense of

478
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,980
timing where we are I guess okay so this

479
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,470
right here I think is one of the more

480
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,140
important places to spend a little time

481
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,620
so there are three pieces to putting

482
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,500
together a good plan a good plan that

483
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,270
takes into account reputation that takes

484
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,400
into account the priorities of the other

485
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,440
parts your organization and it starts

486
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,850
with having the right team who needs to

487
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,930
be in the room who besides just your

488
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:28,209
small data security focused team needs

489
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,220
to be a part of the decisions that are

490
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,920
made about how your organization's gonna

491
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,740
respond you need to know these people

492
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,470
ahead of time you need to know who they

493
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,540
are how to reach them how to reach them

494
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,880
on a back-up plan because if all of your

495
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,460
communications system is compromised you

496
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,440
can't pick up the phone and call

497
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,650
somebody how are they going to know they

498
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,320
need to show up so when you think about

499
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,490
across an organization who needs to be a

500
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,439
part of this team obviously you've got

501
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,860
IT you've got your CIO you've got your C

502
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,990
so you need to have obviously

503
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,850
communications obviously because

504
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,610
somewhere you're gonna have to talk to

505
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,379
somebody about something and you need to

506
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,419
do that in the right way so you need to

507
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,180
communicate communications rep you need

508
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,660
legal because as we know there's about

509
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,810
150 million different overlapping

510
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,150
regulations and compliance requirements

511
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,649
and every contract you sign may or may

512
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,320
not have some variation of a

513
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,480
notification clause in it and you need

514
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,780
to make sure you are moving through that

515
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,190
maze the right way you need to make sure

516
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,700
that you are checking all those

517
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,930
necessary legal boxes and I'm not gonna

518
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,550
go on and on about how important your

519
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,140
lawyer is but they're super important so

520
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:49,360
you need your lawyer you need HR quite

521
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,550
honestly because you need to be able to

522
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,189
communicate internally you need to be

523
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,629
able to communicate internally among the

524
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,200
employees your organization whether

525
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,520
there's five of you or five thousand

526
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,330
somewhere information has to be

527
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,740
exchanged so that

528
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,179
everyone's aware of what's going on to

529
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,340
the extent that they need to be and

530
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,760
anytime you're communicating like that

531
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,649
internally to employees to staff HR

532
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,600
needs to be involved because that's

533
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,580
really in their world whether or not

534
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,590
they're actually going to compose any of

535
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,720
that or hit Send on any of those

536
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,730
communications totally irrelevant they

537
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,780
need to be a part of that conversation

538
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,250
so you're probably going to have

539
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,230
depending on your organization how

540
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,900
you're structured different business

541
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,140
units someone in charge of different

542
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,840
regions different audiences different

543
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,240
customer base you need to think about

544
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,340
who those people are gonna be ahead of

545
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,710
time and you need to know who they are

546
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,139
and you need to have updated information

547
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,730
so that if some guys switched into a new

548
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,560
job or left your company and went

549
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,170
somewhere else cuz lord knows there's

550
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,270
enough transition around this industry

551
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,650
you need to know who that person is now

552
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,510
god forbid something break you need

553
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,800
someone at midnight and you realize they

554
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,970
don't work for your company anymore and

555
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,070
then you have to spend the entire next

556
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,320
day figuring out who works there now not

557
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,300
helpful so you need your team and you

558
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,389
need to know roles and responsibilities

559
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,129
and you need to have this ironed out

560
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,600
ahead of time I know that sounds silly

561
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,980
because obviously when you all get in

562
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,070
the same room everybody knows what legal

563
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,680
does everyone knows what PR does but

564
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,899
when it comes to an actual crisis event

565
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,370
an event that is significant enough that

566
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,540
it requires all these people in the room

567
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:27,280
together you were gonna have streamlined

568
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,590
processes you're not gonna go through

569
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,480
the same 12 people have to sign off on

570
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,459
every sentence before we say it to

571
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,120
anybody because that's just gonna tank

572
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,490
you from the start

573
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,750
you have to know what that approval

574
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,980
chain is gonna look like you have to

575
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,660
know who's gonna be in charge of getting

576
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,490
information who's gonna be in charge of

577
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,140
vetting information who's gonna be in

578
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,640
charge of taking that information and

579
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,740
writing it in English so that someone

580
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,960
else can understand that all of those

581
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,890
things have to be ironed out ahead of

582
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,050
time and one of the big reasons is that

583
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,410
you're gonna build tools this is

584
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:01,990
something ahead of time that saves so

585
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,540
much time because when when something

586
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:08,170
occurs and you all know this when

587
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,330
there's an event all the rules although

588
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,010
we play nice together as a team

589
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,320
everything's nice and orderly it goes

590
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,890
flying out the window nobody cares

591
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,210
anymore

592
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,980
everyone's running around trying to

593
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,020
figure out what's happening what's going

594
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,270
on is it my fault I hope it's not my

595
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,280
fault let me make sure it's not my fault

596
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:26,410
so you lose a little bit about that you

597
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,610
know raw team spirit kind of thing

598
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,420
because everyone wants make sure they're

599
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,689
not the one taking the fall for

600
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,450
something so when you think about that

601
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,970
environment that fog of war if you will

602
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,030
where it's just all a little fuzzy what

603
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,540
can you do ahead of time that will help

604
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,160
you make good decisions in that space

605
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,680
what will help you make objective

606
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,170
decisions that are good for your company

607
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,470
based on the plan that you've built and

608
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:56,020
not decisions that are based on emotions

609
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,550
and fear and uncertainty because that's

610
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,860
what's gonna drive the train if you

611
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:01,180
haven't already done this if you haven't

612
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,520
already built these tools and these

613
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,710
reference points to say here are the

614
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,510
things that I need who do I need to talk

615
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,470
to let me look at you know I'll talk

616
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,330
about a couple of the tools here a

617
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,830
minute who do I need to talk to what do

618
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,020
we need to do what do we need to monitor

619
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,250
let me get those things done ahead of

620
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,440
time so that I can pull them off the

621
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:21,250
shelf look at them and start moving down

622
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,650
that road as opposed to let me think

623
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,600
what sounds important I don't know who's

624
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,630
in that job is there somebody is this

625
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,760
relevant to you know this business unit

626
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,410
you've already made those decisions so

627
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,990
you know and you can compare and it

628
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,880
becomes a much more objective exercise

629
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,030
that's when you make good decisions and

630
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,640
not scary subjective decisions so

631
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,389
anything that'll help you save time

632
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,090
think about the kinds of decisions

633
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,490
you're gonna have to make in that moment

634
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,050
what do we know so ahead of time roles

635
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,570
and responsibilities whose job is it to

636
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,690
figure out what you really know who do

637
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:58,179
we need to tell so ahead of time what

638
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,280
can you build that will help you

639
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,110
identify the full universe of people

640
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,860
that you may potentially have to talk to

641
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,060
and identify the types of information

642
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,260
they will need and the times you will

643
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,990
have to talk to them that's a

644
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:13,450
stakeholder analysis quite possibly not

645
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,890
in your world if it is in your world I'm

646
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,170
kind of sorry for your job description

647
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,970
but somebody in your company should have

648
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,790
been doing this they should have a

649
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,410
stakeholder analysis from any other type

650
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,629
of communications planning that they've

651
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,910
done but making sure it's tailored to an

652
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,750
actual cyber event is key so a

653
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,690
stakeholder now

654
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,720
everybody inside your company not to the

655
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,340
individual but to the function that you

656
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,780
will need to tell and everybody outside

657
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,419
your company who has a stake and what

658
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,780
happens to you investors the board the

659
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,980
media business partners vendors all of

660
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,649
these people have to be included

661
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,600
internally executives well are they you

662
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,890
know do you get subgroups within this do

663
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,240
you have executives who are responsible

664
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,530
for different regions of the world

665
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,120
they're gonna need different information

666
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,810
than someone else do you have a sales

667
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,520
team do you have a customer service

668
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,620
center is there somewhere where

669
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,330
everyone's gonna start calling when they

670
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,469
figured out something happens someone's

671
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,610
got to think about what those people are

672
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,710
gonna say when they answer the phone

673
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:09,969
they're the point into the sphere you

674
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,630
got to make sure they're set up for

675
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,730
success and to protect you so that big

676
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,740
stakeholder analysis becomes essentially

677
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,820
a big grid and a reference point you

678
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,350
pull it off the shelf

679
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,850
you know the facts that you have of the

680
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,070
situation at hand and you say okay based

681
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,570
on what we know here's what we need to

682
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,889
talk here's who we need to talk to and

683
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,240
based on the information we've gathered

684
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,980
here's the best way to talk to them

685
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,210
here are the channels that exist for

686
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,830
communicating with these groups and

687
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,330
here's who's responsible for it

688
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,320
you've already made those decisions

689
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,899
because you've already put in the time

690
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,250
that will save you the time and help you

691
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,830
make those decisions and not forget

692
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,720
anybody who needs this information

693
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,850
another important tool goes back to the

694
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,310
mole hills and mountains conversation

695
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,530
you need to have an a scale an impact

696
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,610
scale that is appropriate for your

697
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,290
organization there's no

698
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,000
one-size-fits-all because something that

699
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,800
impacts you may not impact someone else

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,410
in the same way but you need to have

701
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,000
that built out say one through five what

702
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,520
counts as a one what counts as a two

703
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,410
three four five specifically based on

704
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,150
the impact your organization and at each

705
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,370
of those points how are you supposed to

706
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,470
respond who needs to be part of the

707
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,810
conversation at each of those increasing

708
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,810
levels and importance once you have that

709
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,940
you can say again what do I know what do

710
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,590
I know now what is the potential for

711
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,150
what this could become but what is it

712
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,760
actually right now not guessing not

713
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,290
speculating and based on that where does

714
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,090
it fall on this scale that's gonna

715
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,639
determine how you respond doing that

716
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,050
ahead of time makes this a

717
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,930
decision-making exercise not an

718
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:38,560
information gathering exercise it makes

719
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:40,480
objective decisions better so your team

720
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,040
your tools and your to-do list this is

721
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,540
the what needs to get done this

722
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,030
where you line up all those things that

723
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,620
you have to do you have to somebody has

724
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,879
to monitor the media so that you have a

725
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,199
heads up if there's any kind of leak

726
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,690
coming in someone has to be on social

727
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,310
media someone has to be gathering

728
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,960
information someone has to be starting

729
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,860
to draft responses someone has to put

730
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,720
together a holding statement which again

731
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,189
in communication circles quite often

732
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,680
people still don't understand what a

733
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,200
holding statement is it sounds silly but

734
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,210
it will harden me save your ass more

735
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,940
often than not it is literally three or

736
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,080
four sentences that say nothing

737
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,450
literally nothing because you probably

738
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,800
don't know anything all you do is

739
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,570
acknowledge there's a thing and you're

740
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,550
working on it and we got this we'll get

741
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,950
back to you with more information

742
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,389
everybody knows at least one person who

743
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,720
can talk for 20 minutes without saying

744
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,950
anything probably more than one person

745
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,860
there's probably some in this room all

746
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,420
your heads just turned so that is a

747
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,939
holding statement it is literally

748
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,260
nothing but in enough words to where if

749
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,840
something gets out before you're ready

750
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,060
to talk about it you have an answer you

751
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,760
put out words that make people respond

752
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,950
to you rather than you having to respond

753
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,450
to other people from a reputational

754
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,100
communications perspective it lets you

755
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,170
continue driving the train even if you

756
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,580
don't know where you're going it keeps

757
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,070
you in control of the situation

758
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,080
so that's on your to-do list this is a

759
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,179
checklist this is so you say okay what

760
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,620
do we have to do and again it makes

761
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:08,170
objective decisions faster you look at

762
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,459
is there anybody going do we have any

763
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,800
folks speaking at a conference this

764
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,890
weekend do we have anybody doing a

765
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,270
webinar on security this afternoon all

766
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,650
those kinds of things that you might

767
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,030
want to pull back on you might want to

768
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,280
see what's in the pipeline see if you

769
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,600
need to adjust base to your situation is

770
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,420
somebody sitting down for an interview

771
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,639
with Forbes and we need to maybe adjust

772
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,190
some of their talking points things like

773
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,540
that that will help you again make good

774
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,000
decisions keep everything under control

775
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,879
and not just make it worse by losing

776
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,940
control of the edges so your team your

777
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,780
tools and your to-do-list

778
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,060
majority of this can be done ahead of

779
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,610
time I always say that about 80% of what

780
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,770
you need to communicate effectively in

781
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,750
the event of an incident can be done

782
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,280
ahead of time and if you've done it

783
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,740
ahead of time then you are actually

784
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,330
going to be better when you have to pull

785
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,889
that trigger and actually implement that

786
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,370
plan

787
00:28:55,889 --> 00:29:02,529
otherwise all bets are off good luck and

788
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:05,139
training this is also very important I

789
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:07,840
love sports metaphors I hope that works

790
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:09,158
here the usually about half the audience

791
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,509
is like oh ok and the other half is like

792
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,909
oh so bear with me nobody shows up cold

793
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:17,889
on game day you take a football team you

794
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:20,159
don't all say great welcome to the team

795
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:22,120
here's your playbook see you Sunday and

796
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,200
then you all show up and like start

797
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,120
introducing yourselves to each other

798
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,190
right before kickoff that's not how that

799
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,610
works you practice you practice practice

800
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,519
practice

801
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:33,189
because you have to know what everyone

802
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,990
else on that team is doing you have to

803
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,149
know what they're thinking what their

804
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,399
priorities are where they're going so

805
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:41,500
that you can actually connect and make

806
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,709
that work you know your quarterback

807
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,259
needs to know not only what he or she is

808
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,730
doing they have to know what the wide

809
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,889
receivers doing so that they can

810
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,870
actually connect and it has to be

811
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:56,439
predictable there's muscle memory

812
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:58,989
involved in training the way that you

813
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,090
develop good muscle memory is that you

814
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,710
train in different ways every time

815
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,509
there's a training it doesn't have to be

816
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,769
this giant shut down the company for a

817
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:10,750
day realistic role playing thing it

818
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:13,179
doesn't always have to be like that that

819
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,940
is important that is in a very important

820
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:18,700
event but you don't have to do that so

821
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,250
often that it becomes a bother sometimes

822
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,110
it helps to just sit down and say all

823
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,309
right here's the script here's how this

824
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,149
is gonna go does everyone note their

825
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:29,559
role is okay great check see in a corner

826
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:31,120
then you know who the people are what

827
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,799
they're doing everyone's made sure

828
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,508
they're you know contact information is

829
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,519
up-to-date you can run anything in

830
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,769
between that big medium small whatever

831
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,440
your objectives are you can change how

832
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:43,509
you train but it's important to use

833
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,669
realistic scenarios every training

834
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,929
shouldn't be a bunch of executives

835
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:48,399
sitting around the conference table

836
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,570
reading from a script because no one's

837
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,678
getting anything out of that all the

838
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,379
time it's an important ad to have

839
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,700
injections a little a little inject into

840
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,799
the middle assyrian area of your

841
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,850
scenario i do training workshops on this

842
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,009
for different folks and this is always

843
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,059
one of the my favorite pieces because

844
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:05,740
you really get to screw with people's

845
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:07,629
heads and that's kind of the whole point

846
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,190
of training is to see where your playing

847
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:09,580
is weak and to see where your people are

848
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,920
unex

849
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,659
respecting where they're not expecting

850
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,710
something to change because they have to

851
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,750
be ready to roll with that

852
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,030
so in the middle of an exercise

853
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,360
everything's going along all of a sudden

854
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,040
you pop in and you say hey I just saw

855
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,240
this tweet from Brian crabs he mentioned

856
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,690
our company he doesn't know what's going

857
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,060
on but he heard there's a thing and then

858
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:33,010
you just step back and watch because

859
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,020
it's awesome I mean it's awesome if you

860
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,510
think that's funny I think it's funny so

861
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,560
that's a good way to test your plan and

862
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,270
see if people are ready to think on

863
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,909
their feet because this isn't science

864
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,080
we're doing our best to make it as

865
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,120
scientific and is methodical and it's

866
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,360
formulaic as possible but at the end of

867
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,250
the day it's art it's just art because

868
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,110
you have to feel your way through it to

869
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,400
do it right and it's gonna change all

870
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,219
the time and you have to be ready for

871
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,390
that understanding all the roles we

872
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,530
talked about this this is important this

873
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,670
is where everyone on your team needs to

874
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,670
understand what everyone else on your

875
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:06,190
team is doing so that they can more

876
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:09,790
effectively handle their

877
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,400
responsibilities in this unknown

878
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,690
situation when everything is in flux you

879
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
have to know where everyone else is

880
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,320
moving around you so that you can make

881
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,930
the best decisions possible within that

882
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,610
context so I can you tell him visual

883
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,660
like I've drawn this whole thing up here

884
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,120
I hope you can see it it's in the air

885
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,950
but everyone's got their own little

886
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,389
place where they're spinning and doing

887
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,830
the things they're responsible for and

888
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,300
they know what they are because you've

889
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,250
built them ahead of time you've told

890
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,169
them what they are and everyone knows

891
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,850
what everyone else is doing even if

892
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,560
they're not watching it because you've

893
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,060
trained to it and you understand how

894
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,520
you're all working together that's

895
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,639
important don't underestimate the power

896
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,160
of social media most people don't but

897
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,660
you'd be surprised as you go farther and

898
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,100
farther up the food chain in a company

899
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,610
how often people really like to

900
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,110
underestimate the power of social media

901
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,090
hopefully there will come a point 20 30

902
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,370
years from now where that's not the case

903
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,260
anymore God willing it's sooner but

904
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:05,199
right now people still underestimate

905
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,330
social media the things in the

906
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,670
traditional crisis communications world

907
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,590
where I used to say it's a 24-hour news

908
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:13,810
cycle you got to get stuff out there now

909
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,419
it's about a 60 second news cycle things

910
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,800
fly that's why that holding statement is

911
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,680
so important because the minute

912
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,300
something gets out there it's like

913
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,080
throwing it into a system and watching

914
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,940
it just gets whooshed

915
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,100
way out of your hands you lose control

916
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,960
over it so you need to know when

917
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,699
something's coming at you and you need

918
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,010
to be ready to push something back at it

919
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,100
quickly so you feed that constant

920
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,480
machine or it's going to feed on you all

921
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,678
the rumors are gonna get out there

922
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,750
before you have a chance to put out

923
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,490
facts all the people who are speculating

924
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,440
about oh my god what you did what you

925
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,090
didn't I heard this I heard that he's

926
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,279
gonna get out there and one of the

927
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,699
easiest ways for something to leak is a

928
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,340
completely innocuous social media post

929
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,110
some of my favorites are you know oh hey

930
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,610
that's really funny my buddy John came

931
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,479
here I had showed up on Tuesday we

932
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,908
weren't supposed to have lunch until

933
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,220
Wednesday that's funny yeah well John

934
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:04,450
works for the forensics company he's

935
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,980
there checking out your system to see

936
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,360
what just happened to it and everyone

937
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,399
knows where John works so now they all

938
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,440
know that you have an incident doesn't

939
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,359
take a lot of dot connecting from

940
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,980
someone who knows what the dots are to

941
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,940
be able to put those kinds of pieces

942
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:21,790
together and to then ask so it all come

943
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,099
together as a tweet a question a phone

944
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,020
call from somebody who's like hey this

945
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:28,030
looks funny is there a thing here and it

946
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,800
turns out there is a thing there but you

947
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,210
weren't ready to talk about it so you

948
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,339
have to be ready for that kind of thing

949
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,010
like hey mom I'm not gonna be able to

950
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:37,779
make it home for dinner on Sunday night

951
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,089
because I have to work all weekend

952
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,980
mom posts on Facebook oh that's too bad

953
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:43,418
Johnny can't come home for dinner on

954
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,760
Sunday he has to work all weekend

955
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,168
something bigs going on at work you know

956
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,460
that's really cute except mom's probably

957
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,210
not just talking to a bunch of other

958
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,280
like 80 year old moms so or however old

959
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:58,480
all your moms are which unfortunately

960
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,400
may be my age which is not 80 so you

961
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,780
have to think about all those kinds of

962
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
pieces and again those may not be your

963
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,470
exact responsibilities but you need to

964
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,230
understand that those are considerations

965
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,330
that somebody has to be thinking about

966
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,830
and if they're not again it has the

967
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:15,009
potential to blow back on you not them

968
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:18,700
so we train and we train and we train

969
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:20,770
and when we respond we make sure that

970
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,080
we've taken this great plan that we

971
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,240
train to it so well and that we are

972
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,450
actually executing that plan in an

973
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,450
effective way it's really hard to tell

974
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,069
without being a fly on the wall what has

975
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,160
driven decisions from some of these

976
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:36,850
companies that communicated so badly you

977
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,009
don't know

978
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,940
did you get bad advice did you have a

979
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,400
bad plan

980
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,470
or did you just choose to ignore all of

981
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,060
it and you know somewhere there was a

982
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,140
CEO was like oh I'm just gonna fly by

983
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,029
the seat of my pants I have good

984
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,609
instincts for this well you you don't

985
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,830
always so that's that's why you have a

986
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:56,200
plan in the first place there are

987
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,000
important rules of thumb when it comes

988
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,589
to response every response is gonna be

989
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,730
different and I can't stand up here and

990
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,320
tell you these are the five things that

991
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,970
you have to have in every single

992
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,530
response because it will change it

993
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,140
depends on the audiences on the

994
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,080
specifics of the incident and it depends

995
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,779
on who your company is and and what you

996
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,220
are trying to protect ultimately the

997
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,770
most important thing to remember your

998
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,589
objective again from the broader

999
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:23,230
business perspective relationship

1000
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,060
management matters this is the again

1001
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,830
this isn't the forensics this isn't that

1002
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,779
how do we you know mitigate this threat

1003
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:31,330
how do we get our networks clean that's

1004
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,830
all going on anyway the other piece that

1005
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,509
somebody else should be worrying about

1006
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,960
is managing your relationships through

1007
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,760
this event that has to stay front of

1008
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,880
mind as this is happening and based on

1009
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,550
that you respond to incidents Pacific's

1010
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,620
you only talk about what you know you

1011
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,850
don't guess guessing is where you have a

1012
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,500
problem and this is particularly

1013
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,630
relevant to I think most of the people

1014
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,140
in this room whether you are part of the

1015
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:58,300
response team or not there's often

1016
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,339
especially these days a lot of pressure

1017
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,440
to have answers and you're not always

1018
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,930
gonna have the answers especially not in

1019
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,870
the beginning and most of the timelines

1020
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,210
for notification are gonna hit before

1021
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,220
you know anything or before you know

1022
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,030
everything especially before you know

1023
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,919
everything you may not even know

1024
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,200
anything you just know like went

1025
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,360
down that's it that's all I got but it's

1026
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,040
important that wherever you fall in that

1027
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,710
food chain wherever you sit in this

1028
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,230
ecosystem when you own the information

1029
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,210
that someone else needs that you are

1030
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,180
honest about what you know and that you

1031
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,620
don't guess some of the biggest problems

1032
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,399
you see are when companies and

1033
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:38,880
organizations put out statements saying

1034
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,440
this is what happened and they're wrong

1035
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,210
they come back a week or two later and

1036
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,830
they say just kidding it's bigger than

1037
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,760
that oh just kidding it's big oh wait

1038
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,960
now it includes all this other

1039
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,120
information sorry we didn't know

1040
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,650
anything it turns out but they guessed

1041
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,640
and

1042
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,819
you don't know if that's because

1043
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,049
somebody who knew they didn't know

1044
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:59,220
anything felt pressured to say Oh

1045
00:37:57,049 --> 00:38:01,020
definitively this is the answer this is

1046
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,549
what we know and then that worked its

1047
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,720
way up to that statement that went out

1048
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:10,170
or if somebody felt obligated to present

1049
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,669
information in a more definitive way you

1050
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,289
don't know again unless you're inside a

1051
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,109
company but make sure that wherever you

1052
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:18,420
are in that chain you are passing along

1053
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:19,740
accurate information you're not guessing

1054
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,920
you're not speculating this is one of

1055
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,649
the biggest problems that causes legal

1056
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,039
liability that causes extended news

1057
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,529
stories one headline turns into 10 15 20

1058
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:35,430
because you're guessing that's really

1059
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:36,599
important audiences this is part of what

1060
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,029
we talked about in building those tools

1061
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,650
in that stakeholder analysis you're

1062
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:42,930
gonna have audiences that you have to

1063
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,130
talk to there's gonna be compliance

1064
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,078
requirements there's gonna be

1065
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,660
notification requirements that you are

1066
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:53,569
bound to 72 for 72 hour notifications

1067
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,520
from hick your new regulation du jour

1068
00:38:53,569 --> 00:38:59,369
gdpr says this California's new law says

1069
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,170
this New York's DFS regulation says this

1070
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,579
like there's this enormous patchwork

1071
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,420
quilt that just sucks to try and dig

1072
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,420
through and that's why you have really

1073
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,430
good lawyers they will tell you who you

1074
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,710
have to talk to based on all of your

1075
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,089
vendor contracts who do you have to talk

1076
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,270
to some of them you'll have to talk to

1077
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:16,529
in 72 hours some of them you won't but

1078
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,059
some of them you will for certain

1079
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:19,549
situations but not for others so someone

1080
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,880
has to help you navigate that legal

1081
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:27,450
requirement everyone else is a gray area

1082
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,420
everyone else is a who should I tell not

1083
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:33,629
who I have to tell but who should I tell

1084
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,760
who is going to be so much happier in

1085
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,950
this situation if they hear it from me

1086
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,869
directly not if they read about it

1087
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,299
somewhere else or if they hear a rumor

1088
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:43,829
from someone else that's a gray area and

1089
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,839
that's part of what you try and sort

1090
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:48,240
through in that analysis piece ahead of

1091
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,130
time so that you know here all of my

1092
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,538
gray area people and organizations

1093
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,339
stakeholders who do I have to talk to

1094
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:59,119
based on the facts of this situation and

1095
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,960
that helps you navigate that situation

1096
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,549
drafting messaging and delivering

1097
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,910
appropriately this is the what do you

1098
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,920
see

1099
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,600
your lawyer will tell you who you have

1100
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,180
to talk to and what you technically have

1101
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,930
to tell them my job is to tell you how

1102
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,609
to say it so that that person actually

1103
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,810
takes the information and appreciates

1104
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,480
the information I mean nobody

1105
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,460
appreciates this kind of information but

1106
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,560
you can say something like a lawyer to

1107
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,720
me and I'm gonna want to like punch you

1108
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,100
in the face for saying it or you can say

1109
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,569
something like a functional human being

1110
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,759
gonna be like oh that sucks

1111
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:33,280
okay keep you posted there's a big

1112
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,920
difference in that reaction and that

1113
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,660
plays out in the broader company space

1114
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,710
too with all whoever you're talking to

1115
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,690
whether you're telling companies or

1116
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,690
board members or investors or partners

1117
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:46,240
whoever that is telling people like a

1118
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,410
human makes a really big difference and

1119
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,000
goes a long way towards not just

1120
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,040
generally making everyone mad at you

1121
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,270
because angry people like to sue you and

1122
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,570
that makes this whole thing blow out of

1123
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:58,600
proportion then you would hear a Legally

1124
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,160
Blonde fan by any chance you know anger

1125
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,120
people don't kill their husbands it's

1126
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,160
kind of the same thing angry people

1127
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,509
don't see you in large large numbers so

1128
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,830
we try really hard to manage those

1129
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:09,130
relationships and keep everyone from

1130
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:11,259
like hating you in mass expectations is

1131
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:13,000
a big piece here I'm clearly pointing at

1132
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,260
this because I did learn that I should

1133
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,670
not walk over there and point at manage

1134
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,370
expectations so I'm trying really hard

1135
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,100
to stay right here managing expectations

1136
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,509
is the key and we've touched on it and

1137
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,540
basically every piece that we talked

1138
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:28,750
about here managing expectations because

1139
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:31,240
it's a cyber event means that you're

1140
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,620
making sure from the very first time you

1141
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,319
open your mouth or you write a letter or

1142
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,270
you talk or notify anyone that you are

1143
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,430
managing their expectations to the fact

1144
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,950
that this isn't the end this is just the

1145
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,450
beginning but you've got it it's under

1146
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,470
control you have the right people and

1147
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,210
you're doing the right things to figure

1148
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:48,520
out what happened to fix it and to make

1149
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,230
sure it doesn't happen again but you're

1150
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,670
making sure that they understand there

1151
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:55,690
will be additional information that

1152
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,790
comes out over time that this is not the

1153
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,890
final answer and that's the big mistake

1154
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,620
that I was referencing before with

1155
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:06,520
companies you know you look at the big

1156
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,589
OPM breach from a few years ago no no it

1157
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,450
was just this many and then a week later

1158
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,520
they came out and said well maybe it was

1159
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,460
like 10 million then they came out later

1160
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,470
maybe

1161
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,730
like 17 million and then somebody

1162
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,020
testified in front of Congress and it

1163
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,250
was a different number and then the

1164
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,230
final number was even bigger than that

1165
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,530
yeah that person lost their job because

1166
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:27,410
they guessed too much you want to make

1167
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:31,099
sure again in the beginning that you are

1168
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,799
setting up that expectation so that when

1169
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:35,540
you have updated information

1170
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,440
somebody says thanks for the update and

1171
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,710
not why are you changing your story it's

1172
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,599
a very nuanced distinction but it means

1173
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,930
the world when it comes to managing your

1174
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,700
reputation and preserving trust you want

1175
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,950
people to trust you and to trust that

1176
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,750
what you're saying is credible and if

1177
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,609
the answer is I don't know anything yet

1178
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,470
you tell them that they're gonna believe

1179
00:42:55,609 --> 00:43:01,839
you because they you don't know anything

1180
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:04,848
you want to make sure that you are

1181
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,339
executing this plan in a way that

1182
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:08,630
actually holds on to that piece this is

1183
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:10,900
one of the biggest pieces that gets

1184
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,130
dropped if you're just relying on

1185
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,320
somebody else to do this who's using the

1186
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,790
wrong playbook your PlayBook in the

1187
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,280
cyber space has to manage those

1188
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,740
expectations more carefully than just

1189
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,940
about any other time so that's a big

1190
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,348
piece to hold on to all right we're

1191
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,300
gonna go through a couple of fun

1192
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:31,099
examples here good the bad and ugly and

1193
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,930
I acknowledge this needs to be seriously

1194
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,280
updated because pretty much every time

1195
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,140
you blink there's like seven more things

1196
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,220
that could go up here so some of these

1197
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,029
are gonna be a little old but they will

1198
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:44,299
hold out for a reason on here so the

1199
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,280
good yay Home Depot not new anymore

1200
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,670
feels like it happened 200 years ago it

1201
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,720
didn't it was not a hundred years ago

1202
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,839
we're gonna start with that one because

1203
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,270
they they came right on the heels of

1204
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,570
target which is sort of one of the first

1205
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:01,670
big like what is this data breach thing

1206
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,440
moments for the general public

1207
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,180
Home Depot came right after them so they

1208
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,380
had the benefit of not being first which

1209
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:11,509
is nice the best quote I heard at a New

1210
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,520
York conference recently was the early

1211
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:16,010
bird gets the worm but the second Mouse

1212
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,349
gets the cheese Home Depot was the

1213
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:22,790
second Mouse target was the first Mouse

1214
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:26,450
so Home Depot came out and they didn't

1215
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,250
say here's what happened they didn't say

1216
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,629
we have our hands wrapped around this we

1217
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:33,280
know what happened here's what it is

1218
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:35,569
we're fixing it they balanced right

1219
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,480
accurate correct information

1220
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:39,770
and saying something really fast again

1221
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,819
it's that statement that says lots of

1222
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,079
things really fast but doesn't actually

1223
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:44,058
say anything wrong because it doesn't

1224
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,589
actually say anything that's important

1225
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,720
and they reached out to people quickly

1226
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,069
they kept the information flowing they

1227
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,290
kept everyone updated throughout the

1228
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:54,380
process and they worked and made changes

1229
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,210
to start restoring trust quickly that

1230
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,260
helped there's still an example we still

1231
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,790
talk about them it was a thing that

1232
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,049
happened but they're on the good end of

1233
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:05,540
that because they manage relationships

1234
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:07,730
well in a different way Maersk the

1235
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,259
global shipping company everywhere

1236
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,280
touches everything probably ships

1237
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,059
everything you've ever heard ever

1238
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:17,059
touched yourselves all around the world

1239
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:19,910
completely completely shut down by not

1240
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:21,109
Patea completely lost everything like

1241
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,879
there's some great articles out there

1242
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:24,529
giving really interesting color that's

1243
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,549
just fascinating assuming you weren't

1244
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,740
the ones sitting in the middle of it

1245
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:29,030
about how they handled it from a

1246
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,009
communications perspective from a

1247
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:35,030
reputation perspective they were

1248
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:38,210
brilliant because they focused on their

1249
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:41,980
customers they prioritized customer

1250
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:45,410
relationships and execution if you will

1251
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:48,049
they put out commander intent so we call

1252
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,950
it the the executive side here's how

1253
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:51,140
this is gonna go

1254
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,578
we are delegating authority because we

1255
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,828
can't tell you anything ourselves

1256
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:58,520
because we're just on our asses right

1257
00:45:54,829 --> 00:46:00,650
now but they sent out authority to

1258
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,329
everyone at every port in every little

1259
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,240
Inn point that they worked with and said

1260
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:10,700
figure it out don't care how don't care

1261
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:12,979
what it costs just do it so you you had

1262
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,339
people at ports all around the world

1263
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:19,220
points of entry all around the world

1264
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:21,230
using sticky notes using handwritten

1265
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,700
Ledger's to try and figure out what was

1266
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,250
in trucks what was going places using

1267
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,859
social media to communicate and they

1268
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,079
lost a ton of money ton of money

1269
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:32,328
hundreds of millions of dollars but the

1270
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,040
loyalty they gained from their customer

1271
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:38,240
base by handling it the way they did

1272
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,980
will pay off in spades those are going

1273
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,339
to be customers for life and life

1274
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,320
in life it's a it's that reputation

1275
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:48,950
piece and thinking about that the way

1276
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,960
they handled it is just it's textbook of

1277
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,609
how you put the right priorities first

1278
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,050
so they had their team figuring it all

1279
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,790
out cleaning everything up trying to get

1280
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,840
back on line and at the same time you

1281
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,830
had people actually out there on the

1282
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:03,790
ground making things work

1283
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:07,220
anyway it was amazing so the bad the bad

1284
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:09,650
yahoo make up your minds what happens

1285
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:14,000
how much happens this is one where you

1286
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:15,320
clearly just kept changing the story it

1287
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,430
just kept getting bigger and it kept

1288
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,690
getting worse and there was no

1289
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,399
expectation that it was gonna get worse

1290
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,680
cuz every time it was no here's what

1291
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,390
happened nope okay no for real this is

1292
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,220
what okay sorry wait for real this is

1293
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,859
really really what happens nobody

1294
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,230
believes you then they lost valuation

1295
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:32,480
when you know they're a murderer when

1296
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,700
they were required they've they did not

1297
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,070
balance anything about right and fast

1298
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,290
they just shot out the door guessed at

1299
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,730
numbers they were wrong they kept

1300
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,830
digging because it kept happening over

1301
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,540
and over and over again expectations

1302
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:48,470
were not managed at all that this might

1303
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:50,359
change and one of my favorite ones their

1304
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:52,009
response to what we're gonna do about

1305
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:54,890
this was you guys should change your

1306
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,900
passwords Thanks

1307
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:59,839
like it's like the cyber version of

1308
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,609
super victim blaming nobody likes that

1309
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,260
especially not the victim especially not

1310
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:05,150
when there's you know a billion victims

1311
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,560
nobody likes that that's a lot of angry

1312
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,530
people

1313
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,330
so the DNC this one's a little different

1314
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,859
clearly not jumping into the politics

1315
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:17,299
and the specifics of what came out or

1316
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:20,690
when PS go vote but this was a personal

1317
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,160
email how it happened you know phishing

1318
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,359
link you can train people as much as you

1319
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,029
want they're still gonna click on shut

1320
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,529
like they're just going to so all of

1321
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,540
their emails got out there super

1322
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,950
embarrassing all kinds of strategy all

1323
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,529
kinds of things being written down that

1324
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:38,089
should not be written down conversations

1325
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:40,700
in systems and it didn't it just kept

1326
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:43,100
coming it didn't all come out at once

1327
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,540
it just kept dripping that drip effect

1328
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,890
is a huge problem in crisis

1329
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,570
communications because it's what takes

1330
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,339
that one story and turns it into 50 and

1331
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:52,720
makes those 50 like election altering

1332
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,720
like it just keeps happening

1333
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:56,569
it's still embarrassing regardless of

1334
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:58,669
how they handled it regardless of what

1335
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:00,709
they did personally it was embarrassing

1336
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:04,029
for individuals professionally it was

1337
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:07,399
embarrassing for the organization again

1338
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:09,469
it's not always the data that you think

1339
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,759
you should protect that is the most

1340
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:14,919
damaging have to protect it all and the

1341
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:17,269
ugly

1342
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:18,439
obviously Equifax I feel like it would

1343
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:20,359
be malpractice if I didn't mention

1344
00:49:18,439 --> 00:49:22,249
Equifax but you start to feel bad after

1345
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:25,130
a while like you can only dance on

1346
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:27,140
someone's grave so many times but

1347
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,109
they're just so textbook of everything

1348
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:31,788
that went wrong they just didn't they

1349
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:33,288
they literally knew about it months

1350
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:35,359
before they told us it's kind of a

1351
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,499
problem why did you wait that long oh

1352
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,689
because you wanted to sell us all your

1353
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:41,718
stock cool yeah that makes me really

1354
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:44,209
happy about it they are a textbook

1355
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:47,689
example of how to mismanage the

1356
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:51,229
communications of a response so badly

1357
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:53,959
that literally everyone hates you it's

1358
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:56,089
not really good for business clearly

1359
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:57,948
they're still in business they're still

1360
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:59,808
moving but if you think about all the

1361
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:04,849
things that went wrong like they set up

1362
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:07,309
a website and then it crashed and set up

1363
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:08,689
a website it crashed it went wrong they

1364
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:10,459
were telling people here's a free

1365
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:12,919
service that you can use oh by the way

1366
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:16,899
we run that service we're not gonna tell

1367
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:19,009
you that I mean it it just kept going

1368
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,839
none of their customer-facing response

1369
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:22,969
was good in their initial statement that

1370
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,038
they put out the very first thing if you

1371
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:27,829
read that statement closely was uh who

1372
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,509
are so sorry this happened to us what

1373
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:31,219
nobody cares that this happened to you

1374
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:32,989
everyone cares this that happened to us

1375
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:35,329
never start by telling us how bad you

1376
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:38,449
feel for yourself we don't care we are

1377
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:40,939
the victims you should be a partner in

1378
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:42,469
this victimization with us you should

1379
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:45,618
not do something that makes us look at

1380
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:46,880
you as the bad guy that is a problem

1381
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:48,769
that is another one of those nuances

1382
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,019
when it comes to reputation if you are

1383
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:54,529
handling something in a way that turns

1384
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:57,468
the whole narrative around and makes you

1385
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:59,089
the bad guy in the situation you've

1386
00:50:57,469 --> 00:51:02,119
clearly done something wrong and that is

1387
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:04,849
a very tough ship to turn around so I

1388
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:06,950
put target on here target has done I

1389
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:10,220
believe an amazing job sin

1390
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:13,578
this happened in 2013 of building out a

1391
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,899
secure making themselves secure if you

1392
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,400
will making all of a secure they've done

1393
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,310
tons of stuff they've led lots of

1394
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,510
changes all of that's great but if you

1395
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:23,000
look at everything they did in that

1396
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,070
moment it's everything that's wrong they

1397
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,710
also were the victim of being the first

1398
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:30,349
mouse which sucks clearly if you're the

1399
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,089
first Mouse Home Depot benefited from it

1400
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:35,599
again like we said they weren't the

1401
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:38,480
shock value that target was but I leave

1402
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,930
target on the ugly cents ugly slide if

1403
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:45,349
you will because we are still talking

1404
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:48,970
about them they are still the thing we

1405
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:51,290
point to to say textbook bad response

1406
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,759
maybe not now maybe now they would

1407
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,279
handle it beautifully but then they

1408
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,990
didn't and they're still there which

1409
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,760
again if we're still talking about how

1410
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,290
bad you are at crisis response and it's

1411
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,359
been five years and everyone else has

1412
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:05,920
been worse since then that sucks for you

1413
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:08,990
so you could be on the ugly slide so

1414
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,750
three things you can do today because

1415
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,189
again now you all understand why this is

1416
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,720
important you all understand why

1417
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,640
reputation matters even if it's not your

1418
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,839
responsibility you understand why

1419
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,890
resilience is the thing that matters

1420
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,328
regardless of whether these are your

1421
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:24,980
responsibilities and more likely than

1422
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,910
not they aren't which is fine even if

1423
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,430
you're in charge of Incident Response

1424
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:31,490
planning you're part of that team you're

1425
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:33,799
part of the incident response team all

1426
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:35,598
of this isn't gonna be in your AOR and

1427
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,160
that's fine but you should start asking

1428
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,200
the right questions these you need to

1429
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,500
make sure that somebody and your

1430
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,140
organization is taking responsibility

1431
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,490
for this knows they have responsibility

1432
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,828
for this and is doing it the right way

1433
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,500
and you have a sense of what the right

1434
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:53,510
way is and so you need to start that

1435
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,480
conversation to help make sure they are

1436
00:52:53,510 --> 00:53:00,109
part of your plan that you have plans

1437
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,690
that work together they may not they may

1438
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:04,250
have a great crisis set of plans for all

1439
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,960
kinds of scenarios but it may not be an

1440
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,490
effective cyber event that they've

1441
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,869
planned for you need to help them

1442
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:11,839
understand that so that you can work

1443
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:13,040
together in that response and it all

1444
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,470
starts with asking the right questions

1445
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,569
sometimes the first question is so whose

1446
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,189
may point of contact over here what do

1447
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,570
we talk to over in the communication

1448
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:23,780
shop and that's great

1449
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:25,550
review your plan whatever kind of ir

1450
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,550
plan you have or planning that you've

1451
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:30,880
done check it if you haven't done one

1452
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:34,070
good lord go do it once you've done it

1453
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,440
check it from this lens check it from

1454
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,660
the communications perspective there are

1455
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:41,390
quick easy assessments that can be done

1456
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:42,950
to just identify where you may have a

1457
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,140
blind spot where you may not have

1458
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,620
identified a vulnerability and accounted

1459
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,049
for it

1460
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,390
these are easy things to do and they can

1461
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,920
save you a lot of time and a lot of you

1462
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,350
know weeping and gnashing of teeth in

1463
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,510
the long run and then shifting your

1464
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:57,860
mindset from secure to resilient not

1465
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,960
just for your networks but for your

1466
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,670
entire organization you're not gonna be

1467
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,230
able to protect everyone all the time so

1468
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,700
you want to make sure that everyone

1469
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:07,430
sleeps well at night knowing that

1470
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,910
whatever happens you got it you can

1471
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,350
handle it

1472
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:12,589
because your organization's ready that's

1473
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:15,710
what makes you resilient so I believe we

1474
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:20,240
have like 45 seconds for questions if

1475
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:21,470
anybody has any whoa ha okay we'll start

1476
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,850
right there cuz you've been a good

1477
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,540
participate or not in your head lots and

1478
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:25,540
lots I'll calling you first

1479
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,180
yep

1480
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:49,990
well one way and I'm not sure it would

1481
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:52,539
have necessarily worked in the dnc case

1482
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,700
because there were such sensitive

1483
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:57,670
political considerations all around it

1484
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,379
but in traditional crisis communications

1485
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,779
you avoid the drip drip by pushing it

1486
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:05,829
all out there yourselves you know what

1487
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:08,170
they have so you can control its release

1488
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:10,930
just as much as they can maybe you

1489
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,249
didn't want to put it out there but sure

1490
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:14,589
it's not gonna have less of an impact if

1491
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:16,689
you put it all out there at once it's

1492
00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:20,470
like the bad news dump on Friday is it

1493
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:22,210
you know 4:45 if you dump all at one

1494
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:23,439
time nobody's gonna be able to dig

1495
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,999
through every single little piece of it

1496
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,430
and every little piece won't get its own

1497
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:29,348
news cycle the adversary is making sure

1498
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,328
that every little piece gets its own

1499
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:31,630
cycle if you shove it all out there at

1500
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,970
once

1501
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:35,049
you got one or two news cycles maybe to

1502
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,999
dig it through but no one's gonna take

1503
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:40,180
the time to make each individual piece a

1504
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:44,529
pain point so dump and dump in the

1505
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:51,299
ground basically there were others yes

1506
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:51,299
way back there you're the ax T Bo guy

1507
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,460
right

1508
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,860
no I think he goes back to being

1509
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,870
transparent being completely as

1510
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:33,780
transparent as you're possibly capable

1511
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:36,240
of being it's not a drip because that's

1512
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:39,570
the expectations management piece a drip

1513
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,959
is what Yahoo did where they changed

1514
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,400
their story as they had new information

1515
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,390
that's the expectations piece where in

1516
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,700
the beginning you say what we know now

1517
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:52,620
we're still looking we're still

1518
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,750
investigating the forensics team is

1519
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,350
still on site the FBI is still here

1520
00:56:54,750 --> 00:57:00,600
we've got the best and brightest on it

1521
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:04,170
but we will have more information as we

1522
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,339
discover more you know that's not a very

1523
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,570
artful way of saying it but that's

1524
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:09,480
essentially what it is that's how you

1525
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:11,580
manage the expectations for we will have

1526
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,880
more information for you when we know it

1527
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:16,350
ourselves the investigation is ongoing

1528
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,420
you don't say here's what happened XYZ

1529
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:22,140
done done thanks bye call me for

1530
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:24,390
questions yeah oh it's exactly because

1531
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,069
you only know snapshots another great

1532
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,450
way to describe it you only know what

1533
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,890
you can see right there you only know

1534
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,290
your slice of the world with the

1535
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:35,790
visibility that you have and over time

1536
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:37,830
your visibility will grow so you set up

1537
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:39,570
the expectation that when I know more

1538
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:41,700
you'll know more and there's gonna be

1539
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:43,350
more so everyone sit tight and if it

1540
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,000
turns out there is no more guess what

1541
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,799
there was no more now you're already

1542
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,410
used to what I told you so it's not that

1543
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,570
big of a deal if there is more you knew

1544
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,730
it was coming so now you trust me as a

1545
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:57,600
source of credible information and not

1546
00:57:53,730 --> 00:58:00,390
as a less than credible person who's

1547
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,960
changing their story over time does that

1548
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,900
make sense

1549
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,220
it's that and that it's that managing

1550
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,230
those expectations right there in the

1551
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,169
very beginning that is not part of a

1552
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,790
traditional crisis plan you don't manage

1553
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,250
expectations for the next six months you

1554
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,300
manage expectations for I'll have the

1555
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:20,880
rest of it for you tomorrow

1556
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:22,910
stay tuned so DIF anyone else two

1557
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,960
minutes oh that was more than 45 seconds

1558
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,200
bring on all your super long questions

1559
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,200
yes

1560
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:47,809
mmm-hmm right it's not like 12 Christmas

1561
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:49,700
presents at Target Yeah right it is kind

1562
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:52,940
of almost becoming a fact of life and I

1563
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,828
think that there's not a lot of

1564
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,950
long-term research that I'm familiar

1565
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:59,779
with that says you know if you do it

1566
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,578
wrong here six years from now you're

1567
00:58:59,779 --> 00:59:05,470
probably out of business like that

1568
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:07,640
doesn't really exist but you look at

1569
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,299
part of it is because some of the

1570
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:13,490
longer-term costs play out in the legal

1571
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:15,440
system they play out in lawsuits they

1572
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,848
play out in judgments you know whether

1573
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,980
it's class-action or otherwise you know

1574
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:21,680
I think I just saw a headline about you

1575
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,480
know Yahoo paying somebody however many

1576
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,410
millions of dollars and it's like we're

1577
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:29,359
still talking about that so I'm not

1578
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:32,270
aware of specific numbers around how

1579
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,950
that impacts but if you look at there's

1580
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,660
usually articles that are written about

1581
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,669
dropping stock prices and the stock

1582
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,930
prices go back up and up and down you

1583
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,460
never went articles written about your

1584
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,410
company and how your stock prices are

1585
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:46,339
like fluctuating wildly because you've

1586
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:48,710
screwed something up so you know as as

1587
00:59:46,339 --> 00:59:50,839
that specific sort of reputation

1588
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:54,970
management side goes those are never

1589
00:59:50,839 --> 00:59:58,520
good but the specific actual business

1590
00:59:54,970 --> 01:00:00,828
financial impact just varies wildly if

1591
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,200
you're a small mid-sized business this

1592
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:07,369
has a much bigger impact there's some

1593
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,348
stat that you know 86% will actually

1594
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:11,089
face a significant loss of business you

1595
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:13,099
know 50% will be out of business if

1596
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:14,690
something happens to them because it's

1597
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,579
so much more trust base and their

1598
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,279
financial like fluctuation is so much

1599
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:22,930
tighter so even more important if you're

1600
01:00:19,279 --> 01:00:22,930
small yes

1601
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:41,310
um that has nothing to do with the cyber

1602
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,950
side of communications that has to do

1603
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,980
with just general message control within

1604
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:48,750
your organization you know you have your

1605
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,400
employee handbook who gets to talk who

1606
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:52,440
doesn't get to talk what happens if you

1607
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,240
do talk out of turn somebody very may

1608
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,520
well have put that doctor up there to

1609
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,839
talk or they're in violation of a

1610
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,910
company policy and that's always

1611
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,280
something that you run the risk of which

1612
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:03,359
is part of why you monitor everything

1613
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,570
that's coming at you because you never

1614
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,670
know who's gonna like leak out the sides

1615
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:10,680
but that kind of a thing is just a fact

1616
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:13,350
of life when it comes to communications

1617
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:18,390
across an organization it sucks

1618
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:20,009
you know I had a I was at a government

1619
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:22,170
organization where I was working one of

1620
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:24,030
my colleagues had what he considered to

1621
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,740
be a very good relationship with all the

1622
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:27,120
media even though he had nothing to do

1623
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,830
with communications like he would send

1624
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,359
them daily emails every morning or he

1625
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,440
would see their stories at like 5:00 in

1626
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,150
the morning before the rest of us did

1627
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,560
and by the time I even got to work he

1628
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,020
had already fired off angry emails

1629
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,000
correcting like 10 of them so we just

1630
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,110
came to a happy compromise where every

1631
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,840
time he sent one of those anger emails
