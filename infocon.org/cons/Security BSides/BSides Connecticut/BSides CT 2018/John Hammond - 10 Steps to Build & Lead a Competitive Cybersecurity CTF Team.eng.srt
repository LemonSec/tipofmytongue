you all right hi good morning thank you

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,550
thank you for coming to hang out and see

an opportunity to to speak so thank you

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,640
very much this is the 10 steps to build

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,789
and lead a cyber security or capture the

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,829
flag team the steps are gonna be kind of

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,110
high-level in nature but I'll try and be

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,689
as detailed as I can to explain how you

28
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,090
can actually and actively accomplish

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,679
them I will be around at the end if you

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,490
have any questions of course and we'll

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,119
get to it so obligatory introductory

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,229
slide hi hello I'm John Hammond I am a

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,700
Coast Guard hacker I've been doing that

34
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,259
for a couple years with them and that's

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,040
how I got all this cool PowerPoint

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,720
presentation skills I have availability

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,159
on the Internet right you can find me on

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,750
the interwebs I have a github account

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,189
that should have a lot of the code

40
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,780
content and material that I'll be

41
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,029
showcasing here if anyone is interested

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,530
and I have a cheesy YouTube channel

43
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,540
where I showcase some programming

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,030
tutorials video walkthrough write-ups

45
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,040
for capture the flag challenges etc so

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,220
if you're interested in that like

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,149
comment and subscribe

48
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,619
ok so step number 0 the title of the

49
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,310
talk is a little bit of a falsehood

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,399
right

51
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,340
I went from 0 to 10 inclusive so it's

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,130
really 11 steps but 10 step sounds a lot

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,920
better than the title I digress so this

54
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,079
is step 0 because it is self-evident

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,509
right it's kind of implied if you want

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,549
to build and train a cyber security or

57
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,890
capture the flag team you want them to

58
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,590
have a network or a playground to really

59
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,390
in practice in so you want that both

60
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,190
physically and digitally for one thing

61
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,989
you want a physical space a room and

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,690
infrastructure that encourages that

63
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,430
creativity that innovation and just like

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,620
kind of spawns the enthusiasm for that

65
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,660
kind of work and also digitally right

66
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,070
you want it to have unfiltered internet

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,840
access because you're probably going to

68
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,940
be looking at port ranges and computers

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,400
that you may not want someone else's

70
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,109
thumb on and you want access to a lot of

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
Technology right so you've got Windows

72
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,640
computers of course just as we're used

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,380
to and Linux machines especially Linux

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,049
machines and you still wanted to have

75
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,459
that cool hacker friendly vibe right so

76
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,260
have a lot of toys in there have a lot

77
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,709
of gadgets like security reference books

78
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,660
and stuff like a Raspberry Pi or a Wi-Fi

79
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,610
pineapple or rubber ducky that stuff

80
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,900
that just fosters enthusiasm and

81
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,560
excitement when someone's bored and just

82
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,570
wants to jam so this is a physical space

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
that myself and my team occupied for a

84
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,430
little bit and I actually hate this I

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,810
use this as an example of what not to do

86
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,580
but this is probably just personal

87
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,110
opinion I think that those kind of

88
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,840
tables that are just jutted out are

89
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,549
bolted to the ground and that sucks

90
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,890
I think that's dumb and stupid and

91
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,560
stupid and dumb because I think as a

92
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,540
team you want to be like close and

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,670
comfortable and cozy right when you have

94
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,950
that literal physical separation it

95
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,958
inherently divides the team and I didn't

96
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,149
like that so eventually we did get that

97
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,880
kind of space and that will lead me to

98
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,760
the real step number one right get your

99
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,040
people on keyboard and like as fast as

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,230
you can this should be the first thing

101
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,480
that you do and it should be everything

102
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,829
that you do so when you're first

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,380
starting out right when you're trying to

104
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,410
build up this team you're gonna trying

105
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,900
to recruit newcomers and they may not

106
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,640
know any of this stuff they may not even

107
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,620
know how to use a computer or just don't

108
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,730
know what these acronyms are and that's

109
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,310
okay right

110
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,720
because you want to be open and inviting

111
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,190
and just receptive to everyone there

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,070
you're not trying to be selective so

113
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,590
what you should do is get them on a

114
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,200
command line as fast as possible and sit

115
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,940
down right beside them like literally be

116
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,279
beside them and show them that you want

117
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,048
to teach them just walk through steps

118
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,419
with them go through command by command

119
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,859
and get them up to speed in the

120
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,479
beginning you're gonna be teaching a lot

121
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,360
of introductory and fun

122
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,610
stuff but that's okay right you can make

123
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,910
it fun and engaging especially if you're

124
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,350
on an operative so a utility that I put

125
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,120
together to kind of help teach people

126
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,260
this introductory stuff is called

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,820
training wheels

128
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,680
you can find this on my github account

129
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,490
it's part of the introduction of Linux

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,290
course and it acts like a voice right it

131
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,270
manifests itself and kind of another

132
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,400
colored text while you're working in

133
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,650
Linux command line in bash in the shell

134
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,450
and it will kind of talk to you and walk

135
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,340
you through certain kinds of lessons so

136
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,740
you may be entering a command it may be

137
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,020
teaching you okay about the man pages or

138
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,630
how to navigate through the filesystem

139
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,539
etc and for one thing it's holding your

140
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,370
hand right but I may not have to be

141
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,870
beside you looking over your shoulder or

142
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,030
breathing down your neck but you're

143
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,640
still engaged you're still on a keyboard

144
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,690
and it's not a lecturer kind of droning

145
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,310
on in front of the PowerPoint

146
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,500
presentation making you guys fall asleep

147
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,690
like right now okay

148
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,000
personally I think that that active

149
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,190
engagement and that reinforced learning

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,060
is the best way to teach people things

151
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,420
you should try your hardest to gamify

152
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:39,990
everything anyone play capture the flag

153
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:42,870
cool yeah so make everything a capture

154
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,760
the flag make like trying to exit out of

155
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,410
vim a capture the flag everything that

156
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,830
you can do give your people an

157
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,590
opportunity to learn something practice

158
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,270
what they learn and then actively feel

159
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,700
like they're in control of their

160
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:02,219
learning okay number two grow a central

161
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,409
repository or kind of a hub of your

162
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,240
training material and this can be any

163
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,180
forum you want right this can be a

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,820
github repository this can be a list on

165
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,460
a whiteboard if you want but the more

166
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,440
dynamic the more active and engaging

167
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,020
that it is the better that it is right

168
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,880
so take for example like like a web

169
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,680
portal a framework that your team

170
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,300
members and yourself can log in to have

171
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,910
an account and they can interact with

172
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,860
everything that your team does and

173
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,560
that's exactly what I mean you want it

174
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,780
to be everything open and accessible so

175
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,570
that every team member can contribute

176
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,250
like new or old veteran or newcomer they

177
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,950
can still add their own content and

178
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,410
create their own material

179
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,060
so you as a leader right should want to

180
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,920
develop challenges and make that

181
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,800
training material make them available to

182
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,320
your people and then make them want to

183
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,060
do the exact same thing once someone

184
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,890
breaks the glass ceiling and creates

185
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,510
their own challenges suddenly that

186
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,120
excitement like spreads like wildfire

187
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,650
because for one thing they're gonna want

188
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,040
to show their friends their challenges

189
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,020
and like broadcast it right and suddenly

190
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,360
other people are going to want to make

191
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,580
challenges too and I think that that is

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,020
like the secret to fostering group

193
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,849
growth and development because now

194
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,159
you've got this awesome feedback loop

195
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,380
for one thing you train your people and

196
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,850
then suddenly your people train your

197
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,980
people and that's awesome that's that's

198
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,970
a win that's wins all around alright

199
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,250
step number three let your team members

200
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,200
share their knowledge now that

201
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,090
everyone's kind of educated and like

202
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,390
learned up right give them the spotlight

203
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,299
and let them teach offer opportunities

204
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,530
to present tool cases like present

205
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,980
different tools techniques

206
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,700
vulnerabilities etc so every Sunday I

207
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,170
would ping like our slack channel and

208
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,300
that's a tangent step number three and a

209
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,860
half have a slack channel or like a

210
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,800
discord server or matter most thing to

211
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:59,190
keep that communication with your team

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,440
back to step three ask them if they're

213
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,420
willing to do a presentation or showcase

214
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,460
some kind of demonstration and

215
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,320
originally this was meant for like an

216
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,270
opportunity for veteran members to

217
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,650
showcase what they've learned and prove

218
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,780
their skillset and train the other

219
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,580
members but this stuff could be anything

220
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,619
right like it could be a theoretical

221
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,320
presentation it could be like a very

222
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,540
general topic oriented or it could get

223
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,000
in the weeds with like RSA cryptography

224
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,190
or binary exploitation or even like

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,450
trying to code a blind sequel injection

226
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,850
and Python

227
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,200
cool cool stuff or it could be fun it

228
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,900
could be like a morale booster thing

229
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:38,819
like the steam local command and Linux

230
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,860
ASL so this brought a lot more life to

231
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,349
our practices right and it helps spread

232
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,270
the wealth as one person grew and

233
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,130
developed they could share what they've

234
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,199
learned and then help other people grow

235
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,480
and develop just the same way and just

236
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,070
like creating challenges and content and

237
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,050
material this kind of thing is

238
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,580
contagious like it

239
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,019
soon as someone sees their friend to

240
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,640
give a presentation they're gonna be

241
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,080
like I want to do that too and they'll

242
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,560
create their own presentations and

243
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,810
present in the future step number four

244
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,029
keep constant communication and this is

245
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,319
kind of in addition to the slack channel

246
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:13,320
or discord server or whatever you do

247
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,019
always be in touch with the people and I

248
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,010
don't mean like annoying emails at you

249
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,940
forward and you haven't even read

250
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,430
through an article or something

251
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,399
I mean worthwhile content you want to

252
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,410
digest and curate what you show off to

253
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,120
your people so I would start out

254
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,640
practices with what we kind of fondly

255
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,529
referred to as the spiel and that

256
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,110
Wooding often include like time stamps

257
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,579
and information from CTF time so an

258
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,350
online resource to kind of monitor

259
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,839
upcoming competitions and stuff like

260
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,760
that I would include things from the

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,100
zero daily newsletter that hacker won

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,470
showcases in case there's any real-world

263
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,720
security events going on and I monitor

264
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,029
stuff from a subreddit like our security

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,860
CTF or net sec because you can always

266
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,439
find new events and just stuff going on

267
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,050
in the world so at the end of that at

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,790
the end of passing that information open

269
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,199
the floor and let your people do the

270
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,880
exact same thing in case they have

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,790
anything that they want to share they

272
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,790
want to bring the table that's awesome

273
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:11,520
okay number five provide incentive for

274
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,399
your people to engage and then encourage

275
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,199
them to you should give praise and like

276
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,410
publicly recognize those people that

277
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,899
work hard so for one thing your central

278
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,209
repository that hub could have like a

279
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,310
leaderboard right and maybe the people

280
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,869
that create and solve those home main

281
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,719
challenges will climb the ranks on that

282
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,240
leaderboard or perhaps if you wanted to

283
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,450
make it so that people that present more

284
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,640
often that solve create produce more

285
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,110
challenges or create write-ups solutions

286
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,640
the challenges maybe they could get

287
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,680
points for that kind of thing and just

288
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,870
give them a means to see their see their

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,979
progression in their growth and when you

290
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,839
provide an update

291
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,300
like the spiel or some other kind of

292
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,699
announcement forms like don't hesitate

293
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,930
to call people by name and just publicly

294
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:56,760
recognize them if they're doing good

295
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,229
work like if someone on your team is

296
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,149
consistently willing to give a

297
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,329
presentation or showcase something

298
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:05,010
recognize them if someone like solves a

299
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,109
crazy hard challenge in a recent

300
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,760
competition that requires some uber leap

301
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,060
cyber ninja skill

302
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,470
nice them if a few people work on 1ct up

303
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,260
with you and just a few members of your

304
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,940
team but not all of them that's okay but

305
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,430
you can publicly recognize the people

306
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,930
that do and then the Pima the teammates

307
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,079
that don't will be more like to

308
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,140
participate in the next competition

309
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,140
number six constantly look out for new

310
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,290
events your first prerogative and your

311
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,150
priority should be training value so do

312
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,280
everything in your power to share

313
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,220
experiences with other people that

314
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,680
normally means trying to send as many

315
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,480
people as possible to as many things as

316
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,280
possible you're gonna want to be

317
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,080
thirsting for new events to go to so

318
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,030
lurk around on the internet and check

319
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,710
the balls for upcoming like competitions

320
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,510
and catch the flag events you want to

321
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,490
stay on top of b-sides conferences like

322
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,410
this knowing that tickets go on sale

323
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,690
know if they have a capture the flag

324
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,000
besides Delaware's next weekend anyone

325
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,510
going to that all right it's a road trip

326
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,760
yeah I gotcha plan the availability to

327
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,340
go to as many events as you can try to

328
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,200
go to Sands training attend net Wars go

329
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,630
to cyber seed in Connecticut or

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,490
competitions like MIT CTF Kaizen hack

331
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,439
the Machine the list goes on and on

332
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,950
anything that you can get your hands on

333
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,400
push for it and fight for it

334
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,840
step number seven place ETF's right this

335
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,380
is the big one this is the most

336
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,440
important step actively do it actively

337
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,470
practice place ETFs and place so many

338
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,690
CTFs that you gain some sort of weird

339
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,330
Association and like tribal knowledge

340
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,550
for upcoming competitions like let's say

341
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,870
you saw an event coming up and you know

342
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,550
you've played that last year or a

343
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,410
previous year and now you kind of have

344
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,540
the know-how to tell your people and

345
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,150
tell your teammates oh yeah that one is

346
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,860
super duper hard or oh man that one's

347
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,240
super easy I think all of us should play

348
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,710
because we're gonna get so much training

349
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,420
value out of it that's awesome

350
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,760
when a CTF is not online play war games

351
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,069
try over the wire smash the stack like

352
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,350
crypto pals micro corruption potable kar

353
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,350
sans hold a hack the list goes on and on

354
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,120
if a war game is just a little bit out

355
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,180
of reach for some of your newcomers

356
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,670
that's okay because again you can create

357
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,199
your own custom content you can be in

358
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,719
control of that

359
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,460
trajectory what's difficult what's easy

360
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,860
how do I hand hold someone to learn

361
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,530
something new the best benefit of

362
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,750
creating your own content is that the

363
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,579
author or the developer of the challenge

364
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,530
or whatever training material is in the

365
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,000
same room with you and you can always

366
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,220
pass them you can always ping them and

367
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
they can offer however many hints or as

368
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,730
much guidance as they would like and

369
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,410
that's an awesome thing a cool thing to

370
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,640
do with that as well is hold your own

371
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,100
like in-house capture-the-flag

372
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,800
competitions like once you've built up a

373
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,540
ton of material otoño training value see

374
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,890
if you can roast your own in-house and

375
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:02,040
local competition sup number eight read

376
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,980
write-ups and write write-ups analyze

377
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,349
your own efforts during a competition

378
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,910
when you and your team play a CTF keep

379
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,610
track of what you solved and what you

380
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,870
didn't solve keep track of the category

381
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,000
for the things that you didn't solve

382
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,580
right write-ups for the challenges that

383
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,190
you did solve and read write-ups for the

384
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,390
challenges that you didn't solve so one

385
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,240
of the best things lately is that

386
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,160
write-ups aren't just a complete wall of

387
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,070
text that make make your eyes glaze over

388
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,620
we have like YouTube video write-ups

389
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,720
between live overflow gin ville cold

390
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,950
wind myself hip SEC there are plenty of

391
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
people that are trying to make this

392
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:42,090
content in other forms and in other

393
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,340
media's so totally jump into that once

394
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,050
you solve a challenge or someone else on

395
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,810
your team does and a couple other people

396
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,079
don't get it that's alright make a

397
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,400
presentation share the knowledge

398
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,290
recreate the challenge and maybe like a

399
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,900
distilled form and your own custom

400
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,160
material that's again accessible from

401
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,439
your central hub so these things all

402
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,020
kind of come together that is how you

403
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,820
improve tell your team in the daily

404
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,270
update in the spiel or whatever the case

405
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,310
may be

406
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,350
when write-ups are out and available for

407
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,449
a recent competition and then encourage

408
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,830
them to go read through it just it

409
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,870
doesn't matter if it's like bathroom

410
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,800
reading as long as it happens that's the

411
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,130
way to improve step number nine

412
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,380
repeat do this over and over again I

413
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,880
think you probably noticed that a lot of

414
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,090
these things aren't like a one and done

415
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,280
this isn't a one-time only step this is

416
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,710
an iterative thing and that makes for

417
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,370
like the heartbeat and the pulse of a

418
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:40,230
growing team

419
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,060
still number ten and this is the final

420
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,160
step

421
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,619
stretch your people this is like the

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,280
icing on the cake because a lot of these

423
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,110
steps when you implement them you

424
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,060
inherently mark yourself as the leader

425
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,470
like you become the dedicated example

426
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,910
for what the team should be and

427
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,710
everything that you you want the group

428
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,380
to grow into but if you want to hit the

429
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,960
next level to keep the team growing

430
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,360
after you you have to stretch them like

431
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:09,300
drag them out of their comfort zone so

432
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,740
walk around during practice and just see

433
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,630
if people are actively doing something

434
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,790
are they participating are they learning

435
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,380
new things to make sure that everyone

436
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,780
has something to do and something to

437
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,939
work on when a competition comes up that

438
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,189
you know has quality content and a lot

439
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,420
of training value like hold your people

440
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,660
to it and make sure that they actually

441
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,969
play push them to say like five

442
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,650
challenges or ten challenges or 15

443
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:33,630
challenges like make sure they break

444
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,370
that glass ceiling and then show them

445
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,090
the people in the room that are

446
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,430
succeeding

447
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,320
that are solving challenges so they have

448
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,640
someone to reach out to and in grasp at

449
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,540
when they need help or a little bit more

450
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,670
guidance one thing that we did during ez

451
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,550
CTF because we wanted to improve each

452
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,500
member individually we had every person

453
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,589
solve every challenge everything that

454
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,300
they could it was a team competition but

455
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,950
you still want each individual person to

456
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,439
learn so they would do as much as they

457
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,480
could if each player was playing alone

458
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,520
there was a team in the room there's

459
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,170
people around and you can keep track of

460
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,000
who's struggling who should we keep

461
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,520
bringing up to speed and that's an

462
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,980
awesome thing what we did was we created

463
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,569
like a Google Doc spreadsheet where each

464
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,010
team would each team member each

465
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,688
individual person would mark the

466
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,000
challenges that they solve and that

467
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:23,130
would be a visual display right who has

468
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,589
done the most work who can help on a

469
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,959
specific challenge and who needs a

470
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,909
little bit more work this way you have a

471
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,320
sense of accountability and I hate that

472
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,690
word I'm never gonna use it again

473
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,179
I think feedback is a much better word

474
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,190
you've got that internal feedback this

475
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,230
'i have a person's to look at themselves

476
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,490
and say how do i measure up with people

477
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:47,800
in my team and hazard how do i measure

478
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:50,890
up with myself okay so I lied to you

479
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,050
there isn't really a 10 steps way to

480
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,340
build a cyber team that was just a

481
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,580
sneaky trick to get you to come to my

482
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,290
talk there's no book on how to improve

483
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,520
people and even if there were no one

484
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,530
would buy it because they're smarter

485
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,129
than that at least the ones of you that

486
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,149
are still awake

487
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:09,160
there's no way to condense or

488
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,980
encapsulate what should be done to keep

489
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,460
people engaged especially learning and

490
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,500
growing within cybersecurity but I think

491
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,220
that we can at least figure out or get

492
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,130
an idea that for each person it requires

493
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:27,310
like constant practice it requires a

494
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:29,440
platform and a framework to progress and

495
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:32,950
measure their progress progression and

496
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,230
it mean it also needs a means to feel

497
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,460
good about their success like when they

498
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,220
are actively learning and doing

499
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,160
something new so the most important

500
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,870
thing is to make sure your people are

school at some point in my life so I can

510
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:33,080
probably offer some insight there I

511
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:35,990
think an awesome thing is to create

512
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,340
posters make flyers if you need a

513
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,139
spokesperson or if you need some

514
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,090
individual that loves being on the

515
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:42,229
keyboard likes to do cybersecurity your

516
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,668
computer program and that kind of stuff

517
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,309
if you're just trying to seek out that

518
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:49,249
individual put up posters in the high

519
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:52,158
school track him down and maybe if it's

520
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:54,230
a casual email or just engage in in

521
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,539

those that are deep in that scene yeah

528

I think that's an awesome thing getting

529
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,879
that getting the library or like a

530
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:40,730
public space rented out to just do

531
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,620
something live is awesome ok the

532
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,750
suggestion was if you're trying to kind

533
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,280
of start this ground up like grassroots

534
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,440
get people engaged in a capture a flag

535
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,200
or cybersecurity scene do something

536
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,390
local like at a public library or some

537
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,730
venue that is local to that town and

538
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,660
keep people growing and trying to get

539
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,370
engaged that way because you'll have

540
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:08,660
that spot and those resources and

541
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:09,860
infrastructure I think lunch is next so

542
