1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,020
so let's get started on our next talk

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:09,210
I'm going to introduce Lauren mother

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,230
mother and the name of the talk is how

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,300
should you prepare for the

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,950
implementation of Connecticut's new

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:20,160
cyber strategy so give her a warm

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:22,198
welcome all right thank you great I

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,900
heard that so I know someone's awake

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,029
which is awesome 2:30 in the afternoon

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,409
is always my favorite time slot to draw

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,900
because it's a little bit of a coin flip

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,030
on how many heads are still here and how

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,070
many heads are actually looking up so

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,480
I'm gonna be watching so you know I have

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,780
nothing to throw but I will find

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,398
something if I need to but two quick

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,110
things before we jump all into this

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,920
first off I am NOT a technical person

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,269
you're welcome you're gonna get

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,160
something a little bit different here

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,680
for the next hour because there is

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,989
nothing I'm about to tell you that is

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,750
going to make you snazzier at what you

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,269
do it's gonna make you more aware of

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,410
what is going on through other parts of

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,989
your company and what kinds of

27
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,200
priorities and things people like me are

28
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,000
out there telling your bosses to do and

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,010
the kinds of advice that they're getting

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,189
that will eventually at some point

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,759
likely impact all of your lives so this

32
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,889
really is sort of a let's think of it as

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,270
a broader educational opportunity into

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,020
what's going on from the business side

35
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,048
of the world quick background on me I am

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,789
an independent consultant I own my own

37
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,530
strategic communications company

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,290
focusing on cyber security and defense

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,329
issues my background is primarily in

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,240
national security communications policy

41
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,820
politics spent over a decade in

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,649
Washington DC Capitol Hill Department of

43
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,329
Defense national security council always

44
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,880
doing communications policy politics

45
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,408
rolled up into a big swirly mess of I

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,199
don't know make it up yourself and

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,939
figure out what to do for us so that's

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,530
what I like and that's what this job

49
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,570
lets me do now that I get to be my own

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,399
boss so it's been a few years doing

51
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,100
corporate communications in New York

52
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,350
before launching out on my own so have

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,259
always enjoyed being in roles and

54
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,329
finding places to understand different

55
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,099
parts of an organization different parts

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,920
of a company different parts of a

57
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,200
government agency and what all of their

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,399
priorities and needs and assets are and

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,859
how we bring all those things together

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
to move forward towards whatever those

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,920
organizational objectives are whether

62
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,000
they're policy objectives whether

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,849
they're business whatever they may be so

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,190
firmly now in the cyber security space

65
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,988
spend a lot of time with clients

66
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,359
particularly around IR planning because

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,760
obviously that's one of the key places

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,230
where crisis communications and things

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,280
like that can play a role we'll talk

70
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,849
about that a little bit later on but

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,470
Connecticut's got this great new

72
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,720
strategy that outs out there and

73
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,010
strategies are awesome because they tell

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,090
you what the strategy is and then they

75
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,530
stop talking so now the next step is to

76
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,290
figure out how we actually take those

77
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,390
great cool ideas and actually turn them

78
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,519
into something that requires action and

79
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,589
there are so many ways that that could

80
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,299
go right now we're still in the figuring

81
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,530
it out I keep saying we and I really

82
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,870
just mean whoever the smart people in

83
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,519
Connecticut are that are doing this

84
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,620
because I'm not one of them figuring out

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,500
what they're gonna do and there are a

86
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,910
lot of examples that we can look to in

87
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,430
other states and other industries and

88
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,540
other sectors that have tried to do

89
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,200
strategies followed up by action plans

90
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,120
to see most recently the Department of

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,700
Financial Services in New York I'm sure

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,160
that is lightly and to say the least

93
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,298
touching on many of your lives but that

94
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,590
is something that I've been digging into

95
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,820
and speaking about a bit as well and

96
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,859
there are a lot of similarities between

97
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,510
what they did and good lessons to be

98
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,840
learned that can play out in the

99
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,578
situation and I think we can what I'd

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,549
like to do today is dig a little bit

101
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:49,769
into some of the highlighted sections

102
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,510
that I see of the strategy that give us

103
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,790
some insight into what the authors were

104
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,370
thinking and combine those with some

105
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,120
very broad high-level trends across the

106
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,079
quote cyber industry right now and look

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,540
at some of the things that we've seen

108
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,180
work with DFS as well and kind of

109
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,410
combine all those into okay great what

110
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,829
does that tell us about what may be

111
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,859
coming down the road for us and how can

112
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,829
we take what we think may be coming and

113
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:19,289
use that Intel to actually take concrete

114
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,389
steps right now as an organization or as

115
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,800
a business so that when somebody

116
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,770
actually requires us to do something

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,180
it's not this huge giant burden it's

118
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,750
something that we've already started

119
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,400
moving

120
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,810
or we've already done and now we all

121
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,870
have to all we have to do is maybe check

122
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,490
a box on a new form and we're done so

123
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,630
that's what we're gonna start out with

124
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,330
today we're gonna look at a lot of

125
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,920
different buckets of things and if I'm

126
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,840
lucky this keeps working every time I

127
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,650
push the button so like I said not a

128
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,500
tech person so this is directly from the

129
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,969
strategy itself and there's not a lot in

130
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,640
here that says here's what we're gonna

131
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:59,100
do next for an action plan but the word

132
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:01,020
action comes up like 36 times so one of

133
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,460
the things the strategy outlines are

134
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,140
seven foundational principles and we're

135
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,780
going to talk about those and insights

136
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,849
we can draw from them and what they mean

137
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,289
great here all of those principles they

138
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,580
line up they make this great little

139
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,170
pathway and we're all going to hold

140
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,090
hands and march down it towards this

141
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,560
great new place and anybody can do this

142
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,989
and it's gonna make us all awesome

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,419
and then seriously this is probably

144
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:28,380
what's gonna happen this is why I have a

145
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:31,590
job because more companies than you like

146
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,540
to think are this guy and normally this

147
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,950
guy is pretty cool not so much these

148
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,620
days unless he's hiring me and then he's

149
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,210
still cool so we're gonna talk through

150
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,580
the strategy we're gonna get some trends

151
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,919
we're gonna talk action plan you can

152
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,010
tell I came out of a very list oriented

153
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,450
life so we're gonna do a lot of bullets

154
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,700
I'm not writing it down if I'm gonna say

155
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,510
it because you can read what I can say

156
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:59,219
so bottom line big take away money slide

157
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:00,990
right here I apply this to whatever's

158
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,229
coming down the road from Connecticut as

159
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,260
well as what we've seen with the DFS

160
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:10,169
regs in New York you can view this as

161
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,610
just another compliance issue as just

162
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,770
something else you have to do another

163
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,500
box you have to check something else to

164
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,260
spend money and time just clearing the

165
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,770
hurdle or you can view it as a chance to

166
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,080
actually establish a comprehensive wrist

167
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,120
risk-based cybersecurity program that

168
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,250
effectively brings your company up to

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,500
the level that it should be today and if

170
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,200
you do that that in itself creates

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,240
opportunities for your company for your

172
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,530
organization that is where you can

173
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,580
actually use that to propel yourselves

174
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,710
even further so

175
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,270
his business opportunity within this if

176
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,549
you choose to view it and approach it

177
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,030
through that lense bottom line right

178
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,409
there

179
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,710
take it run away if you have to leave

180
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,740
this is where you can go so the strategy

181
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,620
what it actually says it covers five

182
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,020
sectors and each sector gets lots of

183
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,969
detailed attention lots of love lots of

184
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,359
stuff going on what they have done

185
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:09,020
things like that it looks at the five

186
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,189
sectors that it shows that it has chosen

187
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,049
it states that it's done so because

188
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,870
within the state of Connecticut these

189
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,250
are the main targets you know if you

190
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,509
took everything in Connecticut and broke

191
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,830
it down into five groups you could

192
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,479
probably put all of them in these five

193
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,859
groups so it's more of a classification

194
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:29,520
system than it is a winnowing down but

195
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,710
if something were to occur and the

196
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
strategy document itself approaches a

197
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,750
lot of these sectors and a lot of the

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,580
principles it addresses from the

199
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,849
perspective of if something really big

200
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,590
happens in our state as opposed to if a

201
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,050
company gets breached here it's more

202
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,388
what happens if the grid goes down what

203
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,430
happens if like something happens and

204
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,699
chip blows up it's kind of big things

205
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,610
like that so there's a lot of a

206
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,529
recurring theme related to disaster

207
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,819
response because that is something that

208
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,349
the state has planned for that it is

209
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,240
something that the country as a whole

210
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,599
has done so much better planning for

211
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,610
over the last 15 years or so so there

212
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,378
are a lot of parallels that it draws to

213
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,909
those frameworks that are developed but

214
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,680
these are considered to be the biggest

215
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,460
targets and the people most likely to

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,800
have responsibility for responding to

217
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,690
something in some way shape or form

218
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,699
these folks are gonna have to take

219
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,300
action so you have the Connecticut state

220
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,979
government obviously we're big

221
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,270
government we hold all your stuff we

222
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,710
have all your information and of course

223
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,419
people want to come to us because we

224
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,519
have all the cool things the

225
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,510
municipalities I have to say I have

226
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,060
lived in the state of Connecticut for

227
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,458
five years and you guys are a hot little

228
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,049
mess of swirly little municipalities

229
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:45,268
scattered around the state thank you

230
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,250
there are towns there are groups of

231
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,050
things there are government entities

232
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,310
organizations I just want some cities

233
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,319
and counties if we could just clear that

234
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,819
up that'd be super helpful

235
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:54,400
so municipalities get their own

236
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,959
attention here

237
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,000
because it's such a structure here in

238
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,980
the state it's very unique businesses

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,960
specifically focusing on critical

240
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,330
infrastructure financial services

241
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,490
insurance and defense obviously very

242
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,850
large industries here in the state with

243
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,280
very valuable data higher education

244
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,310
another very significant industry in the

245
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,020
state higher education is such a unique

246
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,479
you know as an aside such a unique

247
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,980
sector to really look at because when

248
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,390
you think of financial services you

249
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,190
think oh yeah they want to steal my

250
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,960
credit card information they want to see

251
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:27,430
on my bank account number that's awesome

252
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,590
well they've got that in higher

253
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,939
education too they've got your social

254
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,040
security number they've got your

255
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,600
financial information they've got all

256
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,010
the health records of their students

257
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,470
they've got all the employee data

258
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,180
related to their staff they've got all

259
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,370
the data related to the research

260
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,739
projects they're doing and the subjects

261
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,940
who were in the research projects the

262
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,880
data sets that have been brought into

263
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,590
that the levels and just sheer quantity

264
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,820
of data held within a single higher

265
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,040
Institute of higher education is just

266
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,050
phenomenal and people rarely look at it

267
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,780
to that extent so that's a that's a

268
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,010
whole little bucket in itself law

269
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,040
enforcement and security obviously

270
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,020
always a big part of us so those are the

271
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,540
five big sectors that it breaks down

272
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,490
into but it also explicitly states that

273
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,170
the types of lessons drawn and the types

274
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,950
of focus for each of these industries

275
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,300
can be applied across the board and

276
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,430
ironically it's not one of the sector's

277
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,680
listed here but the strategy makes a

278
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,050
really really big emphasis on regular

279
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,170
citizens normal everyday people if

280
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,750
there's one thing that I think they

281
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,459
would want you to grab and run with from

282
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,470
this strategy it's that this is the

283
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,120
thing for everybody everybody has a role

284
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,680
everyone has a part to play everyone has

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
a responsibility everyone's a target

286
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,300
blah blah blah all those things but that

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,270
if we all come together and we all get

288
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,400
smarter in our own small ways about what

289
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,130
we're doing and how we're securing our

290
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,709
small piece of this whole puzzle then

291
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,020
overall the state becomes more secure

292
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,240
and not only that it actually becomes a

293
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,230
business driver here in the state and if

294
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,660
there's anything Connecticut would

295
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,090
really love to do its drive economic

296
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,480
development drive business drive new

297
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,110
residents drive new jobs for those new

298
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,190
residents

299
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,040
chicken in the egg don't care which

300
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:16,360
comes first just keep coming here by

301
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:20,769
creating connecticut as a entity that is

302
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,140
known for being cyber secure and for

303
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,190
having that ecosystem built up that is

304
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,630
something in the long term

305
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,550
that drives all of this and that will

306
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:31,589
come up a little bit here later on so

307
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:34,569
the seven principles that it talks about

308
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:36,779
each of these come up in various ways

309
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,970
shapes and forms in different sections

310
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,680
both deep dives in and of themselves and

311
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,410
also related to the different industries

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,569
but leadership obviously has to play a

313
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,959
large part in all of this it really

314
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,910
emphasizes you know before we jump into

315
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,040
these another little aside nothing in

316
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,019
here is rocket science nothing at this

317
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,680
level nothing that talks about trends

318
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,690
nothing that talks about industries and

319
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,640
specifics related to them is rocket

320
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,890
science but putting it all together in

321
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,510
one way shape form so everyone's moving

322
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,519
in the same direction I'm basing it on

323
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,959
the same information is something that

324
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,370
actually makes a difference

325
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:18,219
so obviously executives drive culture

326
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:22,149
everyone knows the more the culture of

327
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,880
your organization is driven in a cyber

328
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,579
secure direction that direction comes

329
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,140
from the top nobody down sitting at a

330
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,819
little desk over in the corner

331
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,100
you know punching buttons all day is

332
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,500
gonna make anybody else feel culturally

333
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,870
cyber secure you may be able to have a

334
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,660
really great secure corner but that's it

335
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,209
the bigger change has to be emphasized

336
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,860
from the top it also drives resources

337
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,739
that's where the decisions are made

338
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,149
about priorities for resources that is

339
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,010
another theme that will run throughout

340
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,290
this is that resources drive so much and

341
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,970
we'll talk about that a little bit to

342
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,160
literacy there needs to be a baseline

343
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,130
level of knowledge across both entities

344
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:05,980
as well as individuals employees

345
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:08,140
students k12 college students staff

346
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,170
regular everyday Joe's walking down the

347
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,980
street everyone needs to know something

348
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:17,050
preparation risk-based plans are key and

349
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,120
basing those plans on the existing

350
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,829
disaster frameworks that the state

351
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,850
operates on and I'm not even going to

352
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,430
start listing off

353
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,810
like acronym gobbledy soup that is in

354
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,969
here about all the different types of

355
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,829
frameworks and organizations that exist

356
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,560
to share information and have frameworks

357
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:34,599
that you can base off of but the state

358
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
has really done a big focus on disaster

359
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,800
response and a lot of those lessons

360
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,910
translate easily into the cyberspace so

361
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,649
we can expect to see a lot of

362
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,620
similarities there I think coming down

363
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,959
the line response is another key area

364
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,269
it's not enough to just have a plan you

365
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,149
have to actually execute your plan

366
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,550
well based on what you see on the ground

367
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,990
and information sharing is a huge huge

368
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,209
huge thing across the board and we'll

369
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,910
talk about that again in a minute

370
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:03,550
recovery obviously mitigate the threat

371
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,170
restore your operations get everything

372
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,209
back up and running keep it running

373
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,120
business continuity kind of critical

374
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:12,638
here and evaluation evaluate what

375
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,660
happens how it went and what you can do

376
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,519
better next time that's a piece that you

377
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,009
know applies in any type of disaster

378
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,190
response I'm I used to work for many

379
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:25,750
many years on Capitol Hill right after

380
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,100
9/11 I got there and the office I was

381
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,829
with had a lot of folks in it who were

382
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,779
there on 9/11 and every time we would

383
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,519
have a fire drill from our third floor

384
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:37,120
corner office and our convoluted

385
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,170
building we would go outside someone

386
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,069
would hold the door we'd go down the

387
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,170
stairs so I'm going to hold the door

388
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:44,589
we'd leave and then we would spend two

389
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,930
hours evaluating how effectively we held

390
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,579
the door how effectively we went down

391
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,109
the stairs maybe we should go down

392
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,138
different stairs those were too crowded

393
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,750
maybe someone else should hold the door

394
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,430
evaluation is good it's not everything

395
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,240
you can evaluate only so much there's

396
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:04,120
only so many ways to hold the door so

397
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,860
communication major major piece here on

398
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,269
information sharing a lot of people have

399
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,380
done a lot of things across a lot of

400
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,730
different industries there's a lot of

401
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,230
best practices out there there's no

402
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,370
sense in recreating the wheel if you

403
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,360
guys are just down the street from each

404
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,949
other you know

405
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,600
Connecticut's big it's not that big

406
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:19,029
somewhere somebody should be able to

407
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,790
trade information breaking down silos

408
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,970
sharing information public/private big

409
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,050
big thing government private sector

410
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,839
increasing those lines of communications

411
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,269
makes a big deal to is not everybody has

412
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,930
the you know sole ownership over good

413
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,230
stuff verification measuring and

414
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,239
reporting progress on each

415
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,340
these principles as a way to sort of

416
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,420
focus improvement going forward I think

417
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:47,450
we'll see a lot of that and then so the

418
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,770
strategy is 20-something 30-something

419
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,750
pages long I should know that exact

420
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,569
answer by now and I don't I've blocked

421
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,460
it in my brain but it has a lot of stuff

422
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,620
in there these five themes it

423
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,080
specifically calls out in the beginning

424
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,940
saying these permeate through everything

425
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,400
and we've just talked about some of them

426
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,260
they do education and training everyone

427
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
everywhere at any level in any position

428
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,750
any desk always at the ready

429
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,250
everyone's always ready for good ready

430
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,080
to go so you've done your training

431
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,850
you've done your simulations you've got

432
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,100
the education great that's all there

433
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,110
we're closing the skills gap between

434
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,910
what people know and the skills that

435
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,280
exist in the state now versus what we

436
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,530
need going forward and I know skills gap

437
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,510
is a phrase that we apply across the

438
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,829
board you know put it in manufacturing

439
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,950
we have a huge skills gap put it

440
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,150
anywhere but in cyber particularly

441
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,100
information sharing we just talked about

442
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,699
threats and best practices break down

443
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,260
silos budget priority anytime you use

444
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,000
the word budget in Connecticut right now

445
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,540
everyone kind of like shivers a little

446
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,330
bit it's like a twitch but the idea is

447
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,280
that cybersecurity needs to be raised to

448
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,260
the level of any other general public

449
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,660
safety consideration any other budget

450
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,390
line item that has to do with police

451
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,189
fire anything like that cyber security

452
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,800
in some way shape or form needs to be at

453
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,840
that level it's an annual consideration

454
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,419
it's annually funded because it's such a

455
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,300
consistent part of our lives and it

456
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,790
permeates everything consistent adequate

457
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,190
funding everybody has a role to play we

458
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,170
talked about this too nobody's immune we

459
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,990
have a culture of security across our

460
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:24,050
state not just within an organization

461
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,630
same thing people at all up-and-down

462
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:29,960
levels are focused on this or at least

463
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,440
aware of what's going on and making it a

464
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,850
hallmark of the state making it as

465
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,890
business driver here like we talked

466
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,570
about increasing companies jobs

467
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,980
residents all those good things that we

468
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,050
want more and more of this is a great

469
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,210
way to do that because it's such a

470
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:48,990
growing field with such an extremely

471
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:50,820
high potential so what's next

472
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,159
one of the specific things this is

473
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,270
actually directly from the strategy and

474
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:56,640
we're talking about pulling together all

475
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,000
these clues to figure out what we can do

476
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,590
and what specific steps we can take

477
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,950
engage with the sector's put together a

478
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:07,020
plan action plans clarify the steps here

479
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,049
are the things that we should focus on

480
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,250
with our action plan whatever they may

481
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,168
be as they come up whether they're

482
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,510
industry specific whether they're across

483
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,279
the board whatever whether they come

484
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,529
through regulation whether they come

485
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,760
through tax credits however it happens

486
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,860
carrots or sticks here's what we're

487
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,720
focused on critical infrastructure

488
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,260
information sharing and closing the

489
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,570
talent gap law enforcement my favorite

490
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,539
is activate our citizenry to be lifelong

491
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,950
learners that's probably really super

492
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,620
specific and I'm sure we'll have an

493
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,169
entire way to regulate that coming up

494
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,590
shortly it's probably gonna be the most

495
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:47,880
low-hanging fruit out there so another

496
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:50,879
clue take it for what you will I like to

497
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,039
think of the strategy within the context

498
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,970
of the trends that we see across the

499
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,350
broader cyber industry and I say cyber I

500
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,120
say security someone else may say

501
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,980
InfoSec someone else may say risk

502
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,649
whatever same thing you know we're

503
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,659
talking about but the big trends that we

504
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:11,250
see that make a modern cyber security

505
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:14,250
program modern cyber security practices

506
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,960
within a company security to resilience

507
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,240
we're gonna dig into each of these here

508
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,100
but like I said I like lists security to

509
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,230
resilience planning and responds whole

510
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,129
of enterprise less firewall more

511
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,510
ecosystem so security to resilience this

512
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,149
is kind of the big one here that it's

513
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,950
not just and again this is gonna be a

514
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,418
whole big section in here that it's

515
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,799
gonna be preaching to the choir and if

516
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,130
it's not I'm sorry you're in the wrong

517
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,799
choir pay attention so security to

518
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,080
resilience it's not just how do you

519
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,629
defend yourself anymore it's you know

520
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,970
I'm gonna say the it's not if it's when

521
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,100
if I hear one more person say that's me

522
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,720
as if it was brand-new then I'm walking

523
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,949
out of whatever room I'm in so I have to

524
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,110
couch that with you I know you've heard

525
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,309
that a lot but it's relevant here for

526
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:00,990
this it's not just defense it's not just

527
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,820
keeping someone out it's assuming

528
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,470
they're going to get in

529
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,210
want to reduce the likelihood that they

530
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,919
come in but you also want to really

531
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,029
really improve your process for what the

532
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,820
hell you're gonna do when it happens

533
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:15,840
making sure that business continuity is

534
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,908
a huge focus not just getting your

535
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,500
systems back up and running but actually

536
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:23,100
making sure your company continues to

537
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,929
function evaluation and improvement are

538
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,990
a natural built-in piece of any

539
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,639
resilience effort making sure that

540
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,740
you're learning constantly from what

541
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:34,110
you're doing and I think a theme of

542
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,240
constantly doing something has been

543
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,758
running throughout this day from your

544
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,289
threat evaluations who whatever they

545
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,870
were talking about before and those

546
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,399
kinds of things but the idea that this

547
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,399
is always evolving there's nothing

548
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:51,268
static about cybersecurity if you become

549
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:55,279
static then you become stale training

550
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:58,379
and exercises can't just be focused on

551
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,539
you and your system they have to be

552
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:05,129
realistic if you're really going to test

553
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:07,110
a full plan across an organization small

554
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:09,209
medium or large there are ways to design

555
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,158
scenarios that give you a realistic

556
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,950
sense of what you can expect and I

557
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,690
really emphasize this coming from a

558
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,490
communications place because that is a

559
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,009
big piece of what I see a lot is

560
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,720
companies spending all this time and all

561
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:25,320
these resources and all these man-hours

562
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,059
on training to their plan exercising

563
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,610
accept their training to something

564
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,960
that's never in the world gonna happen

565
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,129
why are you spending so much time trying

566
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,990
to figure out whether or not you're CEO

567
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:36,090
can withstand some really tough reporter

568
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,980
questions if your CEOs in front of a

569
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,230
reporter you already lose you've already

570
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,360
done something very wrong so training

571
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,889
and exercises must be realistic to

572
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,330
really test the resilience of your

573
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,459
organization not just your defense

574
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,049
abilities so acknowledge they can get in

575
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,179
you should be able to mitigate the

576
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:55,679
damage without bringing down your

577
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:58,710
company for good resilience it's both

578
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,139
planning and response it's not just as

579
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,580
my plan really good you need a really

580
00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:03,779
good plan but then if you take that

581
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,100
really good plan you stick it on the

582
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:07,350
shelf and you pull it down and you start

583
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,449
trying to follow all those steps in the

584
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:13,678
you know fog of war after something's

585
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:16,140
happened again you already lose so the

586
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,610
ultimate price of a breach and

587
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,200
again I have an entire bullet up here

588
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,209
that I threw into Equifax because this

589
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,580
has been something that I have been

590
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,350
standing on my little soapbox screaming

591
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,520
about for ages and then they just walked

592
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,699
right into it and gave it a little

593
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,940
textbook example you can respond and

594
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,190
make it so much worse

595
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,570
you get breached it sucks something went

596
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,030
wrong it's gonna cost you money you're

597
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,270
gonna have to fix it all of that but if

598
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:45,149
you handle it so so so poorly in your

599
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,879
response your bad problem becomes a

600
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,800
ginormous problem nobody in a standard

601
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,020
data breach gets hauled before the

602
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,250
Senate Finance Committee you could hold

603
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,900
before Senate's Finance Committee

604
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,120
because there were so many headlines

605
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,500
about how you sucked then now the

606
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,739
senators want to ask you questions and

607
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,620
throw bombs at you so that to me comes

608
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,720
in that sort of non-traditional planning

609
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,449
stage that's where good communications

610
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,880
response plays in so reputation

611
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,130
resilience is a thing that I hammer on

612
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,560
all the time resilient networks are

613
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,600
great but if nobody trusts you enough to

614
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,970
use them after you clean it up who cares

615
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,010
you don't have a business anymore

616
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,750
somewhere somebody pays you to do

617
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,090
something and that's your business

618
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,070
whatever those things are fill in the

619
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,300
nouns how you will if those people stop

620
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,280
paying you you don't have a business

621
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,409
anymore so you have to maintain that

622
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,230
trust you have to maintain that loyalty

623
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,610
and a good response based on a good plan

624
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,610
lets you do that

625
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,680
non-traditional security functions yep

626
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,480
got all of that so it's not just putting

627
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,830
together plans to keep on the Shelf it's

628
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,270
pulling it off the shelf and having the

629
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,810
wherewithal to actually implement it the

630
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:58,770
right way the right way and the right

631
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:01,020
plan is more than just the IT team it's

632
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,280
more than just tech folks security folks

633
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,260
sitting in a corner going here's how

634
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,889
we're gonna make it all better you have

635
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,870
to have the whole team and no all crises

636
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,670
are not created equal all data breaches

637
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,649
are not the same you guys know this but

638
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,750
that also means that the response is not

639
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,210
always the same the building doesn't

640
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,770
burn down every single time sometimes

641
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,180
it's just a little spark and you know

642
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,420
maybe your desk catches on fire

643
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:27,030
fine that's a different kind of response

644
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,350
but a good plan fully built out and

645
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,910
comprehensive to all the different

646
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,830
possibilities of what may happen

647
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:34,020
what may be required in the event of an

648
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,970
incident have to bring in multiple

649
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,820
members of your team I loved that part

650
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,290
of I'm sorry I'm not skinning the room

651
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,889
fast enough if DevOps guy is still in

652
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:46,680
here but go make new friends step one go

653
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,840
make new friends go meet people in IT

654
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,580
legal Human Resources go meet your

655
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,639
communications team go meet procurement

656
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,689
all of those folks are going to have

657
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,700
somebody that they interact with

658
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,490
regularly outside of your company who

659
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,270
cares that this thing happened to you or

660
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,500
who may care and whether or not they do

661
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,660
you need to already have those

662
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,860
relationships in place so that you can

663
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,470
get that information to the right people

664
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:14,000
at the right times so your whole team

665
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:19,830
has to be a part of the solution here

666
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,820
and this is how good I am at trying this

667
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:26,820
is where we talk about it's not just you

668
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,830
it's not just what's in your network

669
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,020
what's in your system what data do you

670
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,870
own what users do you have what controls

671
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,300
are there you know what kind of

672
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:41,040
monitoring all of that you are now

673
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:44,639
responsible in more ways for that full

674
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,909
ecosystem that full ecosystem not only

675
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,560
can impact you and what you're

676
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,720
responsible for every day in your little

677
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,149
corner of the world but it can actually

678
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,140
impact your overall organization's

679
00:25:54,150 --> 00:26:01,380
ability to function look at target who

680
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,700
knows how they got hacked anybody I see

681
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,970
a lot of heads nodding so I'm gonna

682
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:09,000
start throwing out some words here yeah

683
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,290
the HVAC vendor you know who doesn't

684
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,980
actually control your point-of-sale

685
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:16,440
machines the HVAC vendor you know who is

686
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,130
a great fabulous weakest link the HVAC

687
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:24,390
vendor so let's just take that and put

688
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:27,480
it here you need to be responsible at

689
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:30,330
some level for the security across that

690
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,980
entire ecosystem and from the

691
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,990
perspective of a company and a business

692
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,690
that's used to being all internally

693
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,180
secure that sucks because that is a huge

694
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,480
shift in mindset that's a huge new

695
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,590
approach and so much more work it's also

696
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,169
an extremely

697
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,908
wired piece of the DFS regs that came

698
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:49,620
out so if you're subject to those or

699
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:51,419
you're working with someone who's

700
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,459
subject to those this is the piece they

701
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,929
hate the most it's also the piece that

702
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,570
they have two years to implement because

703
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,520
it's such a cumbersome process it's also

704
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:05,100
incredibly important because that's what

705
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,400
people are focusing on it now so action

706
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,469
plan these are the trends that we've

707
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,690
talked about we pulled some pieces here

708
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,450
and there from the strategy but now

709
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,940
specifically without knowing what

710
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,309
exactly you're gonna be required to do

711
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,289
by the state of the Connecticut in some

712
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:24,418
way shape or form whether it's going to

713
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:28,340
be actual regulations that are very

714
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:31,080
specific or whether it's going to be

715
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,699
less prescriptive one of the highlights

716
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,949
I think of the DFS regs is that they're

717
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,279
not prescriptive you're required to meet

718
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,140
functional steps along the way there are

719
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,240
functional requirements but it is left

720
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,919
open to the company to decide how best

721
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,380
to meet those functional requirements

722
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,659
given their specific situation and their

723
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,820
resources so as long as you have shown

724
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,399
that you have made a good-faith effort

725
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:58,110
to do these things nobody cares how you

726
00:27:53,399 --> 00:28:00,270
do it so the action plan the pieces that

727
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,570
I have pulled for this that to me are

728
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,480
the most obvious are the lowest hanging

729
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,950
fruit of what you should be doing anyway

730
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,590
you probably are doing these already if

731
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:14,130
you're not don't tell me but if you're

732
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:16,529
not these are the most basic immediate

733
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,779
actions that you can initiate tomorrow

734
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,760
you can't finish them tomorrow but you

735
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,880
can start them tomorrow start the

736
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,658
process that move you significantly

737
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,360
closer towards a full modern cyber

738
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:34,260
program program practice whatever you

739
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,870
want to call it so five steps so like

740
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,309
five more bullets this is important risk

741
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,139
assessment we're gonna do more with the

742
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:42,570
ecosystem we're gonna talk about I are

743
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,429
planning tailored solutions I think is

744
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,590
key we're going to talk about

745
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:49,440
off-the-shelf and why that's super

746
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,658
irrelevant and I think the opportunity

747
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,270
there's a huge opportunity for business

748
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,090
positioning and Industry advancement

749
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,340
here I think visa V competitors so

750
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:02,580
I think overlooking that would be you

751
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,830
know an unfortunate lost opportunity so

752
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,230
step one everything

753
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,970
should start with a risk assessment too

754
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,340
many companies just want to run out and

755
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,310
buy tech this tech that throw it in

756
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,429
we're secure not necessarily that's not

757
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,500
how it works probably not actually you

758
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,760
need to really understand the status quo

759
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,710
of what you're dealing with with your

760
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,480
company first the idea of a risk

761
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,540
assessment like I said not rocket

762
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,580
science but really important to

763
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,129
emphasize the value of starting right

764
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,320
there you need to know what is unique to

765
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,230
your company what do you have what's

766
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,760
valuable what's not valuable what's you

767
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,070
know rank it what's more or less

768
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,800
valuable you need to know where the

769
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,659
weaknesses are your people your systems

770
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,010
your vendors whatever that may be and

771
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,140
you need to know what the threats are

772
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,500
directed towards the type of valuable

773
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,210
information you have there's also a big

774
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,970
piece of this again putting back on my

775
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:59,400
little communications hat where there's

776
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,050
a whole element to a risk assessment if

777
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,850
you're really doing it right that

778
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,129
evaluates your standing in industry

779
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:09,000
because that will have a big say in how

780
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:11,010
people react to you if the goal of being

781
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,440
a resilient company is to make sure that

782
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,850
you still have a company when this is

783
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,920
all said and done and that maybe you can

784
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,929
still function while it's going on then

785
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,190
you need to know and have insight into

786
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,890
how people are going to react to what

787
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,630
happens to you so knowing what your

788
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,580
current industry positioning is knowing

789
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,490
what your current industry footprint is

790
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,260
particularly severe competitors who may

791
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,490
or may not have an opportunity for

792
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,560
themselves to take advantage of the

793
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:38,040
situation knowing that that's there is a

794
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,480
big deal knowing whether or not oh yeah

795
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,700
that's right we just screwed something

796
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,340
else up six months ago so they're

797
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,420
probably gonna take this news worse than

798
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,669
they would have otherwise

799
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:53,040
knowing that context is really important

800
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:55,320
so fully and comprehensively reviewing

801
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,990
the risks associated with your company

802
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,149
helps you determine where to allocate

803
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,980
your resources to shore up the weakest

804
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,630
links to plug the biggest holes and

805
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,680
you're not wasting time on things you

806
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,670
don't need particularly money and

807
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,680
everything comes back to resources

808
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,980
particularly when you're talking to as

809
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,280
he

810
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,440
audience so appropriately allocating

811
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,790
limited resources starts with a good

812
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,230
risk assessment so you know where they

813
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:25,020
need where you have a need for them

814
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:28,049
ecosystem due diligence this is almost

815
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:30,590
directly from DFS because I can get laid

816
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:33,870
it out really well from the DFS regs

817
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,970
you need to know what's in that third

818
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,590
party ecosystem not just that they're

819
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,720
there and you should probably ask them

820
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,830
some questions but you should really

821
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,210
know seriously know what the hell's

822
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,960
going on in their networks because they

823
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,150
are plugging into yours you want to

824
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,679
identify in it and this is again this is

825
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,480
big I'm not saying this like this is

826
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,250
something you can go out start it on

827
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,770
Monday you're done with it on Friday yay

828
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:57,510
good job no this is much longer than

829
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,629
that there's a reason this is the final

830
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,950
implementation step for DFS because it

831
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,690
takes the longest to do it right

832
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:08,390
particularly if you have thousands of

833
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:10,980
vendors not everyone will few but

834
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,220
identifying and assessing the risk that

835
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,570
comes from those third parties knowing

836
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,419
what they access what they do and really

837
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,280
having a handle on that matters due

838
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,140
diligence like you really have to put in

839
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,520
the work to evaluate their systems you

840
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,200
have to ask them questions you have to

841
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,030
go out and like poke things and see if

842
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
they work you have to go on-site and see

843
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,928
if it really is the way they're telling

844
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,750
you it is establishing minimum standards

845
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:35,940
within the contracts makes a huge

846
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,770
difference having actual contractual

847
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,360
obligations for these vendors to do

848
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,730
business with your company that says

849
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,270
they will maintain the standards of

850
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,410
security that you have set for them and

851
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,418
then periodically assessing that they're

852
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,400
actually doing it they didn't just do it

853
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,660
to get in the door once they're in the

854
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,549
door they have to keep doing it that's

855
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,870
not the point it's like getting into

856
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:58,620
college you got in now you have to keep

857
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:01,139
doing stuff so the ecosystem piece can

858
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,389
be small medium large it can be as

859
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,040
intensive as your organization decides

860
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,809
it's necessary necessary but some

861
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:13,350
version of due diligence has to happen I

862
00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:14,850
are planning this is my favorite place

863
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,530
where I pretty much play all the time so

864
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,389
I promise not to talk really 30 minutes

865
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:23,549
about this but basically a good ir plan

866
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,929
has very basic steps to it even a basic

867
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:27,239
ir plan that's not that

868
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:28,499
has a bunch of really basic boxes you

869
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:31,619
have to check and a bunch of basic steps

870
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:33,719
to take in my mind 75% of the work that

871
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,158
goes into taking those steps can be done

872
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,479
ahead of time you don't have to wait

873
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,059
until something blows up before you

874
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:41,849
actually start figuring out like I

875
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,928
wonder you know where our weak points

876
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:46,129
are well it's probably the thing that

877
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:47,909
just blew up so building your team

878
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:50,279
accounting for all the different

879
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:51,389
priorities across that team you know

880
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,700
there's gonna be a different set of

881
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:55,678
priorities and this is you know again

882
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,049
one of my personal favorite places is

883
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,339
understanding that your communications

884
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:01,440
and marketing team has a different set

885
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,729
of priorities than you do a different

886
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,729
set of priorities from the security

887
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:08,129
folks from the technology team from you

888
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:09,869
know the sales team but you all need to

889
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,520
be part of the same conversation so that

890
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:12,899
at a minimum you understand

891
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,359
that everyone else is bringing something

892
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,848
different to the table and all of that

893
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,710
doesn't just turn into giant fighting

894
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,270
and whoever's the loudest wins the plan

895
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,179
at the end of the day because that is

896
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,569
not a recipe for a good response

897
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,579
assigning your roles and

898
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:28,230
responsibilities so that's anything you

899
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,720
can do to minimize the amount of things

900
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,089
you have to do in the chaos of a breach

901
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,250
matters every little thing you can clear

902
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,750
off before something goes wrong helps

903
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,159
you assigning your roles and

904
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,719
responsibilities something that basic

905
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,460
who's responsible for talking to which

906
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,899
stakeholders who's responsible for

907
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,529
talking to the board who's responsible

908
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,440
for talking to you know the sales team

909
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:51,119
or the you know client management folks

910
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,819
like who's Manning the phones and who's

911
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,079
gonna get that guy information

912
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:56,668
establishing procedures how you're gonna

913
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,430
do things how information is going to

914
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:01,379
flow the background research that goes

915
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,419
into just knowing who your stakeholders

916
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,880
are how do you talk to them what do they

917
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,029
care about so that when you talk to them

918
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,529
later you don't anger them in the way

919
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:12,539
that you've spoken to them that was a

920
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:15,059
big problem with Equifax they put out

921
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,049
their first statement and the very first

922
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,450
thing they said was we're really

923
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:20,069
disappointed this happened you know what

924
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,359
so the hell is everybody else like no

925
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:25,680
one cares that you're disappointed you

926
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,140
just lost all my stuff so knowing who

927
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,549
your audiences are and why they are

928
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,288
gonna care that something happened to

929
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:33,660
you and how you should talk to them do

930
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:36,329
you need to build new channels do you

931
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,250
need to build new tools and then

932
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:38,550
training with realistic exercises we

933
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,290
talked

934
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,460
that nei airplane you put together you

935
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,340
got a trade and you got to train it the

936
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,660
right way

937
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,610
practice makes perfect when practiced

938
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,520
perfectly set ring a bell with anybody

939
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:53,010
anyone come from sports family anyway

940
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,300
that's relevant here if you have to

941
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,580
explain to you why if that's relevant

942
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,220
here then it's not worth the time but I

943
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,890
are planning super important super easy

944
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,240
to start and initiate and definitely

945
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,799
going to be a part of any requirement

946
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,450
that comes down the road because it just

947
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,000
is so significant these days in

948
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:14,399
determining the actual impact of an

949
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,580
incident solutions so tailored solutions

950
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,200
a lot of times you'll find a company or

951
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,880
an organization that hasn't put a lot of

952
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,080
thought into cyber yet and all of a

953
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,980
sudden they're like oh my god I have to

954
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,560
do something and they either run out and

955
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,120
they buy that box on the shelf and they

956
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,380
bring it home and they hand it to you

957
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,380
and they make you open it and do

958
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,670
something with it or the first three

959
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,020
vendors in the door get contracts

960
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,520
because oh my god we just need something

961
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,740
tomorrow

962
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,150
none of that actually is relevant for

963
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,339
your company it's not a smart way to

964
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,570
approach anything you guys know this a

965
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,290
lot of times that people cutting the

966
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,880
checks hopefully know that already but

967
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,620
it gets trumped in their head by the

968
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,800
sheer panic to just do something quick

969
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,089
quick quick so take the time now before

970
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,340
you're required to meet an

971
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,380
implementation deadline to actually

972
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,760
match solutions to need and this goes

973
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,990
back to your risk assessment you know

974
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,030
what your risks are you know what your

975
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,620
vulnerabilities are you know what holes

976
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,870
you need to plug you know what your

977
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,180
system requires go out and find things

978
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,790
that actually manage your specific risk

979
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,609
with your specific resources don't waste

980
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,110
your time on unnecessary shiny flashy

981
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,180
things that use all the right buzzwords

982
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,050
just cuz I walk in the door and I say oh

983
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,600
well my machine learning supercool

984
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:29,580
monetary control II thing don't buy that

985
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,160
unless that's what you need if that's

986
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,560
what you need cool buy it um good luck

987
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,690
with it but still you've done something

988
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,540
that's better than nothing so a lot of

989
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:42,060
these functions that must be met with

990
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,580
tailored solutions again stole a lot of

991
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,980
this from DFS because a lot of these are

992
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,020
the very basic requirements that covered

993
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,059
entities the companies who must meet

994
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,859
those regulations have to fill

995
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:57,369
and they're left open to decide how to

996
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,769
fill resources risk etc again show your

997
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:01,719
work on everything because that's what

998
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,808
the regulator's go back to to see that

999
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,650
you've really done this the right way so

1000
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:06,729
I'm not even gonna read through this

1001
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,160
list because this is all the stuff that

1002
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:11,049
you guys probably do and know and live

1003
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,089
in your sleep or at least pieces of it

1004
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:15,189
so somehow all of these functions have

1005
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:21,788
to be met cool do it in a way that meets

1006
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:23,859
you and then opportunity this is a

1007
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,079
little bit more jumping into what we

1008
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:28,660
said before if you view this as an

1009
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:33,029
opportunity to really implement and

1010
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:36,578
develop a risk-based cyber program then

1011
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:38,170
it's not a burden it's not a compliance

1012
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:39,910
burden it may be a burden because it

1013
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,619
will take time it will take resources it

1014
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,899
will take hours that you'd rather be

1015
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:47,949
spending I don't know doing something

1016
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:50,170
else but your company can take advantage

1017
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:52,209
of that moment in multiple different

1018
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,209
ways that they couldn't when they

1019
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:57,428
weren't doing it so one of the arguments

1020
00:38:55,209 --> 00:39:00,009
that's or complaints I should say that I

1021
00:38:57,429 --> 00:39:01,689
hear from folks a lot is that well this

1022
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:03,819
would all be super fun but nobody will

1023
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:05,499
approve my budgets nobody will give me

1024
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:07,719
the resources I need to like really do

1025
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:09,009
that's right okay well you're getting

1026
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:10,630
ready to have regulators breathing down

1027
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:13,359
your neck so someone's gonna decide you

1028
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:16,479
need to do this right this gives you an

1029
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,469
extra maybe a bigger stick to swing

1030
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,489
around and try and get some more money

1031
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:22,749
for your budgets yeah good for you

1032
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:24,549
providing a better customer experience

1033
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:27,339
this really gets into a lot of the like

1034
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:29,799
I don't know voodoo of the marketing

1035
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:32,288
world there are certain companies who

1036
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:36,670
shall remain nameless that are always at

1037
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:38,979
the top of customer trust surveys you

1038
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,109
ask customers who do you trust who are

1039
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:42,968
the financial services industry

1040
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:45,219
specifically do you trust and there is a

1041
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:47,739
specific credit card company that ends

1042
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,880
up in the top one two maybe three over

1043
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,949
and over and over and over and over

1044
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,569
despite the fact that they have been

1045
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:54,640
reached over and over and over and over

1046
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:58,509
and over you know why they mark it on

1047
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,308
security that is a big push for them as

1048
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:02,529
they reach out to their customers so

1049
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:03,910
they have become known as a secure

1050
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,380
company that really cares

1051
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,109
about their customers and their security

1052
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,730
if you actually care about your

1053
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:11,230
customers in security because you're

1054
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,579
doing all of these other things and

1055
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,220
you're actually implementing a

1056
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,630
comprehensive program it's always easier

1057
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,640
to sell something that's not so

1058
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,960
that's a good thing your marketing team

1059
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,500
will thank you because they actually

1060
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,900
have something cool to go talk about the

1061
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,700
overall business outlook this is a piece

1062
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,500
where again this will depend entirely on

1063
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,299
your organization on your company but

1064
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,589
the fact that you have brought different

1065
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:34,059
people from different parts of the

1066
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:35,410
organization together and you've locked

1067
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,670
them in a room and you've made them be

1068
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,920
friends with each other and you've made

1069
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,030
them trade phone numbers you made them

1070
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,549
all talk about their hopes and dreams

1071
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,680
and priorities can only work out well

1072
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:46,599
for your company it helps break down

1073
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,259
silos and anytime you're doing that for

1074
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:52,480
any purpose you will have second and

1075
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,789
third order effects that will benefit

1076
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,470
you from that so you know think about it

1077
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,819
as we're bringing everybody together

1078
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,049
okay you're not bringing everybody

1079
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:00,069
together everyone's not going to

1080
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,859
suddenly love each other and want to

1081
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:04,779
play more but the fact that you have

1082
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:07,630
forced people to at least acknowledge

1083
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,640
and learn something about other parts of

1084
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:13,390
your organization will make everything

1085
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,640
else function a little more smoothly and

1086
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,140
again part of the marketing thing if you

1087
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,089
start doing this now before you're

1088
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,740
required to do it then down the road

1089
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:22,270
everyone who's like oh sure they're

1090
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,848
requiring us to do this and they're

1091
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:28,599
scrambling you got this you have a leg

1092
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,960
ahead and depending on the advantage

1093
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,329
you're able to take of that situation

1094
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,410
puts you at a competitive advantage and

1095
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,670
that can actually make a big difference

1096
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,808
for your company and that's not

1097
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,579
something that you guys think about

1098
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,960
every day but there are a lot of people

1099
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,569
who paid a lot of money sitting on the

1100
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,160
other side of the building who do so if

1101
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:47,549
you can take something to them that

1102
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,509
helps them do their job more easily

1103
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:54,640
promise you everyone's gonna be happier

1104
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:56,589
in the long run so that is a very quick

1105
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,450
run-through and I'm looking at time I

1106
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:01,150
think I kind of nailed what I was aiming

1107
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,339
for there so that is like I said it's

1108
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,420
it's all guessing right now nobody knows

1109
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:05,799
exactly what anyone's going to be

1110
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,549
required to do but we have some really

1111
00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:11,440
good leads and we have some really good

1112
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:13,720
directional you know ideas of what may

1113
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,970
happen so if anyone has questions about

1114
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,118
any of that there was a lot of stuff all

1115
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:21,189
thrown in there and

1116
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,190
John very very lightly so yeah

1117
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:30,259
regulations that are necessarily needed

1118
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:42,259
so many of the corporations in

1119
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:45,890
Connecticut are just in terms of the

1120
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:50,180
demographics you've outlined so how do

1121
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:51,740
we if we the people come to that

1122
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:56,240
collective how do we get this shut down

1123
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:59,328
or at least how do we make it go to

1124
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,808
somebody else and not touch us that's

1125
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,700
what I think I heard you say right right

1126
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:13,609
how do we make it go be valuable for

1127
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:19,549
somebody else yeah no I think I think

1128
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:21,348
all and there's definitely I'm because

1129
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:24,140
we don't know what they're gonna be

1130
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:26,150
asking us to do I'm totally with you I

1131
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:29,140
think you know it's a coin toss right

1132
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:32,089
now as to whether or not we're gonna get

1133
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,379
heavy-handed redundant regulation oh my

1134
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:36,078
god this is the worst how do I kill it

1135
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,269
or we might get something that says

1136
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,069
great here are the things you need to be

1137
00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:42,879
doing just show us you're already doing

1138
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:46,910
them well how can make you do them again

1139
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,589
but we want to make sure I from again

1140
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,149
just from what I have seen in the

1141
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:52,849
strategy and knowing that there are all

1142
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,079
these other frameworks regulations

1143
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:55,970
requirements things out there that

1144
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,579
overlap on a lot of the industry that's

1145
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,019
here in Connecticut a lot of the

1146
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,059
requirements you already have to meet

1147
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:05,089
for different things I think the

1148
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:06,499
objective of this is not and again

1149
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:09,940
benefit of the doubt to them based on

1150
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:12,680
what we've seen so far is not to

1151
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,119
suddenly create these regulations that

1152
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,450
sweep across and that everyone now has

1153
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:20,660
to meet something new the idea is that

1154
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:22,730
there are spots that are within the

1155
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,180
different industries that are doing

1156
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,499
really well that do have really great

1157
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,210
comprehensive programs but it's not

1158
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:31,009
everybody and it's not across the board

1159
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,880
so let's find a way to

1160
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,860
raise the baseline level of security you

1161
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,060
know that sound I'm rolling my eyes at

1162
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,900
myself as I even say that because it

1163
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:43,009
sounds so cheesy but let's find a way to

1164
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,180
take all those places where there are

1165
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,650
gaps in their holes and there's people

1166
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,990
who aren't taking this seriously

1167
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:59,300
and let's raise them to that level so

1168
00:44:47,990 --> 00:45:01,669
that everyone is to an extent I think

1169
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,500
the municipalities are probably a little

1170
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,510
behind the curve but I would say they

1171
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:16,340
are not the only group I saw on that

1172
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:17,900
list who sometimes sucks at this you

1173
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:25,100
probably have an amazing system of

1174
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:27,620
culture that might be part of what comes

1175
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,060
out at this I think right now my

1176
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,620
understanding is that conversations are

1177
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,270
underway with different sectors and

1178
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,790
across different players within those

1179
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,490
groups to figure out what makes sense

1180
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:39,130
and it's not going to be some like voice

1181
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:41,359
in the sky oh man behind the curtain

1182
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:46,970
when I'm going to curtain whatever who

1183
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:49,610
says do these things it sounds to me

1184
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,140
like that is the plan I think that again

1185
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,760
it could go so many different ways and

1186
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,379
your version of what that should look

1187
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,610
like might be different from your

1188
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,350
version of what that should look like

1189
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,980
and I may think you're both crazy so

1190
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,299
there's a lot of room for subjectivity

1191
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:06,140
when it comes to this but I think there

1192
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:08,240
are some very basic understandings of

1193
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,400
what needs to be done and I think the

1194
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,470
municipalities absolutely are an area

1195
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,560
that have not always just based on

1196
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:18,379
simple size and capacity have not always

1197
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,940
taken this as a serious concern so

1198
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,990
there's definitely places where they

1199
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,930
have more work to do

1200
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,390
than others but you know I wouldn't let

1201
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,339
the rest of the the list off the hook

1202
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:30,470
and say oh I'm sure they're fine because

1203
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,210
they're probably not you know I think

1204
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,919
higher education is another similar area

1205
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,040
where there's a lot going on but it

1206
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,840
wouldn't be everything please go ahead I

1207
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,940
like things in groups of three draw

1208
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,580
chance

1209
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,250
huh what so let's say something really

1210
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:51,870
happens what should we as we the people

1211
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:55,280
expect for Malloy it depends on what

1212
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:57,930
happens I think one of the biggest

1213
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,040
misunderstandings of Adam not saying

1214
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,359
this is implied in your question but one

1215
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,310
of the biggest misunderstandings of

1216
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,540
someone who isn't in this space every

1217
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:08,060
day like we are is what can I expect

1218
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,080
from the law when something happens

1219
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,090
because it's never gonna look the same

1220
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,730
it depends on what happens you're gonna

1221
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:19,140
expect very different things from your

1222
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:23,880
government if a financial institution is

1223
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:26,100
breached or you know the sub-base goes

1224
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,930
down I mean there's a lot in between if

1225
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,310
the power grid goes down I want to hear

1226
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,540
a hell of a lot more from a lawyer than

1227
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:38,060
I do if you know UBS loses some stuff I

1228
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:42,290
think there's what you can expect is

1229
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:45,180
being proactive being involved I think

1230
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,220
what I counsel clients on when they're

1231
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,779
putting together plans for response and

1232
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,490
it's always on that what do we say what

1233
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,220
is our executives say what do we say as

1234
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:55,620
an entity and it's always you have to

1235
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,020
say something so if you're silent that's

1236
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,700
a problem you have to say something you

1237
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,900
have to address what you know while

1238
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,149
acknowledging you may not know

1239
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:06,150
everything and you have to do so in a

1240
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:09,240
way that makes me understand that more

1241
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:11,280
will be coming not that your story will

1242
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,740
be changing but that information will be

1243
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,800
updated as we have learned more and I

1244
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,020
think to me if there's more than that in

1245
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,150
the beginning of any kind of breach

1246
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,840
whether it's more you know an executive

1247
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:29,820
somewhere else having them be involved

1248
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,800
and to tell us in a transparent way the

1249
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,910
steps that are being taken to resolve

1250
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,290
that problem in addition to the steps

1251
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:39,529
that are being taken to make sure

1252
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:42,240
something else doesn't happen like it

1253
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:44,700
matter those are the things that to me

1254
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,680
would say good leadership good job got

1255
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,839
it okay you're on it your team is doing

1256
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,839
it I trust you to be taking care of this

1257
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,400
that helps

1258
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,880
silly complexity

1259
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:29,999
mm-hm

1260
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,430
yeah

1261
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,440
right I think that is one of the biggest

1262
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,490
challenges right now

1263
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:00,040
that organizations face is that in the

1264
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:03,040
grand scheme of things this concept of

1265
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,350
you know cybersecurity and regulating

1266
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,420
that cybersecurity the idea that cyber

1267
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,210
security is something that can be

1268
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:14,530
regulated is fairly new and the grand

1269
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:17,890
scheme of things so as industry industry

1270
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:21,040
groups States you know places like New

1271
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:23,589
York and others are starting to decide

1272
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,060
more needs to be done they're not seeing

1273
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,080
it move at the federal level sometimes

1274
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,640
they don't care if it's moving in

1275
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,430
federal level they just want to take

1276
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,379
care of their stuff because that's the

1277
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,940
nature of deep politics like that's how

1278
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,010
it works you want to take care of what

1279
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,410
you're responsible for and businesses

1280
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:40,780
such as yours and others that are across

1281
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:43,270
States you know throw in a whole new

1282
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:45,130
level of entities that operate on a

1283
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:49,780
global level and oh dear Lord I don't

1284
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:52,330
know how they do it but I think that the

1285
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,340
place in the trajectory right now where

1286
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,890
we find ourselves is that there's still

1287
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,540
more coming there's still more little

1288
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,670
odds and ends the patchwork quilt isn't

1289
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,380
done yet there are still patches being

1290
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,690
added to it with new states and new

1291
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,070
regulations coming and everyone's trying

1292
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,920
to scramble and figure out what to do

1293
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:10,210
you know a sign like you said while

1294
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,470
yours and exploits over here and over

1295
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,450
here and over here because everyone has

1296
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:17,049
to balance it out I think at some point

1297
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:19,149
we will see that pendulum swing and it

1298
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,910
will you know whether there is an

1299
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:23,590
uprising corporate America I don't know

1300
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:26,440
what it will be but I think eventually

1301
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:31,570
those state laws may not go away but we

1302
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:33,580
may see some type of money the direct

1303
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:36,550
forcing function but a really strong

1304
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:38,830
push towards a singular framework that

1305
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:41,350
people can use and I don't honestly

1306
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:43,120
think that in federal govern a long time

1307
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,310
I think we're ever gonna get a singular

1308
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:48,250
framework that everybody everywhere says

1309
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:50,920
yes we don't need HIPPA we don't need

1310
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:54,370
DFS regulations we've got this so we're

1311
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:58,330
gonna happen but you may find states

1312
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:00,819
agreeing to adopt similar frameworks

1313
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:02,769
that aren't creating such competing

1314
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,779
priorities and

1315
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:06,788
compliance issues for companies so I

1316
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:08,410
think I don't think we've gotten over

1317
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:11,799
that hump yet I think there's more still

1318
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:13,299
coming as it builds up but ideally at

1319
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:20,819
some point States and all will realize

1320
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:26,160
that balancing it out helps so good luck

1321
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:26,160
sorry next you and then it's over yeah I

1322
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:37,900
think the insurance piece is gonna be a

1323
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,308
big driver of a lot of it because I call

1324
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,680
cyber insurance the Giant Wild West

1325
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:43,359
right now because anything goes like

1326
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,470
talk about having to read the details I

1327
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,640
mean seriously you have to read the

1328
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,799
details because there could be anything

1329
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,980
in there and you could be paying for

1330
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:54,009
anything or nothing and not even know

1331
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,990
but I think that as the insurance

1332
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,869
policies are evolving and becoming more

1333
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:03,250
mature and companies are becoming more

1334
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:04,900
inclined to buy them and to have cyber

1335
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,670
insurance and are starting to demand

1336
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,460
coverage for things they didn't demand

1337
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:12,789
before I think there will be in a sense

1338
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:17,529
sort of a leveling out and standardizing

1339
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:19,930
there of what's acceptable for what

1340
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:22,690
becomes an acceptable base level of

1341
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:24,640
insurance coverage and requirements to

1342
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,559
get that insurance coverage that could

1343
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,109
be a framework that impacts or

1344
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,609
influences and applies to other you know

1345
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:32,769
states at all to I mean it's just

1346
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:35,589
another thing that companies have to

1347
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:37,209
comply with in order to get their

1348
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:39,819
insurance but it could be something

1349
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:44,279
where that becomes the thing that

1350
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:44,279
influences all the other new things help

1351
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:58,779
[Music]

1352
00:53:48,910 --> 00:54:00,009
I think the I actually honestly don't

1353
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,690
know the answer to that I don't know if

1354
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,570
this came from legislation or if this

1355
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:08,050
came from you know an order from the

1356
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:09,340
governor's office as a priority woke up

1357
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,250
on a Tuesday I thought it was a good day

1358
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:13,780
it initiated on Thursday I don't know

1359
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:18,820
I've seen strange things happen strange

1360
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:20,680
ways but um I think that to your point

1361
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,960
about people just kind of not really

1362
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:25,990
caring right now I think that's fine

1363
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,090
there's nothing care about its strategy

1364
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,319
you know the whole government produces a

1365
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,660
strategy every wouldn't say like

1366
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,270
whatever it's a strategy that's not true

1367
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:37,020
but they're pretty common so I think

1368
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,860
that people that's why the

1369
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,230
implementation plans and the action

1370
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:44,350
plans matter so much because you only

1371
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,600
make people care by forcing them to care

1372
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:48,100
it's it's a company it's a business it's

1373
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,049
an entity they don't care because they

1374
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,910
like to care about things they care

1375
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,860
because there's money somewhere involved

1376
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:56,109
and whether that's regulated

1377
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,150
requirements whether that's you know

1378
00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:01,420
sign they're gonna get hit with or

1379
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:03,850
something that's the time that they're

1380
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:07,150
going to care and my point about getting

1381
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:09,250
ahead of that curve is that there are a

1382
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:12,760
lot of things that you care about that

1383
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:15,100
this can help you drive that you can do

1384
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,610
now before it's a requirement so that

1385
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,569
when it becomes a forcing function it's

1386
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,370
not the big of a deal because you've

1387
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:29,920
already done it or you've done a good

1388
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:32,490
chunk of it anyway yep yes it's all over

1389
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,490
I reckon flip back

1390
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:57,250
my expectation and again not based on

1391
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,230
any knowledge that's legit is that it

1392
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,960
will be a way to facilitate information

1393
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:04,240
sharing both within industries and

1394
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,790
between the government and the private

1395
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,990
sector because there's so much Intel

1396
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,250
there's so much knowledge and it's not

1397
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,270
just about threats that's the most

1398
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,160
obvious thing that people talk about

1399
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,170
with information sharing but it's also

1400
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,520
best practices it's also things that

1401
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,820
work things that don't work things

1402
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,440
you've tried etc but there were a lot of

1403
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:23,080
different places throughout the strategy

1404
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:28,170
where they reference facilitating the

1405
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,170
sharing of information I think there

1406
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,098
there are a lot of pockets of knowledge

1407
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,109
and a lot of pockets of information and

1408
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:37,270
Intel that exists both within you know

1409
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:41,109
from something as obvious as the FBI to

1410
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:43,509
state government to you know large like

1411
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:46,630
financial institutions that do this

1412
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:48,310
themselves and I think that one of the

1413
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,220
main things we'll see come out of it

1414
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:54,220
that's not really a regulatory type of

1415
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,169
thing is the creation of entities to

1416
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:59,319
facilitate the exchange of information

1417
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:01,420
because the you know the more you know I

1418
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,800
think that's gonna be a big piece that

1419
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,510
comes out of this so whether it's

1420
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,710
between law enforcement and industry

1421
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:08,920
whether it's between government and

1422
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:10,119
private you know there's not really a

1423
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,330
good way as the federal government's

1424
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:16,660
been learning to mandate sharing but

1425
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:19,450
finding ways to facilitate sharing can

1426
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,009
go a long way so my expectation is that

1427
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,348
we'll see something that takes that kind

1428
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:26,200
of a shape that isn't just the forcing

1429
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:27,550
function of a regulation so there could

1430
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,348
be there could be something good you

1431
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:33,190
never know you never get out there

1432
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:35,670
should be something valuable here yes

1433
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,670
that's what

1434
00:57:40,720 --> 00:58:08,870
yeah yep I think it would not be

1435
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,580
far-fetched to expect that somewhere at

1436
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:14,509
the end of the day the government will

1437
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,310
make some money off of this I think

1438
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:21,710
that's I think that's probably not crazy

1439
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:24,140
now I'm you preaching to the government

1440
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:27,380
choir like I'm I am cynical I was

1441
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,180
cynical in it but you know to be cynical

1442
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,790
and Mike I'll show you an idealistic at

1443
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:34,819
the same time but you can do it I think

1444
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:38,840
it's absolutely seeing something along

1445
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:41,300
the way that involves a fine I don't

1446
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:45,010
think it would be crazy and oh so that

1447
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:48,710
fine happens to go back to Hartford oh

1448
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:50,180
that was surprising I think that's

1449
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:54,110
that's not going to be super far-fetched

1450
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:57,740
but whether it's something as crazy and

1451
00:58:54,110 --> 00:59:01,850
intense as GDP are or something that

1452
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:03,410
still is kind of TBD like DFS's to an

1453
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:05,540
extent like you know we've just took the

1454
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:08,180
first deadline still kind of waiting to

1455
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:10,970
see what that shapes up to be for the

1456
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:21,319
long haul or whether it falls somewhere

1457
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:24,140
in between I don't know yes yes yeah

1458
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,340
there that might be a fun little

1459
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,549
secondary reason that that

1460
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:31,340
implementation timeline is two years

1461
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:33,830
yeah so I think we're anywhere I've done

1462
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,190
thanks thanks for the 98 percent of you

1463
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,190
say Rick
