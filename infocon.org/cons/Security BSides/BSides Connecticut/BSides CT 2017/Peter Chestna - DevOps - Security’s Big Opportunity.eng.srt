all right so that was a good talk let's

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,990
let's give a next round of applause for

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:13,139
Peter chestnut DevOps Security's big

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:16,230
opportunity thank you everyone

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,730

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,369
I speak I speak at a lot of conferences

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,840
I was in Dusseldorf Germany yesterday so

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,279
if I'm a little tired that's probably

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,430
why one raised our hands

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,220
one one hand see is the problem people's

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,109
arms are rusty I try again when I ask

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,640
questions is good to get like response

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,579

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,140
right so a little bit about myself

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,739
longtime developer so I came to InfoSec

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,559
through vera code so 25 years of

17
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,149
developer a lot of experience in

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,550
application security all right this is

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,719
my 12th year at vera code yeah anyone

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,218
heard of our code anyone a customer code

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,910
nobody oh great room full of prospects

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,410
love it all right I've done a lot of

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,148
development stuff what I'm here to talk

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,280
to you about is helping you understand

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,290
how developers think and how to get them

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,909
to work with you instead of against you

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,920
won't have that problem

28
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,420
yes we're developers working against you

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,610
I have done a crap-ton doing waterfall

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,840
to DevOps monolith the micro services I

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,689
understand the architecture is the

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
different methodologies and I consult

33
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,860
with the largest companies of the world

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,040
on how to roll out successful apps tech

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,460
programs so please feel free to ask

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,820
questions reason that I am so passionate

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,539
about applications security we're in the

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,639
DHS 90% of the breaches occur in some

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,259
form or fashion through software now

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,329
it's not necessarily the software that

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,520
we create it can be the software that we

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,679
buy you know do you look at your

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,960
software supply chain before something

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,439
gets installed into your networks I

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,429
don't know that you do if we take a look

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,079
at what we protect and how we protect it

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,659
oftentimes when I go into a prospect

48
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,508
they talk about securing the important

49
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,429
stuff all right well that wouldn't have

50
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,770
protected you in the case of target they

51
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,239
didn't get in through the main target

52
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,310
website or any of that stuff it was

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,260
social engineering

54
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,300
small shop that did their HVAC that went

55
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,519
to their billing system that I mean

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,610
their network now I get everywhere so

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,090
really it's not about securing just the

58
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:29,690
important things open source so you know

59
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,220
great current thing now I'm gonna

60
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,510
challenge a couple of speakers that have

61
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,830
already been up here and talking about

62
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,929
the fact that Equifax chose not to patch

63
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,140
or as knew it and did nothing

64
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,340
I will assert to you with pretty pretty

65
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,160
good certainty that they didn't even

66
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,410
know that they were vulnerable right in

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,640
the case of struts that's an easy one I

68
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,440
had a good conversation with some people

69
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,760
at lunch today it's like alright so

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,319
struts you could probably go around and

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,120
ask you developers do you use struts to

72
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,768
use struts and figure out whether or not

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,760
you even have it in your enterprise but

74
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,310
what if it's something like Apache

75
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,099
Commons do you use Apache Commons I

76
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,330
don't know I use JBoss the answer to

77
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,950
that question is yes if you're using

78
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,110
that or if you're using strut it gets

79
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,880
pulled in but way down deep it's not a

80
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,799
first-class citizen of something that

81
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,180
you import into your project cuz I have

82
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:20,720
to have Apache Commons alright so who

83
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,090
has an abstract program no really nobody

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,380
I've got one guy two three come on they

85
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,380
see the arms still aren't working for

86
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,450
okay well alright who wants it aspect

87
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,730
for round you don't have any of your

88
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,078
company really so it does it look like

89
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,530
this or does it look more like this

90
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:42,769
because more often than not you know

91
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,139
it's the sea snow I am the director of

92
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,420
no I will tell you you cannot ship your

93
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,970
application because it has stuff wrong

94
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,649
with us we are not enabler as we stay in

95
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,730
there at the end when they're ready to

96
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,590
go out the door you on a Friday

97
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,328
afternoon at five o'clock is like I want

98
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,609
to get home like nope you can't leave

99
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,639
yet I still got some more work for you

100
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,739
to do now typically in companies that

101
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,819
have an application security program I'm

102
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,600
going to see a couple of different

103
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,638
outcomes right if I have an app set

104
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,620
program and I have rules and regulations

105
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,459
for what can be and cannot be inside of

106
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:19,910
an application oftentimes I see this

107
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:21,890
right there's a gate but it's either

108
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,890
they don't have to follow the process

109
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,550
because there's no mandate or it's the

110
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,110
escalating phone calls

111
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,520
wanted to make an exception so I'm gonna

112
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,440
call my boss who calls the air boss

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,919
eventually we have the CIO and CEO says

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,210
we have to ship this because I own the

115
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,030
amount of money that we make in here and

116
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,729
I need this feature to enable sales so

117
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,429
it becomes a PL problem and not really a

118
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:48,449
security problem or if we do have a gate

119
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,400
it's usually this developers ignore the

120
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,009
fact that they're going to have to do

121
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,599
security vulnerability testing they get

122
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,159
to the end we do our pen testing who

123
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,280
does pen testing other applications in

124
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,710
their enterprise ok they get they're

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,210
like oh sorry can't go they were hoping

126
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,590
the gate wasn't real with some figment

127
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,719
of their imagination now the reason that

128
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,758
I'm here is because the times have

129
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:13,770
changed for how we build and ship

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,719
software and it's important for you to

131
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,758
understand that because the stuff that

132
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:19,860
you do today the things like pen testing

133
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,069
while still relevant and I'll show you

134
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,460
where are not the be-all end-all we

135
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:29,909
can't do it at the end anymore so if you

136
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,719
look at team sizes and release timelines

137
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:34,949
for waterfall anyone doing waterfall

138
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,719
it'd be proud it's okay

139
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,479
been doing it since the 50s why

140
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:40,590
shouldn't we continue to do it exactly

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,659
we're talking one to four releases a

142
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,060
year it's really slow and I got a big

143
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:46,440
team doing it too now this is the nice

144
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,060
thing about this for security is it

145
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,409
moves so slow that we can kind of keep

146
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,469
up with them almost kind of right now if

147
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,750
we start moving into agile agile we're

148
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,629
talking about doing one or two releases

149
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,240
a month or we're really starting to cook

150
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,900
now how do i do pen testing if I'm

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,360
releasing twice a month I don't know if

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,549
you have an in-house maybe you could do

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,779
it but that would just encount that

154
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,300
allow you to do the testing never mind

155
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,800
any remediations or mitigations that you

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,870
would have to do on that and it's a very

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,180
small team moving really quickly

158
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,389
sometimes multiple teams combining into

159
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,620
a single application if we get to DevOps

160
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:33,840
now we are haulin ass we're talking

161
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:37,830
about multiple times a day and hundreds

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,888
of times a year there is no way to pen

163
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,669
test everything that goes out the door

164
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:47,659
if you're using DevOps who here is doing

165
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:50,568
DevOps in their in their shops some

166
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:52,069
people may be kind of alright good this

167
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,969
future stuff so let's explain a little

168
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:57,680
bit how we got here so this is what

169
00:06:54,969 --> 00:07:00,080
waterfall looks like I've got my silos

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,550
of responsibility and those very much

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,378
follow the way the built we build the

172
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,539
software right someone tells me what I'm

173
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,310
going to build then I go design it and I

174
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,990
coat it and then I test it and then I

175
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,870
test it some more and then I go out the

176
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,180
door with it right now the problem with

177
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,610
this is I lose fidelity as soon as I do

178
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,810
that handoff from the time that the

179
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,729
person says here's what we're going to

180
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,229
build so the time that it gets to the

181
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,909
people at operations or the people in

182
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,199
security I don't know why I built it I

183
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,960
don't know who I built it for I don't

184
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,020
know what it's supposed to do that is a

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,159
huge gap that makes these people just

186
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,719
have to be reactive similarly with the

187
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,389
people that build the application so our

188
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:40,370
developers they know the choices they

189
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,289
made they know the trade-offs they made

190
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,479
but by the time that gets down to

191
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,400
operations they know they went the way

192
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,020
it was intended to run but operations

193
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,839
know how it actually runs in a

194
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,389
production of our wood production data

195
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,889
and the problem there is their

196
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,750
information never makes it back so they

197
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,949
go crisscross so I don't understand the

198
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,629
trade-offs they made or why they made

199
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,099
them I'm just angry because the thing

200
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,229
shows up and it's on fire all the time

201
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,449
and I have to kick off these scripts

202
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,620
every day because you have resource

203
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,189
leaks and I have to make sure the

204
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,949
process stays up it just it sucks so

205
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,990
enter agile now in agile the first thing

206
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,759
that we did was we started to combine

207
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,250
some concerns which is what we're going

208
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,870
to get to with DevOps really we started

209
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,779
to combine the concerns of development

210
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,819
and quality in the old days in waterfall

211
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:28,849
we'd say the developers say I am done I

212
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,409
coated it here you go we throw it over

213
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,849
the wall we go off and do something else

214
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,010
quality people will come back and say

215
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,958
yeah not really here's all the crap

216
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,510
that's broken well the stuff that I

217
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,549
broke let's say worst case I did once a

218
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,069
year two deployments maybe January first

219
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:46,579
I wrote the problem Virginia way second

220
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,550
I wrote the problem I'm finding it on

221
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:52,459
December 30th how many decisions were

222
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,270
made based upon that one bug along that

223
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,890
entire

224
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,720
here that are now gonna have to get

225
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,220
revisited and retested so it's really

226
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,240
not a very good run way to run an

227
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,010
airline so we started to say alright

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,600
we'll combine them and they'll say you

229
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,600
know what you're responsible equality is

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,330
not done until it's tested so I built it

231
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,340
we test it and then we say done and it

232
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,530
goes out the door but we still have this

233
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,690
problem right so we've still had losing

234
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,610
business intent we're still losing

235
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,860
application knowledge and we're not

236
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,140
getting any feedback on how the thing

237
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,640
actually performs unless we get to call

238
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,230
into some incident where our productions

239
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,560
down and we've got to go in and try to

240
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,060
figure out what happened so after DevOps

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,369
or in this case def seconds because it

242
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,910
actually have security in there high

243
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:40,000
card security love you guys because

244
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,650
we're all in the room when we talk about

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,100
functionality because we're all in the

246
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:49,790
room we talk about testing and

247
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,890
requirements and operations we have

248
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,569
really good continuity so we can start

249
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,180
to give each other feedback in the room

250
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,970
in that team about how things are

251
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,969
running now let's think about this from

252
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,790
a technology point of view in waterfall

253
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,130
again once a year or maybe twice a year

254
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm doing deployments if a test takes me

255
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,950
two days and it is grueling and sucky

256
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,209
like this now some people choose to do

257
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:19,910
this for fun that's not me

258
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,920
if it if it sucks it takes me two whole

259
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,410
days to do it it's just there are tears

260
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,750
in my eyes when I'm doing this thing but

261
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,020
it's gonna take me three weeks to

262
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,810
automate that that means my pay at my

263
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,250
payback is not four years I might not

264
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,359
even be working at the company why would

265
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,620
I do it you know what I'll just deal

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,180
with it I'll grit and grin and bear it

267
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,760
and we'll get through it and we'll do it

268
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,290
again next year when you start to shrink

269
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,010
those timeframes and now we're doing a

270
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,050
release once a month or twice a month

271
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,760
things need to be repeatable now so I

272
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,770
have to think about putting some

273
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,240
automation in and saying when I run the

274
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,130
test it better run the same way every

275
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,600
time because I have to trust that

276
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,510
machinery in order to make these

277
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,120
releases happen when we get the dev ops

278
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,830
all bets are off everything is automated

279
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,920
everything if you can find a way to

280
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,480
automate it you

281
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,529
have to because it will just slow you

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,000
down okay I'm gonna make the presumption

283
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,920
because you guys aren't good at raising

284
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,110
your hands that someone wants me explain

285
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,969
this agile process so this is typically

286
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,370
thank you this is typically the way

287
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,720
DevOps is rung it's run on an agile

288
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,769
methodology whether that be agile scrum

289
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,470
or agile Kanban this is agile scrum here

290
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,180
so the guy on the left with his with his

291
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,250
the little light on his head is our

292
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,769
product owner that is a role inside of a

293
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,389
scrum team his job is to look into the

294
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,339
future and decide what the most

295
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:40,310
important thing is for us to build and

296
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,510
he's gonna build a list of those now

297
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,888
dissimilar from what we would do in

298
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,180
waterfall would say I need to know

299
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,850
everything we're gonna build for an

300
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,120
entire year for this I only need a

301
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,320
couple of weeks all right or maybe one

302
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,440
week I need to know what the most

303
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,279
important things are for us to do now

304
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,680
things that will customers will actually

305
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,110
buy so I'm gonna prioritize that list

306
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,370
now we're going to go into between the

307
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,050
prioritization and the planning we're

308
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,430
gonna go into what's called a grooming

309
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,689
session now write that one down because

310
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,209
this is the one that you guys want to

311
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,290
start thinking about attending inside of

312
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,420
a grooming session we're going to talk

313
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,069
about the story we're going to talk

314
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,420
about what the use case is who we're

315
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,220
building it for why we're building it

316
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,839
and we're going to make sure that as a

317
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,459
team we understand it so let's say these

318
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,980
these first three rows here this is my

319
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:24,209
scrum team we're going to do something

320
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,070
call it we're gonna test for

321
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,290
understanding and we do this through

322
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,790
something called planning poker so

323
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,170
there's actual physical decks of cards

324
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,730
you can actually get it on your phone as

325
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,930
well you go into this meeting we talked

326
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,420
about a feature and we're gonna talk

327
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,649
about how big this is how long do we

328
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,779
think that's going to take us so we do

329
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:42,029
this in what's called story points their

330
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,350
virtual some people tie it to hours or

331
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,420
days except early you're not really

332
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,209
supposed to musical say this is some

333
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,229
understood quantity of complexity and so

334
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,209
we're gonna say is it bigger or smaller

335
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,310
and by how much so what I'm holding in

336
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:56,160
my hand is a 1 a 2 would be twice as

337
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,849
hard a 1/2 would be half is half as hard

338
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,050
a 20 would be really long so on three

339
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,279
we're going to talk about two stars I

340
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,899
say on three everyone throw their card

341
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,180
they were gonna pick up a card so I'm

342
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,810
gonna get a half from him I'm gonna get

343
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,810
a 5 here a 20 and a 13 I'm like when you

344
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,189
don't understand jack about this story

345
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,930
right clearly there's something missing

346
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,500
so why do you think it's so easy why do

347
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,689
you think it's so hard

348
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,280
talk about it together to make sure we

349
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,660
come to some common understanding until

350
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,550
we throw something like maybe maybe it's

351
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,199
a five or an eight this is a Fibonacci

352
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,339
ish sequence so we're gonna get to that

353
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
understand and say alright this is a

354
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,940
five all right now we're gonna have some

355
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,130
understanding of how fast our team can

356
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,840
move and where I have this what's called

357
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,900
velocity how many story points per

358
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,910
sprint to do we get done so in our

359
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,280
planning session we're gonna as a team

360
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,569
say we are committing to do the first

361
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,100
three stories let's say so that means

362
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,600
that's all we're going to do that entire

363
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,130
sprints think about those three things

364
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,350
so every single day we go into what's

365
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,300
called a stand up and a stand up is five

366
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,670
to ten minutes you answer three

367
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,870
questions what I do yesterday what am i

368
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,479
doing today and is there anything

369
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,000
blocking me these are run by what's

370
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,120
called a scrum master now they are not

371
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,040
the boss of the team they are a servant

372
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,800
leader their job is to unstick people so

373
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,310
if he says I'm really stuck on this I

374
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,930
need an answer from security on a

375
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,869
question that I gave them my job is to

376
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,420
make sure he gets that answer other

377
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,360
things that we'll uncover is maybe he's

378
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,069
finished early and he's running long hey

379
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,330
can you combine with him and go work

380
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,070
with him and help bring that story

381
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,070
because what we want to do as a team is

382
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,040
get to everything that we committed to

383
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,990
finish the work that we set out to do

384
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,969
we'll track that and then at the end

385
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,350
we'll do a demo to our product owner who

386
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,040
will either accept or reject the work

387
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,810
and we'll do a retrospective so it's

388
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,569
usually what went well what didn't go

389
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,369
well and how do we improve and when I

390
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,650
was a scrum master it was what stuck

391
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:04,150
with what didn't suck and how can we

392
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:06,760
suck less the next time now in this

393
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,079
process security is usually not involved

394
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,370
which is why I'm calling out these

395
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,400
ceremonies because this is where you

396
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:17,260
guys are all right I hope they do it

397
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,569
right I what are they building over

398
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,589
there and what you end up fighting for

399
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,940
is budget you come in at the end after

400
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,640
your pen test or after your

401
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,590
vulnerability assessment say here's 50

402
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,930
things I need you to fix them all

403
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,600
shipping tomorrow or we're shipping next

404
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,010
week can I just fix the important ones

405
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,890
anyone heard that one before

406
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,439
how about just the important ones you

407
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,630
will never get all 50 maybe you get five

408
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,890
maybe you get none maybe a ten but

409
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,779
you're fighting for that budget with the

410
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,000
team and what happens to the rest of it

411
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,790
goes to the bottom of backlog never to

412
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,200
be seen or heard from again

413
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,120
right so it gets buried because we've

414
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,339
surfaced it too late we found risk in

415
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,210
the project too late for the business to

416
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:05,570
do anything about it alright now let's

417
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,070
talk about DevOps this is my favorite

418
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,580
quote this is the one that I leveraged

419
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,470
from Nathan Harvey from chef this talks

420
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:15,320
about the entire organization a

421
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,390
high-velocity organization is not just

422
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,550
about a team it's not just about dev and

423
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,529
ops working together that's not what it

424
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,729
is

425
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:28,850
if I am shipping software twice a day

426
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,440
let's take the case of my guy that's

427
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,750
running support so here's my support guy

428
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,430
over here I shipped a new feature

429
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,589
yesterday because I shipped multiple

430
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,050
times a day phone rings picks it up says

431
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:40,700
hello can I help you yeah this feature

432
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,030
I'm trying now doesn't work he's like

433
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,830
what new feature how does the team

434
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,240
communicate to the business to say we

435
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,380
release this new feature are the sales

436
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,089
guys out in the field that are out there

437
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,230
to communicate about it and say hey

438
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,339
here's what's coming up here's what

439
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,560
we're doing here's what we ship

440
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,210
yesterday how do we do that as an

441
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,469
organization how does the security team

442
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,240
become aware of all the things that

443
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,490
we're doing to make sure that they're

444
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,170
involved in the beginning stages so when

445
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,770
I talk about a DevOps team when I go to

446
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:13,069
a customers usually this

447
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,510
it's about release management glorified

448
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:16,188
release engineers they write a bunch of

449
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,629
scripting they automate stuff so that's

450
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:23,240
DevOps for us okay that is not DevOps

451
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,530
because remember that last picture where

452
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,260
I talked about everyone being in the

453
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,360
same room it has to be this has to be

454
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,129
the person that writes it is responsible

455
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,899
for monitoring it and responsible for

456
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,530
operating it if they don't then they

457
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,090
won't ever change what they do if they

458
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,740
write crappy software and they write

459
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,330
crappy logging and they don't have any

460
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,830
monitoring and they can't go and debug a

461
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,059
problem when they get woke

462
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,460
up at 2:00 in the morning instead of the

463
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,350
ops guy maybe they're gonna think a

464
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,899
little differently about their behavior

465
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,959
when they're writing their software this

466
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:58,799
is why DevOps is awesome it drives the

467
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,460
right behaviors all right so we're

468
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,460
security usually you guys know where it

469
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,169
is yep yeah that's right there it's it's

470
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,899
most of the time that's where I find it

471
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:12,929
it can't be

472
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:14,309
security is whose job everyone's we got

473
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,350
to do it all the time we've got to think

474
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,639
about it we have to help people get this

475
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:22,980
accomplished all right so here's my

476
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:25,799
strategy again I talked to a lot of

477
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,399
companies and I know and have seen

478
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,299
things that have and have not worked so

479
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:33,120
first of all we're gonna start with

480
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,559
relationships and accountability most of

481
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,989
the time when I talk to people their

482
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,960
problem isn't their tools they have

483
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,549
tools that can find stuff what they

484
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,940
can't get is developers to actually do

485
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:49,730
anything about it if you don't fix that

486
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:54,049
problem you might as well stop we have a

487
00:18:49,730 --> 00:19:00,630
customer that for five years five years

488
00:18:54,049 --> 00:19:03,000
scanned everything fixed nothing why are

489
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,100
you spending this money it's a waste of

490
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
time and a waste of energy if you can't

491
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,678
get your developers to fix what you find

492
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,230
you're just negligent training and

493
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,139
remediation coaching so to the previous

494
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:19,409
talk here talking about what do our

495
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:22,199
developers know about security and it's

496
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,539
usually dis and it's not that it's it's

497
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,850
not their fault when they went to

498
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,370
college so I went to college back in the

499
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,719
late 80s and early 90s they didn't have

500
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,000
that in college

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,539
barely today can you find courses on it

502
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,029
and barely ever are they required we are

503
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:43,019
not teaching people how to write secure

504
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,860
software so guess who has to do it we

505
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,200
have to do it

506
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,479
our company has to bear that cost now

507
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,450
you have this huge work force

508
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,899
nobody knows jack so we have to teach

509
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,899
him jack

510
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,420
and this for us so oftentimes this is

511
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,040
this is the way security does releases

512
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,270
white-knuckle all the way through we

513
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,800
gotta test everything I got to get it

514
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,889
all done I got that know everything

515
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,620
about everything we can't do that if

516
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,180
we're in a world where if our company

517
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,330
doesn't start releasing faster we're

518
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,670
going to not be a company anymore

519
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,169
especially in a financial industry

520
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,750
there are a lot of upstarts that are

521
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,270
coming in with Greenfield I got a new

522
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,290
package we're gonna build it all in

523
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,510
right from the start

524
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,270
I got CI CD pipelines that shoot me

525
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,190
right out the door so I can do that

526
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,690
stuff really fast guess what they start

527
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,660
leapfrogging those companies that are

528
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,620
doing waterfall so when I talk to

529
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,050
companies they're a little bit of

530
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,850
panicked I have to get the DevOps

531
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,500
because I'm losing business someone's

532
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,030
coming in and eating my lunch there's

533
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,120
this new market segment we want to go

534
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,460
address I can't do it for nine months

535
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,139
how do I keep living how do I keep

536
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:57,300
making money as a company okay

537
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,090
relationships who knows their peer and

538
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,300
development show hands

539
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,800
excellent a couple you have to all right

540
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:09,389
actually let me ask this or any

541
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:12,389
developers in the audience yeah okay do

542
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,140
you know your security peer oh you're

543
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,050
both all right

544
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:21,330
that's easy you talk to yourself every

545
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:23,250
day if it's those developers if it's

546
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,740
those security people where are we

547
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,820
getting if it's Jim or Bob or Jane or

548
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,350
Susan over in security now I'm starting

549
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,750
to get somewhere I have some kind of

550
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,110
personal relationship do we understand

551
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:39,030
how they're gold now in the in the world

552
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,709
where we start we get to DevOps once we

553
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,230
started to release from once a year

554
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,790
where operations could say yeah I can I

555
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,960
can watch the software as it goes and I

556
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,760
can figure out how everyone said by the

557
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,080
time you kids say I'll be fine to them

558
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,640
shipping twice a month where the thing

559
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,780
is always on fire when they install it

560
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,080
they have to go back and try to figure

561
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,330
it out because the developers are gold

562
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,540
to release fast that's all their gold to

563
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,730
do get it out there and make it quick in

564
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:07,889
the operations guys I want everything

565
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,660
I want to look like a mirror those two

566
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,880
things are in conflict they are not gold

567
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,790
the same but we throw them on the same

568
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,080
team and they start to figure it out

569
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,450
right they start to work together such

570
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,580
that both their goals are met they can't

571
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,559
be in that conflict so you have to

572
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,928
understand how your developers are gold

573
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,280
to be able to understand the things that

574
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,030
they have to live with and the choices

575
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,410
they have to make

576
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,750
they're usually giving you that stiff

577
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,220
arm not because they couldn't care about

578
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,390
security but because they're not paid to

579
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,340
care it's an important point here if I'm

580
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,870
not paid if part of my bonus at the end

581
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,178
of the year has nothing to do with

582
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,610
application security when you call up

583
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,380
you think I'm gonna answer when you send

584
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,549
me that PDF or spreadsheet with all the

585
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,100
vulnerabilities you want me to fix you

586
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:53,790
think I'm gonna go do anything with it

587
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:55,199
mm-hmm you got to understand what they

588
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,820
struggle with so part of the reason for

589
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,290
walking through that agile methodology

590
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,500
and talking to you about DevOps and how

591
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,450
stuff is done you need to understand how

592
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,650
the sausage is made I was in Germany

593
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:09,330
yesterday which is a perfect place to

594
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:12,270
talk about sausage you need to meet with

595
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,770
them lunch go to some of their meetings

596
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,970
you don't have to go to all of them but

597
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,889
go once in a while show that you

598
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,570
actually give a crap about how software

599
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,350
is made and what their team actually

600
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,970
does and you've got to build some

601
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,750
sympathy for each other for the goals

602
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,299
that you have

603
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,860
because by vpa one of my first companies

604
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,120
every time there would be some

605
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,229
contention in the room we'd start

606
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,000
arguing and things would get a little

607
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,130
heated so if I stop pull out a business

608
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,940
card

609
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,799
okay what does it say in that business

610
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,880
card oh look it's all the same company

611
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,730
guess what we're all on the same team

612
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,929
here okay because we're gold differently

613
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,490
does not mean at the end of the day that

614
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,590
doesn't feed up to something that is a

615
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,260
goal for the company to make money or

616
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:53,879
whatever it may be there is some common

617
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,370
goal that we're all working for all

618
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,850
right so this is the big one this is the

619
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,770
most important thing in any application

620
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,959
security program I would argue in any

621
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,910
kind of program anything Tim you want to

622
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,040
get someone to do something so I will

623
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,320
disagree with my former speaker here

624
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,480
about making them accountable you want

625
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,799
them to want to be accountable you want

626
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,639
them to take accountability

627
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,619
voluntarily right I am responsible for

628
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,658
the software that I write that doesn't

629
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,759
just mean functional aspects that means

630
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:28,009
non functional aspects I'm responsible

631
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,859
for the outcome of its insecure it's on

632
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:33,409
me I need to fix it usually it's a

633
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,699
security team problem they have to go

634
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,289
figure this problem out it's not my

635
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,059
problem they're putting compensating

636
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,369
controls in tuning glass and all the

637
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,539
other crap which doesn't fix the heart

638
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:43,609
of the problem that I keep making the

639
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,470
problem worse I think the problem

640
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,119
doesn't tend to get better that way so

641
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,779
we need to have that accountability it

642
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:53,299
has to be shared so we have to find some

643
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:56,419
alignment in our goals that means the

644
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:58,908
seaso needs to work with the CIO and say

645
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:01,580
you know what security is important for

646
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:03,950
development so me as CIO will say I'm

647
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,090
willing to be measured on it it guess

648
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,129
what that means for all the people that

649
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,539
work for they're gonna start to get

650
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:12,289
measured on it we're gonna start to do

651
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:14,330
reporting on it easy to say hey Bob why

652
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,220
is Lisa's team doing a much better job

653
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,989
on security than yours you better go

654
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,369
look into that and it starts to filter

655
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:21,169
down the organization it starts to

656
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:25,459
create the right outcomes and the right

657
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:27,289
behaviors has to be in their goals they

658
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,029
have to be part of what they get

659
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,940
measured on at the end of the year you

660
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:33,019
will not give me effort out of them

661
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,779
they're gonna work towards their bonus

662
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,269
they're gonna work towards their salary

663
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:41,019
and again measured and reported agree on

664
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:43,789
metrics or agreed on reporting

665
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:45,769
transparently not some you know hidden

666
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,658
document that only goes to the CIO or

667
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:49,519
only goes to the development leaders it

668
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:51,019
starts with the application team their

669
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,629
management they're made all the way up

670
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:55,879
to the CIO who reports then to the CEO

671
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:57,168
and then the seaso and the CIO are

672
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:59,719
sitting in the same room reporting to

673
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:07,369
the CEO saying here's how we're doing on

674
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:08,779
security as a team all right we have

675
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:11,359
this thing at Varick old called the

676
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:13,129
state of software security we have a

677
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,099
software as a service which means we

678
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:17,859
have access to lots of data we take a

679
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:22,009
look at that data and try to find

680
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:24,408
correlations between what we do and the

681
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:25,970
outcomes that we see so first and

682
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:27,680
foremost is training as I said before

683
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,710
developers were never

684
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,110
and to do software security we have to

685
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,210
teach them one of the ways that we can

686
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,750
teach them is on-demand learning you

687
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,610
learning right we have measured

688
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,170
companies that have eLearning versus

689
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,240
companies that don't need six times

690
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,130
difference that is huge

691
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,640
six times difference in how fast they're

692
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:52,190
able to remediate their stuff if they

693
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,230
have access to this now we can do this

694
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,820
also through instructor-led so my

695
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,310
favorite saying is I'm gonna fill a room

696
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,860
with pizzas and then the developers come

697
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,270
because developers love free food and

698
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,790
I'm gonna get to talk to him over there

699
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,800
lunch for an hour so what am I going to

700
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,750
talk to them about well what if we used

701
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,220
the scanning tools that we have to

702
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,170
create some kind of heat map and some

703
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,560
kind of thing that says hey you know

704
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,900
what sequel injection again is our

705
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,730
highest problem people keep creating

706
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,050
them so when I have the pizzas and the

707
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,150
developers in the same room I'm gonna

708
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,220
talk to them just about sequel injection

709
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,500
not about you know how to do secure

710
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,570
coding it's like who cares that stuff is

711
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,100
important but not critical let's talk

712
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,340
about something that they're doing today

713
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,590
that's hurting the business now as a

714
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,050
byproduct of that I can take that and

715
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,090
now measure the effectiveness because if

716
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,040
I'm if I'm doing my measurements

717
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,590
regularly of my application security I

718
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,990
should see sequel injection start to go

719
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,730
down because I've trained them how to do

720
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,770
it either that or I find out that I've

721
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,840
not a very good trainer I need to find

722
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,510
some other way but I can measure the

723
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,250
effectiveness of that now if you do that

724
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,050
if something that matters to them you

725
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,050
will get their attention and if you feed

726
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,490
them they will come alright so for all

727
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,649
of you in the room who's read the

728
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,140
Phoenix project all right a couple of

729
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,610
hands that's the first thing if you're

730
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,230
gonna start learning about DevOps read

731
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:15,439
that it's an easy read it's a novel it's

732
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:17,750
a story that kind of goes through this

733
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,020
fictitious company and the problems that

734
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:23,420
they had you can read it in a weekend if

735
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,500
you wanted to the DevOps handbook

736
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,440
actually has security

737
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:33,280
that's pretty cool first time you see

738
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,640
that this has chapter on chapter about

739
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,080
different aspects case studies on what

740
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,510
the effectiveness of DevOps can be

741
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,799
inside of your environment it is a good

742
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,960
read you this is not something you have

743
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,280
to read cover to cover I have you don't

744
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,539
have to read it from front to back if

745
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,649
you jump around inside the chapter so

746
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,230
you guys could start with the Security

747
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:54,159
chapter if you wanted to all right so

748
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:58,299
next we have to help them fix what they

749
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,220
find so if I say you have an XSS and

750
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:03,010
they said huh the other sequel injection

751
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,419
what the hell is that they don't

752
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,520
understand because they weren't trained

753
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,039
so oftentimes this is portrayed as we

754
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,570
think they're stupid look they're stupid

755
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,559
they just haven't been taught about this

756
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,530
stuff there's lots of things that we

757
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,730
don't know about their world as well I

758
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,190
can fortunately get to bridge both

759
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,480
worlds but we need to be there to help

760
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,950
them fix it I'm going to talk to you a

761
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,230
little bit about how we can scale that

762
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,230
kind of a program but we need to provide

763
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,330
them something whether it's us ourselves

764
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,760
some outsource agency that provides that

765
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,949
kind of service but what we don't want

766
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,539
is them wrapping around and doing Google

767
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,340
searches and maybe finding something

768
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,650
that's good maybe not finding something

769
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,299
that's good and what we've measured that

770
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,789
we have a consulting service that does

771
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:44,799
this it's called a readout call where we

772
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:46,090
walk them through this a this person

773
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,158
who's called an application security

774
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,330
consultant they are experts in security

775
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,070
and experts in the language that that

776
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,320
application was written in they speak

777
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,908
developer so they can walk through those

778
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,039
vulnerabilities help them understand why

779
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:58,360
that is actually a thing because usually

780
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,610
what you get back is that it's a false

781
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,408
positive that can never happen so we

782
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,449
help they explain to them why that is a

783
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:06,610
thing and why and how you would fix it

784
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,140
so we see a two and a half times

785
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,709
improvement and how fast they're able to

786
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,830
fix these things

787
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,679
all right so how do we scale typically

788
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,870
100 to one are worse for developers to

789
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,370
security people or at least application

790
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,570
security people or if you got a security

791
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:27,939
person it's like this much of their job

792
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:31,899
so this comes up a lot in InfoSec

793
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,909
conferences these days and this is about

794
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,669
extending your reach about creating a

795
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,289
force multiplier right creating the eyes

796
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,580
and ears inside of those teams so as we

797
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,049
talk about having

798
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,799
let's see it's some of our largest

799
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:46,590
customers five eight thousand

800
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,330
applications oh my god that's

801
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:54,399
mind-bending in teams

802
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:56,379
hundreds of application teams how do you

803
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,580
possibly go to all of those Sarah boys

804
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:58,779
how do you go to all those grooming

805
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,908
sessions to make sure that they're

806
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:03,429
talking about secured you cannot it is

807
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:06,249
physically impossible we just talked

808
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:07,570
about the gap in cybersecurity Todd you

809
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:10,960
can't even hire enough people if you

810
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:13,299
wanted to you have to build it into the

811
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,830
people that are already on the team so

812
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:17,168
what we have done and what we've seen

813
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:21,249
other companies do is we get volunteers

814
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,869
from each team voluntold is okay well we

815
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:24,609
get volunteers at least one you'd like

816
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:26,980
at least one two would be great because

817
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:28,889
I don't like bus factors of one as an

818
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,450
engineering former engineering manager

819
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:33,279
and they get some specialized training

820
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,019
now you sell this to people by saying

821
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,480
hey look we don't have to go hire people

822
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,269
we can't hire we're using resources we

823
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,340
already have and to sell it to the

824
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:44,139
developers you say you are now more

825
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,609
important not only to this company but

826
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:48,668
in your next job if you can put down

827
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:50,379
cybersecurity expert or application

828
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:55,799
security specialist or something like

829
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:57,459
that you are now more employable win-win

830
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,480
so we're gonna give them some

831
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,820
specialized training and talk to them

832
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,289
about CIA I talked to about threat

833
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,639
modeling we're gonna give them some

834
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,289
grooming guidelines now these usually

835
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:07,119
appear in the form of some simple

836
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,609
checklist so we're gonna start simple

837
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,899
and build on that so the longer they're

838
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:13,418
in the program the more training they

839
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:15,789
get the more they understand so we're

840
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:18,309
gonna give them some guidelines for

841
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:19,869
instance if this touches crypto or this

842
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,649
touches authentication or authorization

843
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:26,109
pen test write some simple stuff other

844
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:27,820
things will use the automated tools

845
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:31,168
because they can find it better faster

846
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,918
cheaper earlier than we ever could

847
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,869
we're going to teach them how to do

848
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,269
secure code reviews not for everything

849
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,850
but some certain easy things for them to

850
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:41,499
go and spot so that way when they're in

851
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,840
their grooming sessions they say hey you

852
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:45,940
know what I see you're writing sequel in

853
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,490
that I want to do make sure that we do a

854
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,080
secure coding assessment of that before

855
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,040
you were allowed to merge that so it

856
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
becomes one of the things

857
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,330
and their definition of done so actually

858
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,610
that's an important thing part of what

859
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,379
happens in an agile team which again

860
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,629
migrates the DevOps because it we run it

861
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,120
on agile is the concept of definition of

862
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,150
done so if I have to build something I

863
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,530
have a story says build this clicker

864
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,000
there's a checklist that I have to go

865
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,680
through to say did I do all of these

866
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,480
things that I test it for functionality

867
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,140
did I add new unit tests did I do

868
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,240
security testing on it that becomes part

869
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,090
of what they are expected to do before

870
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,310
they can say it's finished and ready to

871
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,080
go to a customer so we add that in there

872
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:29,129
so we can add that in our grooming

873
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,020
sessions through these security people

874
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:34,030
basic security controls and guess what

875
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,270
we get to do some fun stuff with them so

876
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:40,000
we'll get together on a weekday at lunch

877
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,670
one brings their laptops let's do a CTF

878
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,050
how fun is that developers actually like

879
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,330
doing that stuff and understanding the

880
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,470
other side so if I'm going to be the guy

881
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,649
that's attacking maybe I think

882
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,450
differently about defending in critical

883
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,490
part here is they need to know their

884
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,280
limits they are not infinitely powerful

885
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,630
I have a longer form talk on on building

886
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,190
security champions programs if you're

887
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,380
interested to talk to me

888
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,020
but there's a there's a point at which

889
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:08,700
they say ah I'm over my skis please

890
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,699
security expert come in and helped me

891
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:16,750
all right holistically now we have to

892
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:18,819
fill this gap with tools if we are

893
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,219
running at a pace of multiple releases a

894
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,970
day you need something to catch the easy

895
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,668
stuff

896
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,949
I don't want to pay a pen tester to go

897
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:28,199
find my sequel injection oh my god why

898
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,609
the hell would I do that

899
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,980
those people are far too valuable and

900
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,500
can find really cool things and

901
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,300
hard-to-find things I do not want them

902
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,949
finding my sequel injections would you

903
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:45,010
agree is it do you enjoy that yeah but

904
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,389
that's the easy part of the job right so

905
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,610
what we're gonna do is we're gonna start

906
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,109
doing static analysis the second they

907
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:54,400
start writing code day one in their IDE

908
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,690
watching the mess a code and pointing

909
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,910
out the things that they're doing wrong

910
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,760
we're also gonna start looking at open

911
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,879
source risk so we talked a lot about

912
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,070
that today

913
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,960
I want to know what they have in their

914
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,550
software I need to create a software

915
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,340
Bill of Materials before I go to

916
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,340
production because and we'll go back to

917
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,810
the my security champion the other thing

918
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,110
that they are responsible for is that

919
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:21,590
part of my incident response team so CVE

920
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:23,920
thus and such gets created we get

921
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,570
together and say are we vulnerable I

922
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,980
don't have to do that work security

923
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,500
champions please report back to me by

924
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,200
the end of today on if you use this

925
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,280
library and if you do what you're gonna

926
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,640
do about it and when you gonna have it

927
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,870
patched darn they're part of their job

928
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,730
is to be part of that instrument or

929
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,589
sports team you can't do it as one

930
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,420
person that I would argue that if

931
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,110
Equifax had this they would have been

932
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,400
patching long before they were exploit

933
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:52,490
if you don't know what you're shipping

934
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,740
you are screwed because like I said it's

935
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,479
easy to understand if I have struts hard

936
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,259
to understand if I've got some

937
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,500
particular version of Apache Commons

938
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:06,290
which ends up if you look at it in over

939
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:08,630
80,000 libraries inside of the

940
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,070
frameworks it gets pulled in everywhere

941
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,230
which means it's in millions of

942
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,350
applications you've all probably but how

943
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,900
would your not so I'm looking for that

944
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,630
from the very early stages of coding now

945
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,270
as soon as I have something that can run

946
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:25,910
again to save on costs and and to make

947
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:28,820
myself run faster I'm going to use

948
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,529
dynamic analysis which is chief

949
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,380
automated pen test it can't do what a

950
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,390
pen tester can do it can't but that's

951
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,010
okay you can find things like hey it

952
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,450
misconfigured data you didn't do this or

953
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:41,090
you're leaking that information that's

954
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:44,540
the super easy to find you can find it

955
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,430
quickly and cheaply if I'm gonna pay a

956
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,220
pen tester I want them to find the hard

957
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,230
stuff so let's find that with dynamic

958
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,430
analysis and by the way we go all the

959
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,270
way into production with dynamic

960
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:58,100
analysis why because typically

961
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,680
especially if we're running old-school

962
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,569
on our own hardware we've got a quality

963
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,700
lab and we have a staging lab and then

964
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,950
we have our production environment are

965
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,169
those maintained by the same people do I

966
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,520
get patch management on my QA systems I

967
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,830
doubt it

968
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,900
do i configure everything the same well

969
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,420
maybe at first but when a problem

970
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,980
happens in production they op the ops

971
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,390
guy goes in he makes a configuration

972
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,650
change do you think it comes back and

973
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,900
make sure that QA has changed and

974
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,050
stagings changed doubt it

975
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:30,180
who has time its until you get to that

976
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,560
infrastructure is code where if you

977
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,390
touch it you got to change it in the

978
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,590
code you cannot change it on the machine

979
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,140
because it will just be overwritten

980
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:38,460
that's the place that we're going to but

981
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,720
until we get there we need to start

982
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,740
looking for this stuff because the

983
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,049
configuration just diverges and then we

984
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:49,259
have this thing called rasp anyone heard

985
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,850
of rasp right so this is a smart agent

986
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,340
that sits inside of the the running

987
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,440
application and watches things happen so

988
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,180
it can find easy stuff like sequel

989
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,010
injection or cross-site scripting now

990
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,230
let's say that my application security

991
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,030
program is just starting out I could

992
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,410
protect myself while I go back and fix

993
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,780
them I don't want to leave them that way

994
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,190
forever but it's a mitigating control if

995
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,020
something can protect me a little bit

996
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,580
and then if I miss something maybe it's

997
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,840
the air bag that saves the application

998
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,850
okay

999
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,050
security team big important job was

1000
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:20,610
starting all the way over here modeling

1001
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,290
security grooming talking about secure

1002
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,850
design helping those teams in the very

1003
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,370
early stages before they make the

1004
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:28,290
mistake because after they make it after

1005
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,089
I've knit the whole damn sweater and I

1006
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,340
got to come back up to here because I

1007
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,660
dropped a stitch I got unknit the whole

1008
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,550
thing and then reknit it that is

1009
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:42,120
incredibly expensive so our CTO his dad

1010
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,760
used to work for GE jet engines build

1011
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,560
jet engines right when do you think the

1012
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,520
right time is to figure out that a fan

1013
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,740
blade is is gonna break is it when it's

1014
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,140
in the test stand and I rev it up and

1015
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,839
the thing comes apart and shatters and

1016
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,160
loses millions of dollars well what if I

1017
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,120
could have X rated when it was coming in

1018
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,879
the door and I make sure that that

1019
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,589
faulty part never makes it in DevOps is

1020
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,660
all about testing as early as possible

1021
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,030
to find these mistakes and fail fast so

1022
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,129
that way that stuff doesn't happen or at

1023
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,600
least it's very unlikely and if it does

1024
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,820
that I'm going to add a new test and

1025
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,400
that new test will hopefully save me the

1026
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,470
next time so we're there to help them

1027
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,630
big important part in the middle here

1028
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,310
and it's big on purpose we've got to

1029
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,660
help them fix what they find if we have

1030
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,200
an application security program that

1031
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,759
only does

1032
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,649
scanning and identifies vulnerabilities

1033
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,670
and that's what our job is to is to just

1034
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,520
get the list

1035
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:34,740
who cares what are we there for we've

1036
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,020
got to reduce the risk at the end we

1037
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,819
could do our red teaming and our pen

1038
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,579
testing that stuff is all still valuable

1039
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,930
and can lead us feedback loops back to

1040
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,930
the development teams to make them

1041
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,299
better so if I have red blue team I can

1042
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,339
say here's threats that we see or here's

1043
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,320
threats that we've figured out we can

1044
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,970
add that nor threat models we can make

1045
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,630
our development teams better over time

1046
00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:02,640
all right so right size testing anyone

1047
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:06,060
heard the term CI CD pipeline the

1048
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,759
straight man alright so this is an

1049
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,190
actual pipeline for a micro service from

1050
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,750
a dev ops team that I built and my

1051
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,810
instructions were that for them were

1052
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,700
when this gets checked in I want this to

1053
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,220
be a completely lights-out deploy it was

1054
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,779
a greenfield project we're starting from

1055
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,078
scratch let's build it right the first

1056
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,660
time

1057
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,040
I want to build tests that I trust and

1058
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,230
those will take me all the way to

1059
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,109
production so here's my backlog like we

1060
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,190
talked about my developer comes in now

1061
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:33,839
we're gonna do our standard building

1062
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,950
tests which they do now because they

1063
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,140
were agile analysis take the test before

1064
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:43,529
you take the test it's no different than

1065
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,848
taking your cissp or your CSS LP right

1066
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,990
you take all the practice tests you can

1067
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:47,190
because by the time you get into the

1068
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,200
test you're gonna you're gonna blow

1069
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:51,480
right through it right they need to know

1070
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,589
that when they scan something it says

1071
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,510
it's clean then it's gonna be clean

1072
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:56,279
later because we're in a retest right

1073
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:58,680
that's what our assurance testing is for

1074
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,810
but let's take care of the problems here

1075
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,828
and by the way when they start doing

1076
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,430
this they're gonna start to educate

1077
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:06,630
themselves so eventually I've proven

1078
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,879
this because I have developers are

1079
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,069
boring for me into 10 years it comes out

1080
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,329
of here secure isn't that the best world

1081
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,800
that we could be in where they actually

1082
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:15,630
write it securely the first time I don't

1083
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,130
have to find it I don't have to track it

1084
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,410
and I have to chase them and beg them

1085
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:23,069
for for a budget they just don't do it

1086
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:27,328
again that's before check it now quick

1087
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:30,839
pause good manual testing pen testing is

1088
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:32,550
important I believe in it but I only

1089
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,940
believe in it for certain categories of

1090
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,940
stuff

1091
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:41,480
only in cash but in manpower and in

1092
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,710
calendar time DevOps if you're leasing

1093
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,339
twice a day and you start measuring

1094
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:48,289
testing calendars those things don't

1095
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,240
work together so we're gonna pull those

1096
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,279
things aside before we do the final

1097
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,140
check-in so this is release candidate

1098
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:56,450
when he gets in there I'm done with it

1099
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,730
if you'd identify your grooming session

1100
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,129
that has to pentesting fine put in an

1101
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,650
environment say hey pen tester go at it

1102
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:06,710
I don't care how long it takes it will

1103
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,240
wait I'll do other things now he goes

1104
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,309
and does the pen test come back to me or

1105
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,220
similar results we worked through them I

1106
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:15,829
fixed them we're both satisfied now I

1107
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,269
check-in don't put people in the rest of

1108
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:20,809
this process what I'm about to show you

1109
00:42:17,269 --> 00:42:22,279
no people should be should play here all

1110
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:24,559
right so now on every check-in because

1111
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:27,890
this is very small low surface area

1112
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:29,420
micro-service my CI server is going to

1113
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,589
come up we're gonna build and we're

1114
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,289
gonna run some tests though this is this

1115
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:36,130
typical static analysis stuff of lint

1116
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:39,500
plus code complex the plus code coverage

1117
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:41,779
unit tests I'm gonna introduce static

1118
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,460
analysis in here because that's my

1119
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:46,609
insurance test did they follow the

1120
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,920
procedure or not and I get my result of

1121
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:51,019
this is the CI portion the continuous

1122
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,690
integration portion of this pipeline

1123
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:55,640
it's like sniff test stuff I could do

1124
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,809
without the code actually running it

1125
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,029
doesn't even have to be functionally

1126
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:01,309
complete I can run some tests to say

1127
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:03,500
whether you're doing well or not if

1128
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:06,019
they're not and I choose to I can break

1129
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:13,579
the build and synchronize the backlog

1130
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:15,649
another key step here and you give them

1131
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:17,990
spreadsheets and you give them PDFs and

1132
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,190
you say go to this other management

1133
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,538
system that has all security

1134
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,059
vulnerabilities your stuff will never

1135
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:25,220
make it to the top it has to appear as a

1136
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:28,400
bug in their backlog for them to do work

1137
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:30,049
when I was in charge of a scrum team and

1138
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,730
someone says hey are you doing this and

1139
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:33,769
like well tell me what the number is in

1140
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,990
JIRA if it's not in JIRA it's not

1141
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:37,368
getting done I promise you that if I

1142
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,089
don't have a work item for it it's not

1143
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,730
going to happen

1144
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:42,170
all right let's presume developers did a

1145
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,849
great job they followed all the right

1146
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,880
process now we're going to go into

1147
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:48,280
operational environments we're going to

1148
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,810
with our multi-tier @qa the staging may

1149
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,280
be UAT and then our production

1150
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,330
environment I'm gonna run more testing

1151
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,460
on it so I'll run some automated

1152
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:57,160
regression testing I'm also gonna run

1153
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,960
dynamic analysis against it in certain

1154
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,120
places this works very well so this

1155
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,890
happens to be a single page application

1156
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,430
written in angular very low surface area

1157
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,960
runs very quickly in other places that

1158
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,210
might not be the case maybe you need to

1159
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,860
do some more pointed scripting against

1160
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,870
your dynamic analysis to make sure that

1161
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,270
that works again I'm going to get that

1162
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,009
pass/fail we move on to the next stage

1163
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,230
or we break and we move all the way back

1164
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,090
so this is the CVE

1165
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:25,780
continuous deployment or continuous

1166
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,860
delivery portion of this sometimes this

1167
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,200
can go all the way through to production

1168
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,090
in this case it does I trust these tests

1169
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,740
and it just goes there are other places

1170
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,680
where you have your cab or you have

1171
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,970
other places that you need to go for

1172
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,100
approvals and there's button pushing and

1173
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:42,700
stuff that can still happen but automate

1174
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:46,660
as much as possible all right so

1175
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,279
wrapping up in conclusion you got to

1176
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,740
learn this stuff if your company's going

1177
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,150
to DevOps and you don't understand it no

1178
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,689
one's going to talk to you you have to

1179
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,610
be able to speak developer okay get into

1180
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,020
their world and be able to go to them

1181
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,610
and talk to them about their ceremonies

1182
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:03,100
talk to them about creating a security

1183
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:06,430
champions program build the

1184
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,960
relationships that you need and you need

1185
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,060
to work at the very highest levels in

1186
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,220
the very lowest levels you can't cold

1187
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,350
call in to an individual contributor so

1188
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,850
I need you to fix this you need the

1189
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,290
highest levels of your company to agree

1190
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,779
that this is a problem that we are going

1191
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,350
to address is a top concern for the

1192
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,480
company

1193
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,970
these are boardroom discussions today

1194
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:30,180
you don't think Equifax we lost the CEO

1195
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:32,169
the CIO and the C so all within a week

1196
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,520
you don't think the board's talking

1197
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,200
about these you don't think the C Suites

1198
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,950
talking about this get it on their

1199
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,430
roadmap it's a great opportunity and get

1200
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:43,899
it part of the yearly goals you have to

1201
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,980
train them they're not trained but you

1202
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,620
can't throw them out because who you

1203
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,420
gonna hire even the newest college

1204
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,940
graduates might have this much I was

1205
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,920
talking to someone yesterday

1206
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,940
she just graduated from college I said

1207
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,080
did you get any security training she

1208
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,030
goes yeah I get some Network training

1209
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,520
network security it's like well it

1210
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,410
doesn't help me for a sec

1211
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,770
they're not trained on it you'd have to

1212
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,720
do it and you have to adjust to the

1213
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,700
speed of DevOps so you can still do your

1214
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,500
pen testing I'm not here to say you

1215
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,960
can't I'm here to say it is important

1216
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,910
let's do it at the right time and for

1217
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,980
the right things let's flush out all the

1218
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,690
easy crap that we can find through other

1219
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,290
means and automated tools that are very

1220
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,790
low cost and very quick and flush those

1221
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,670
out first so that way I'm not paying

1222
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:29,220
this guy crap a little money to go find

1223
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,720
a sequel injection it's not very

1224
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,368
interesting to him now he makes money on

1225
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,529
it but I'm sure you'd rather go crack

1226
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,700
some hard problems say ah you guys think

1227
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:40,860
you got this done let me figure this out

1228
00:46:37,700 --> 00:47:02,819
all right that is it I'm happy to take

1229
00:46:40,860 --> 00:47:04,230
questions yes sir so I don't think this

1230
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,760
looks any different for any kind of

1231
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:09,180
software whether it's shrink-wrapped or

1232
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,670
not right you still want like I said

1233
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,649
this is a terminology that we use in the

1234
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,450
industry is called shifting left I'm

1235
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:21,660
sure you guys have heard it right it's

1236
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:24,660
shifting it's only in the last year or

1237
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,089
two that these tools have become high

1238
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,319
enough speed and high enough quality in

1239
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,850
other words false positive false

1240
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,680
negative rates for us to be able to

1241
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,299
stick it into the development team give

1242
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,160
it to them raw and then they can

1243
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,630
actually do something with it so this is

1244
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,589
about finding those things early so

1245
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,060
there are other things that you would

1246
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,200
including here depending on your release

1247
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,720
model and depending on where you were

1248
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,759
going we run a SAS business this is how

1249
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:49,819
we do it

1250
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,820
any other questions yes sir

1251
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,319
all right so offshore development teams

1252
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,839
it's critical that you get this as part

1253
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,910
of the contract so if I'm gonna hire

1254
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,070
this side of the room to go off and

1255
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,470
build me something I need to provide

1256
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:11,000
clarity on what exactly they're going to

1257
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,290
give me it's not some functional

1258
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,420
requirements it has to combine the

1259
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:16,130
non-functional and by the way if you

1260
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,990
already have a contract you might be

1261
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:20,839
able to squeeze it in as a quality issue

1262
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,209
because security equals quality a bug is

1263
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:25,490
a bug so you need to find a way to

1264
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,349
enable them now depending on where they

1265
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,118
are or how they work you're going to

1266
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:31,970
have a hard time with training because

1267
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,050
in some states you are not allowed to

1268
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:38,330
train them by law you cannot train them

1269
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,650
so you need their employers to do the

1270
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,569
training you need to build that another

1271
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,190
contract so I expect these outcomes

1272
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:44,630
they'll start to figure out that if they

1273
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,390
start to train them maybe they're gonna

1274
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,890
do it faster so if this is all about

1275
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,390
understanding what your requirements are

1276
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:53,029
providing that clarity in the contract

1277
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:54,170
the contract basis and then holding them

1278
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,430
accountable for it so it's no different

1279
00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:09,369
but there are usually some restrictions

1280
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:12,710
yes yes yes so we're talking about in

1281
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:16,420
this case we're working in an IDE in

1282
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:19,220
this case this plugs right into Jenkins

1283
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,300
backlog there are first-class plugins

1284
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,310
for lots of different systems so I

1285
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,040
though once I specify the ones that that

1286
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,750
we use but build systems ideas bug

1287
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,950
trackers there are integrations usually

1288
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,510
for most of the tools that you can go

1289
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,520
out there and look for I would make sure

1290
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,440
that they have those as part of the cost

1291
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,170
of doing business with you part of the

1292
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,880
critical criteria that you need but yes

1293
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,349
you and a lot of them are scriptable too

1294
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,300
so they have API so if you have some

1295
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:46,690
unique system that you built you can get

1296
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:46,690
an integration as well no yes

1297
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:57,109
very good question it's usually part of

1298
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,120
an item that you talk about so you have

1299
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,470
that security champion in the room when

1300
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,319
we bring up hey I want to add this

1301
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,669
checkbox or this workflow even though

1302
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,920
the application we're gonna say alright

1303
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,090
well let's talk about threats here what

1304
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,680
are we worried about how we're gonna

1305
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,000
secure it what are the security things

1306
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,810
that I need to make sure a gun is part

1307
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,610
of this task now again everything that

1308
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,990
the team does has to be work so let's

1309
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:20,300
say we're going to do its threat

1310
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:22,220
modeling exercise that actually becomes

1311
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,710
a story in the backlog that the team

1312
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,970
takes in because it takes real time and

1313
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:28,310
it becomes part of their sprint

1314
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,680
deliverable this month this week we are

1315
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:33,020
going to create a threat model or we're

1316
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,210
gonna review the threat model it's

1317
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,710
actual work it gets costed out like

1318
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:53,840
everything else and gets done like

1319
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:56,120
everything else nothing is free yes and

1320
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,580
even better to use actually writing the

1321
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,130
software so let's say I need cleansers

1322
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,290
who would need those so what if the

1323
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,540
security team actually put on the shoes

1324
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,340
of a developer and wrote some libraries

1325
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,870
that will go through and say this is the

1326
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,880
standardization function here's the

1327
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,279
output encoding function if you guys use

1328
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,200
this we will support it and we are

1329
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,120
responsible for the security of it so we

1330
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,129
can cut standardized in our companies

1331
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,779
how that's done and guess what you get

1332
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,660
to start learning that development isn't

1333
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:29,660
really as easy as you think it might be

1334
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:33,350
how we doing for time sorry okay anybody

1335
