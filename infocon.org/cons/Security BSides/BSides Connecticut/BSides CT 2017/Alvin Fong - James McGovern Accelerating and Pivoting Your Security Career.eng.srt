1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
let's get started with our next talk I

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,039
want to welcome elven Fung and James

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,830
McGovern over here from both I think are

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,110
running a wasp right now and let's

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,820
welcome them and listen to their talk

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:25,049
accelerating and pivoting from your

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:25,560
security career oh not from glad to be

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,439
here

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,460
Becca besides Connecticut a few years

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,680
here on honey pots and so a little bit

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,280
of a different topic James and I are

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,480
here to chat a little bit more about so

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,820
just start out with the general

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,459
disclaimer if you guys are easily

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:51,300
offended or have you know hey this may

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,039
not be to talk for you but with that

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:15,689
introduction James do you wanna

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:17,070
introduce yourself also practicing

19
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,979
Enterprise Architect

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,960
and the one thing I wanted to kind of

21
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,330
say about that is is that information

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,070
security people need to start shifting

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,220
some of the blame to the enterprise

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,470
architects in your organization right we

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,439
can make fun of the latest breach we all

26
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,259
know about struts right I'm not sure

27
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,070
that security people knew about that

28
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,360
particular outlaw mobility but I'm 100%

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,250
enterprise architects know about that

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,710
particular vulnerability

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:54,990
chose to do nothing about it so let's

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:57,419
try to figure out well I'm Alvin Fung

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,570
I'm a principal security architect at

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,670
lodestone security in the breaker

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,490
builder defender world of a wasp I

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,220
consider myself a breaker got my start

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,008
in the federal sector doing

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,109
vulnerability assessments and helping to

39
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,208
build out and do some research in the

40
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,360
security operation center moved over to

41
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,160
have a healthcare space for a bit where

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,640
I got sunk into the risk and compliance

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,870
side said bump that then we've no fur to

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,119
working at large enterprise organization

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,480
to help build up an app SEC team there

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,610
and now back out lodestone doing app SEC

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:48,238
and penetration test and ro ability

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:54,420
assessments battles lost 501c3 the goal

49
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:57,090
is to make software security many people

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,100
are not aware necessarily of how to make

51
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,799
informed decisions because a lot of

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,489
security is not visible to the naked eye

53
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:07,920
we have a challenge with their IDs

54
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:13,049
specifically with executives who have

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,390
attention deficit disorder and we come

56
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,980
across a lot of the I don't understand

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,958
and therefore it's not important right

58
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,670
and Olas is just one of the

59
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,829
organizations trying to help make

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,559
security visible especially as an

61
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,900
application

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,819
lair we're not-for-profit and do a lot

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,160
of things to make things open source

64
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,160
such that people can consume my work

65
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,260
alright so I've got a putting this talk

66
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,880
together you know there are a few things

67
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,519
we want to hit on for folks give a

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,209
little bit of a lay of the land for the

69
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,030
state of computer security employment

70
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:00,220
talk about kind of the pipeline problems

71
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,959
and potential solutions and then we kind

72
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,549
of shift over to visualizing some career

73
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,709
paths talk about some common paths

74
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,760
technical and non-technical skills in

75
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,200
those fields a little bit about good

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,630
industry type fits for those folks that

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,880
are maybe looking to explore different

78
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,608
industries in the secure profession and

79
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,779
then we take kind of this approach to it

80
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,810
where we look at some of the career

81
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,070
pipeline past present and future I mean

82
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,410
hopefully we'll leave you guys with some

83
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,820
of the learning resources and talk a

84
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,620
little bit about the mentorship back

85
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,570
initiative we would love to kick off

86
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,770
here in the Connecticut area so you know

87
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,229
like I said I think there's a little bit

88
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,109
of everything for different folks in the

89
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,510
room you know I'm not gonna read through

90
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,520
everything here but you know we have

91
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,159
some kind of hopefully things folks will

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,130
take away whether they're in a hiring

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,889
manager capacity or a manager that's in

94
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,260
a hiring capacity and if you are in that

95
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,880
role you know the distinction you know

96
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,380
some tidbits for recruiters and HR areas

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,950
academic institutions that are looking

98
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,570
to develop and enhance some of their

99
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,760
curriculums and obviously for folks in

100
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,950
the room for neo and also experienced

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,570
professionals all right so jeans you

102
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,180
want to talk a little bit about the

103
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,180
state of cyber computer security

104
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,610
that we started with a few quotes which

105
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,710
will help set the context of what we are

106
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,289
looking at in terms of computer security

107
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,830
going forward so the first quote is just

108
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,719
33 percent of Millennials use secure

109
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,840
passwords for all of their company their

110
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:45,069
accounts compared to 53 percent of baby

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,948
boomers right so what does this signal

112
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:50,590
to us right we think about II's and

113
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,650
passwords a lot right and we worry about

114
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,929
whether their cache using sha-1 or md5

115
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,479
or whatever but we never really think

116
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,020
about eliminating passwords and their

117
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,710
entire when we think about

118
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,210
specifications such as the sample

119
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,289
specification that specification for

120
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:14,650
single sign-on has been in existence for

121
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:15,810
15 years but we are still doing IDs and

122
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,000
passwords

123
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,789
that's a marketplace reality breaches

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,229
are becoming commonplace 32% of the

125
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,818
companies say they were victims of cyber

126
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,990
crime in 2016 we're not necessarily

127
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,779
approving we're not staying up to date

128
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,120
right because we might be a breaker but

129
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:36,039
not understanding building we're not

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,229
necessarily working on that in terms of

131
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,349
an ecosystem where we're procuring

132
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:44,139
secure software we'd allow people to

133
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:47,199
come into our organizations called

134
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,479
outsourcing and allow them to put in all

135
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,189
sorts of testing backdoors right you got

136
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,740
a problem here we got to look at this

137
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:57,129
through a couple different lenses

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,469
another quote 87% of CIOs believe their

139
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:03,069
security controls are failing to protect

140
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,780
their business right surprise the

141
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,240
numbers not

142
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,729
but we can talk about that a little bit

143
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,290
later the creek question that we have to

144
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,850
ask ourselves what are we doing to build

145
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,460
we are really good about forgetting out

146
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,860
how to play with technology right but if

147
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,680
people don't fundamentally trust that we

148
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,550
are competent to secure the enterprise

149
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,550
are we really a profession the human

150
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,330
attack surface to reach 4 billion people

151
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,190
by 2020 okay very simple Microsoft

152
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,979
estimating set by 2020 four billion

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,990
people will be online twice the number

154
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,000
that are on the line now the hackers

155
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,100
smell blood now not so loud

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,630
right so we're gonna have a big problem

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,419
not necessarily worried about cross-site

158
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,760
scripting sequel injection firewalls SSO

159
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,770
under 20 bit cushion shot want those

160
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,820
types of things right we're gonna have a

161
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,849
major social engineering problem coming

162
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,860
up how many people need to think in

163
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,530
terms of local area and universities

164
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:13,040
teach social engineering right you think

165
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,659
you got a problem here right just BCC

166
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,880
marketplace realities that we are not as

167
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,169
professionals dealing with next let's

168
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,490
look at this this is an interesting

169
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,380
slide that I came across it's an

170
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,740
economic slide it came from Berkeley

171
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:35,700
right and it's about an in a survey the

172
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,680
victims of various regions right we try

173
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,340
to get the 31 percent of people are

174
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:46,989
making you know changes

175
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:48,580
security plan look at that 52% what does

176
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,040
that what does that signal to us right

177
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,990
maybe that particular change might be

178
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,530
due to something that happened right we

179
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,530
are as a profession making ourselves too

180
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,270
expensive we've seen what happened to

181
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:11,380
COBOL programmers throughout your lives

182
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:14,020
or anything we're building up more and

183
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,780
more security people right only to watch

184
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,030
us be deflated we have to deal with this

185
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:28,150
particular problem aligned with the

186
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:30,579
marketplace reality so just to get

187
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,760
everyone on the same page about security

188
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,080
jobs so according to cyber seek this was

189
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,790
a project that was funded by the

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,920
National Institute of Standards and

191
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,920
Technology so according to them there's

192
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,079
almost 300,000 computer security job

193
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,540
openings across the country and about

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,490
3/4 million folks employed as security

195
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,260
professionals so the neat thing kind of

196
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,540
that I thought about this visual is so

197
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,890
when you click down on Connecticut you

198
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,230
know you can kind of drill down on some

199
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,270
of the state-by-state details and I

200
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,560
think Connecticut's pretty reflective of

201
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,579
what we're seeing at the national level

202
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,130
you know and you know we're kind of

203
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,570
going down that kind of peak on the the

204
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,330
security side in terms of you know the

205
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,430
demand is so high nowadays you know

206
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,140
there's a study here by dice calm where

207
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,969
lead software security engineers or

208
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,510
actually seeking some higher average

209
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,640
salaries that assists us so it's

210
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,560
interesting to kind of see the variation

211
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,680
here of the different security

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,630
professions you know with a saps a core

213
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,290
computer security or you know those type

214
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,290
of leadership roles

215
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:38,939
so how do we meet that demand right and

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,540
so you listen to the National Center of

217
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,410
Education Statistics they talk about how

218
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,599
you know there's only about a hundred

219
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,630
and seventy thousand stem graduates that

220
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,260
come out of you know Cal you know

221
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:55,350
college degrees and get jobs in the stem

222
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,910
area from the over four million high

223
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,660
school students that kind of enter this

224
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:08,339
pipeline if we look at these particular

225
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:16,829
drugs or we allowing at this particular

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:19,080
level arts our our superintendents where

227
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,700
people go to school to become art majors

228
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,250
and ultimately end up working at

229
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,770
Starbucks when instead they should be

230
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,260
following the pipeline in current and

231
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,360
adding value to a society in a way that

232
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,220
allows your kids to make the money that

233
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,270
we were talking about on future slides

234
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,420
of prior slides many security

235
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,240
professionals understand the growth of

236
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,910
security within their organization and

237
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,910
within the ecosystem at large but as

238
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,640
parents are we bringing our kids to the

239
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,410
events like these so if there's any moms

240
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,720
or dads in the room that left their kids

241
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,500
at home and they could have came here

242
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,870
shame on you

243
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,340
another trip right so in other words

244
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,740
when we think about this particular

245
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,830
thing we have to figure out what the

246
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,130
aptitude is that's going to call out the

247
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:10,650
people who make good security give you

248
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,840
an example just to kind of close this up

249
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,180
right you probably hear a lot of people

250
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,740
talking about school climate let's all

251
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,779
play nice

252
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,000
imagine if we found the way for people

253
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:24,399
to not play nice in the sandbox and we

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,260
can leverage them to solve those social

255
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,700
engineering challenges that we know are

256
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,819
going to come up because we got

257
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,370
forbidden to keep depending on law right

258
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,890
we're allowing our school systems

259
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:40,209
through various types of policies to

260
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:43,110
destroy our ability to be secure think

261
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,109
about that for a minute

262
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,380
so kind of you know as James kind of

263
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,960
mentioned when we look at Millennials

264
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,340
overall you know this was a study done

265
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,890
by Raytheon back in 2013 over 80% of the

266
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,990
students there said they had no teacher

267
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,939
or guidance counselor mention anything

268
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,779
about a potential career in

269
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,970
cybersecurity

270
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:13,120
that's actually one of the things as we

271
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,950
had got a chance to interview folks to

272
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,089
develop this presentation found out that

273
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,240
you know folks weren't even know where

274
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:23,410
you could get paid to do to hack into

275
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,020
stuff from the security side so you know

276
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,420
that same population that was surveyed

277
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:33,300
only a quarter expressed a desire to

278
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,300
pursue a computer science related field

279
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:57,790
here's the interesting las vegas at in

280
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:02,260
the elected official of the understood

281
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,390
Bob's presentation on threat bomb and we

282
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,740
could have made something secure or we

283
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,900
thought about this in terms of

284
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,270
Connecticut how many people do you think

285
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,920
in Connecticut understand threat

286
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,020
modeling or either come from an IT

287
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,670
background that are elected right how

288
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,819
many state centers how many state reps

289
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,829
zero right so how do you think if we're

290
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,860
going to an ecosystem that's based on

291
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:26,410
i.t we got 18 percent of being elected

292
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,709
and we've never communicated anything to

293
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,170
them that makes any level of sense right

294
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:34,569
this is why we have problems with voting

295
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,120
right we can't even secure our voting

296
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,190
systems right which is an issue that's

297
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,350
bipartisan by Hawaii and so it's not

298
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,970
about being democrat or republican yes

299
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:46,360
they argue it through different lenses

300
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,160
right but fundamentally has anyone ever

301
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,260
elected official the person in the state

302
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,500
of Connecticut that's responsible for

303
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:58,120
buying certifying voting machines a

304
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,220
threat model right you got some things

305
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,529
that we have to connect up here right so

306
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,450
let's try to figure out how to kind of

307
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,339
not only think about it in terms of

308
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,470
current state but to figure out how we

309
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,910
can help our children Millennials right

310
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,890
so that when we're leaving this in a

311
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,449
future generation that they can take

312
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:20,140
over and make our world a better place

313
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:21,550
let's make that a 15% security yeah you

314
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,480
know we look at kind of the the last

315
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,339
couple of years in mention the first

316
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,430
surgery was done in 2013 and you know

317
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:29,680
some of the you know awareness is

318
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,239
starting to increase right so you know

319
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,550
teachers mentioned security being a

320
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,100
career option you know this past year it

321
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,800
seems like 54% of the Millennials were

322
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,410
surveyed were were aware of computer

323
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,260
security as a profession kind of that

324
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,390
same survey about 40% reported that they

325
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,390
knew what the job tasks of security

326
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,949
professionals actually were have been in

327
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,399
this industry for 10 years and I still

328
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,390
don't know what those job tasks are but

329
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,370
maybe I should have surveyed the same

330
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:02,260
folks Raytheon did in the hotel helped

331
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,670
us put together this presentation so you

332
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,170
know one of the things to kind of poke

333
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,610
out here and I know the text is a little

334
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,469
bit hard to read here but on the left

335
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,449
side you have yeah so this is a graph of

336
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:16,000
all folks awarded bachelor degrees from

337
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:17,680
institutions between 2009 and 2010 and

338
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,240
if you look at kind of that left side of

339
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,800
the graph there's a section on computers

340
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,600
and it's less than 4% of all bachelor

341
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,699
degrees that are coming out and so if we

342
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,070
limit computer security to only those

343
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:32,050
computer related majors you know we're

344
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,970
not getting that that real diversity of

345
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,130
perspectives and awareness at the

346
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,160
collegiate level absolutely so for

347
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,339
example right here is a mention of law

348
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,339
enforcement

349
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,640
let's take medical devices whether it's

350
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,560
insulin pumps blood pressure monitors

351
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,660
pacemakers right have all had security

352
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,670
breaches how many people have confidence

353
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,310
in their local police department or a

354
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,040
state of Connecticut law enforcement in

355
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:09,899
being able to detect that one someone

356
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:12,180
does an injection attack right we got a

357
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,680
problem here right so there's other

358
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,510
things that we can do to start

359
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,670
connecting the dots in terms of the

360
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,980
different majors on this particular side

361
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,050
right whether it's public administration

362
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,630
we have to understand how to connect

363
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,569
security principles into the FDA right

364
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,900
because we got the FDA approving medical

365
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,879
devices right without any security

366
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,250
awareness right we can understand things

367
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,620
like visual arts right maybe if you

368
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,000
start coming up with visualization to

369
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,310
reports and the new ways to visualize

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,490
information we could start seeing

371
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:48,570
certain threats and vulnerabilities to

372
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,710
our ecosystem yeah you know one again

373
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,389
one of the things as we were

374
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,430
interviewing different folks leading up

375
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,290
to this talk was I had a great

376
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,700
conversation with an individual that was

377
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,000
leading the threat and malware

378
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,370
organization and he shared a story about

379
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,540
actually one of the folks he just hired

380
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,159
non-technical background came out of

381
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,629
communications well you know what do you

382
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,010
need for you know from the

383
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,470
communications domain related to

384
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,450
security well it turns out folks that

385
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,180
are good at communicating and can speak

386
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,280
multiple languages can't you know tend

387
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,000
to have certain skill sets that are

388
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,590
highly divided desired by certain

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,960
government organizations that are

390
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,169
looking for potential threats and

391
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,660
languages that you know as a kind of a

392
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:32,370
primarily english-speaking country you

393
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,680
know we may not necessarily be exposed

394
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,199
to so I think that's just kind of one

395
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,570
example where you know if we get some of

396
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,120
this awareness out into these different

397
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:45,360
kind of majors at our last one of our

398
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,760
recent UConn sessions we challenged some

399
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,770
of the students at the cybersecurity

400
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,270
Club there to pull in folks from the

401
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,920
business school the medical school the

402
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,650
law school so that we can kind of get

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,790
those security conversations going for

404
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,380
some of those future

405
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,490
business leaders and medical

406
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:12,390
professionals alright James how do we

407
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:16,350
fix this waiting to start a computing

408
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:18,450
security career at a later age is the

409
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,610
wrong thing I've already pointed out why

410
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,590
I think school systems need to

411
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,050
particularly change in terms of their

412
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,270
thought processes how many people are

413
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:32,820
familiar at roots asylum it's kind of

414
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:36,360
important to know that if you've ever

415
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,030
heard of the DEF CON as a hacking

416
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,510
convention they have what's called

417
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:47,760
routes Asylum and it's the DEF CON for

418
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:51,180
kids it's held in parallel so if the

419
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,160
opportunity learn from from adults and

420
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,950
they're guided through learning crystals

421
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,290
or learned that they understand social

422
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,510
engineering those types of things great

423
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,550
vacation to take your kids on if you

424
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,070
truly want to expose them through the

425
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:08,450
real world these are my two sons they

426
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,310
both went a couple of years ago

427
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,840
participated in routes Asylum and one of

428
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,820
the really cool things that they do

429
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,560
there is is that they actually teach

430
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,260
them how to break things these guys

431
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,730
found the bug in a Samsung TV and they

432
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,490
give out scholarships and things like

433
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,610
that for the kids so a great way to kind

434
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,660
of connect that at a very early age this

435
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,830
year the United States are under

436
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,690
realizes that they need to start

437
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,899
teaching kids as well and started

438
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,520
sponsoring many of the events there

439
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,260
there's a lot of events like that that

440
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,940
are kind of occurring and we have to

441
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,070
figure out how to bring the same thing

442
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,070
to children in Connecticut

443
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,940
in terms of academic institutions right

444
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,120
I think you've got the sense that we

445
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,520
need interdisciplinary programs right if

446
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,459
we are going to procure secure software

447
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,020
right we need to make sure that people

448
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,210
that understand finance people

449
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,280
understand law right it's not just about

450
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,770
us coding it anymore but making sure

451
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,750
that the ecosystem is secure and that we

452
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,570
can spread our goodness our standards

453
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,930
our practices in a legally sound

454
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,370
framework we need to include computer

455
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,990
security courses and non-homicide

456
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,909
degrees and we need to have an

457
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:32,910
environment where classes are taught by

458
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:35,040
practitioners that action is right

459
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,890
security is one of those things that we

460
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,720
can teach a lot of around but the best

461
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,480
way to learn to for example great

462
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,650
software is my freaking solved one so

463
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,420
let's make sure that we set up

464
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,820
environments where we bring in the

465
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,990
thrust and brightest of operations and

466
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,149
learner from them right we need to move

467
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,880
beyond theory and get this into modern

468
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,580
corporate environments we need to

469
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,690
revisit a charm okay a charge is

470
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,399
fundamentally propably

471
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,560
a lot of different reasons in terms of

472
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,200
their way of thinking all right got a

473
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,090
drop the calm side degree requirement we

474
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,580
got to drop some of those certifications

475
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:16,709
right and get like true talent skills

476
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,129
that are there right we have got people

477
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,530
who can think like attackers we need to

478
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,030
establish non technical security career

479
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:29,090
cracks yeah you talk about things like

480
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:31,350
visualization but we can do that

481
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,030
connecting the enterprise architecture

482
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,560
might be another track that we figure

483
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,370
out how to connect those knives there

484
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,620
right ability to shift some of the more

485
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,070
rudimentary testing like business logic

486
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,649
flaws and holes

487
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,540
to a quality assurance track those types

488
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,880
of things right because if we're not all

489
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,490
doing security right

490
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:58,800
none of us are doing security so let's

491
00:22:51,490 --> 00:23:02,200
hopefully think about how we might cool

492
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,450
you know so as James mentioned you know

493
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,580
let's try to open some of those doors up

494
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,740
in our community and our ecosystem so

495
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,290
that we can kind of start getting that

496
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,980
more diverse pipeline into the the

497
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,570
security space so you know for those

498
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,100
folks in the room kind of either looking

499
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,200
for a security job or looking to pivot

500
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,179
to some different domains let's talk

501
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,270
about some of those tracks so I know

502
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,950
there's a lot going on here but um you

503
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,160
know I really liked this picture from

504
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,380
Henry Jiang he's one of the sis's over

505
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,210
at open hi Marin company and it really

506
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,180
gives a nice visual and ladle and a

507
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,670
variety of security disciplines if you

508
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,740
know a security discipline that is not

509
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,080
reflected here feel free to shout it out

510
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,220
you know we'll get that added to the to

511
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,199
the graph and you know it's not the

512
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,970
complete taxonomy of all the different

513
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,560
domains but I think it does a really

514
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,170
good job of trying to break it up into

515
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,460
different domains you know that we'll

516
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,460
talk through some of the coming slides

517
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,980
all right so one of the other things we

518
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,100
wanted to kind of build into this being

519
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,770
kind of on the Builder breaker and

520
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,870
defender kind of track is to really

521
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,610
think of a visual way to depict where

522
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,919
some of these skillsets kind of overlap

523
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,250
right and so depending on kind of where

524
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,300
you are in your career there's certain

525
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,340
places where some of those technical

526
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,080
security skills overlap so you can

527
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,929
easily try to pivot into some of those

528
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,939
types of roles so you know one example

529
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,220
might be vulnerability management you

530
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,720
know we can kind of see it's a long kind

531
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,880
of the offender path that has kind of a

532
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,290
breaker aspect to it and so you know to

533
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,930
really understand those vulnerabilities

534
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,820
to manage them you do have to have a

535
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,590
sharpening kind of skill set around

536
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,730
you know how do you exploit some of

537
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,049
those vulnerabilities to really

538
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,049
understand some of the impact of that

539
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,210
James anything you wanted to add here

540
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:09,590
cool so initially I went down this route

541
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:11,390
of kind of using the NIST 801 81 as a

542
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,230
framework to provide a taxonomy of

543
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,179
technical security skill sets you know

544
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,620
this isn't you know not everyone

545
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,289
necessarily has to use necesita

546
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,590
undergoing anyone but it just was it was

547
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:26,809
one of those few documents I kind of

548
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,789
came across which really tried to do a

549
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:30,590
holistic job at classifying all sorts of

550
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,500
different type of technical skills and

551
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:36,830
so next time you see yet another job req

552
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,419
for a computer security analyst you

553
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,029
might be able to use this to kind of

554
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:44,240
decipher and distill down what types of

555
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:46,520
technical skills might be required in

556
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,100
typical in this format they go to town

557
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,570
and 10,000 appendices for you know

558
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,549
different knowledge --iz and skills and

559
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:57,168
abilities that are required but again

560
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:59,899
it's a starting place for for defining

561
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:01,750
some of these more technical security

562
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:11,809
skill sets that are needed today

563
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:13,880
absolutely as we look at right we're

564
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,428
starting to see things like blockchain

565
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,980
we're seeing Internet of Things those

566
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:22,000
types of technologies right those occur

567
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,250
outside of your organization right so

568
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,620
focusing solely on the internals here is

569
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,809
good for DES but we have to stretch our

570
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:34,600
imaginations such that we're dealing

571
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:34,600
with the ecosystem going forward

572
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,919
all right and again you know one

573
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,420
application of this framework is you can

574
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,299
kind of start bucketing the different

575
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,950
types of jobs you know either at the

576
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,120
national level or in Connecticut and I

577
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,640
thought this was kind of an interesting

578
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,520
visual way you know I think I guess in

579
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,470
Connecticut we have more of a demand or

580
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,020
you know or folks focused on the

581
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,640
analysis space you know I think that

582
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:05,490
category switched around at the national

583
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:07,559
level compared to protect and defend so

584
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,049
I mentioned some of the interviews I had

585
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,580
conducted within our security community

586
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:15,418
and so what I kind of came out of that

587
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,590
is some of these profiles for a common

588
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:21,270
career path map back to these more

589
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,010
technical security skills as well as non

590
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,460
technical skills so again I know it's

591
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,690
pretty heavy slide here but this would

592
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,790
map back to the security governance

593
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,740
track you saw in that big picture with

594
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,740
all the the pretty colors

595
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,390
this particular individual you know was

596
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,809
kind of going down more of a senior

597
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,929
manager type role in the vulnerability

598
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:44,250
management space and as we kind of talk

599
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,169
through some of those technical skills

600
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,200
you can kind of see you know there's a

601
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:52,190
lot of skill sets around some of those

602
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,770
securely provisioning systems and

603
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:58,260
devices there's some amount as their

604
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,730
career progressed in the oversee in

605
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,760
governance area around strategic

606
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,559
planning and policy and then being in

607
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,140
the vulnerability management space a lot

608
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,690
of focus on and protect and defend type

609
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,270
of skill sets some of the non-technical

610
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,460
skills required for more of kind of a

611
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,870
governance and management track so

612
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,600
unsurprisingly communication

613
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,780
communicating with stakeholders at a

614
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,149
variety of different levels you know as

615
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,910
you grow in responsibility and authority

616
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,370
and organization being able to manage a

617
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,559
group of people to achieve a security

618
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,820
objective was also important and

619
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,460
ultimately a lot of what I heard through

620
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,870
these some of these interviews for folks

621
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,480
going down the security governance track

622
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,939
is also accountability right kind of

623
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,190
seeing through different projects they

624
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,620
get the organization to a more secure

625
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:52,710
state

626
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:54,389
and you want to add James cool shifting

627
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,700
over to more of the security

628
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:59,010
architecture track again you'll see a

629
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,659
lot of folks typically are spending a

630
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,179
lot of time also you know still in that

631
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:06,570
security provisioning type skill set but

632
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:08,820
also complementing that with in the

633
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,860
operation and maintain aspect of it

634
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,928
customer service and support kind of

635
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,699
focus and so when you think of

636
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,370
architects and understanding

637
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,039
requirements understanding employees and

638
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,449
business and security leader needs and

639
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,600
you know working to develop solutions

640
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,070
that fit their needs you know I think

641
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,799
with some of these common career path

642
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,049
tracks what you can do is you know I

643
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,490
kind of had this vision building out to

644
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:33,779
this where you know if you could kind of

645
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,490
go through your resume and pull out

646
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,809
these technical skills and you built

647
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,100
this picture what would yours kind of

648
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,200
look like right because I could give you

649
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,959
an indication of some career tracks that

650
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,179
you could potentially pivot to for folks

651
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,710
that are just entering into security I

652
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,210
hope this gives you guys an idea of

653
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,519
maybe some of those technical security

654
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,649
skillsets that might make sense to focus

655
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,600
on you know whether you want to be a

656
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,340
secure architect or someone doing

657
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,580
penetration testing and so on and so

658
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,529
forth any questions just on kind of how

659
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,899
these slides are laid out I know it

660
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:05,639
makes super sense to me when I reviewed

661
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:07,830
it with my fiancee last night she said

662
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:10,799
what the heck is going on on this slide

663
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:14,340
Alvin so if you guys have questions feel

664
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,750
free to ask you know how this you know

665
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,840
there's obviously all that back kind of

666
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,190
this framework but hopefully this

667
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,199
provides kind of a neat little visual

668
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:28,139
package for folks to see some of those

669
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:30,360
paths the third track here that I tried

670
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,309
to to build kind of a little profile for

671
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,709
was focusing around security operations

672
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:37,769
and so a few of these individuals you

673
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:40,500
know start off on the software side got

674
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:42,360
into the security side and that's kind

675
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,549
of went down further deeper into the

676
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,350
reverse engineering side I've kind of

677
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:48,750
reached this state as more of a group

678
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,340
lead and so unsurprisingly they spend a

679
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:55,090
lot of their time analyzing threats and

680
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:57,639
exploits and in addition to

681
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,350
you know categorizing risk in the

682
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,480
security provisioning areas as well as

683
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,719
building up the infrastructure and

684
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,780
analysis infrastructure to support some

685
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,550
of those analysis activities you know

686
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,170
I'm sure you've noticed by now a common

687
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,930
theme around communication literally

688
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,030
every interview I conducted folks you

689
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,440
know mentioned communication as one of

690
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,780
those critical skill sets that only

691
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,300
really gets more increased focus and

692
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:28,270
increases in importance as your security

693
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:30,850
careers mature all right

694
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:34,000
finally I want to play out the risk

695
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,530
assessment side and unsurprisingly it

696
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,440
starts with the risk management focus

697
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:41,530
but it also involves a lot of education

698
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,260
and awareness and communication as you

699
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,920
get more senior on especially with

700
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,770
executives right helping folks

701
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,380
understand what the risk is and then

702
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:53,190
also supporting you and mitigating it in

703
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,180
programming around risk management

704
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,920
similarly you know more in the computer

705
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,330
security space vulnerability assessment

706
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,300
and those types of management skills

707
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:06,280
become a pretty obvious focal skill set

708
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:08,050
so you can't do a security talk on

709
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,510
careers without answering the second

710
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,399
most popular question outside of word of

711
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:16,629
start and security why answering the

712
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,160
question of certifications so as part of

713
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,110
that scene this project they also did

714
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,960
kind of a supply and demand almost of

715
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,399
all the different certifications at the

716
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,200
national on the left is the national

717
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,050
level on the right is the Connecticut

718
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,790
level what's in orange is folks that

719
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,000
have those certifications and what's in

720
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,170
blue are openings requesting

721
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,080
certification so we talked a little bit

722
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:40,150
about the HR job function earlier what

723
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,250
I'll share is every interview said

724
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:46,120
certifications were important because

725
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,310
the job recs required it and every

726
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,989
individual also said once they got into

727
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,570
that job those certifications provided

728
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,880
little to zero value after obtaining it

729
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,530
so we got to fix this kind of

730
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,530
certification thing that's going on here

731
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,290
so one of the other things I wanted to

732
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,330
do was spend a little bit of time

733
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,129
talking about industry fits and I know

734
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,199
there's exceptions in every industry and

735
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,600
this is you know from my personal

736
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,550
experience you know being in the federal

737
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,860
space healthcare large enterprises and

738
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:21,810
now consulting just want to share some

739
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,580
of the observations of pros and cons of

740
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:27,389
each you know different types of

741
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,550
industry I think the security research

742
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:33,090
and consulting space gets you a lot of

743
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:36,120
exposure to a variety of organizations

744
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:38,189
as well as really sharp and talented

745
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,540
talented individuals across a lot of

746
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,790
different industries and so for someone

747
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:45,060
starting out in the career you know it

748
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:48,810
could make a lot of sense to to be part

749
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:51,659
of a security research organization or a

750
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,770
consulting organization now you know

751
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,290
like I mentioned there's pros and cons

752
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:57,120
of each I can personally attest on the

753
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,070
consulting side after doing three weeks

754
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,260
of traveling that is definitely a con in

755
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:06,590
my book but you know one thing that was

756
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,989
neat working in the defense industry was

757
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,819
you really do get yeah you know careers

758
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:13,739
in use cases in defense and government

759
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,350
space that you really don't see anywhere

760
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,449
else right so I'm sure you guys see a

761
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,600
lot of news articles about Romania

762
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:25,290
Russia China etc hacking to us what do

763
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,480
you think we're doing to them right so

764
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,159
we talked about red teaming a lot in the

765
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,530
private industry but you know the

766
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,339
defense organizations just take it to a

767
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,600
whole another level and you know for

768
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,010
enterprises right and you know you're

769
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,409
the type of individual that likes to

770
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,570
focus on scaling problems leading

771
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,850
transformations that's definitely a

772
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:48,860
pretty hot space in the space to

773
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,860
consider James

774
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:57,790
cool alright so shifting over to some of

775
00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:00,849
these career pipeline entry points I

776
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,740
wanted just the touch upon kind of how

777
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,050
folks have gotten into security in the

778
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,299
past president future again not meaning

779
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,150
for this to be in totality but you know

780
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,430
and a lot of interviews that we

781
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,990
conducted you know kind of makes sense a

782
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,230
lot of folks started out system

783
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,660
administrators network administrators

784
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,520
software developers you know or they had

785
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,220
computer science or information systems

786
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,540
type backgrounds because you know in

787
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,299
each one of those respective domains

788
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,558
they had to have a deep knowledge and

789
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,349
expertise so they kind of knew those

790
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,630
systems or software code in and out and

791
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,920
those that had a curiosity into security

792
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:39,670
was able to kind of use that as a

793
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,980
launching pad into their there's you

794
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,500
know you know more full-time security

795
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,240
focuses I think nowadays what you see a

796
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,990
lot of is kind of this risk flavoring

797
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,899
everyone's all about IT risk management

798
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,549
you know we're getting more data and as

799
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,869
a result I think data scientists are

800
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,700
kind of getting pulled into the loop

801
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:00,910
here in terms of being able to say hey

802
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,500
we feel like this is a high risk why you

803
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,910
know and I think it's that good

804
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,290
collaboration with folks with the more

805
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,109
data science focus where you can answer

806
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:10,119
some of those questions we also start

807
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:13,960
you know have started to see an increase

808
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:16,750
in career in majors around you know

809
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,670
bachelor's master's PhD programs that

810
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,309
you know start off with computer

811
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,809
security personally I remember when I

812
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:25,180
was going through college I had to take

813
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:28,150
graduate courses or I had to be a grad

814
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:32,140
student to take computer security

815
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,549
courses at all and which actually is one

816
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,500
of the reasons I jumped at an

817
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:37,690
accelerated masters but you know the

818
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,579
good thing nowadays I think folks are

819
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,530
you know in schools are kind of coming

820
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:46,119
around to just starting to teach the set

821
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:48,130
of undergrad level so you know that kind

822
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:49,329
of shifts us into some of the more you

823
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,080
know future kind of trends that are

824
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:54,180
coming down the line

825
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,420
in terms of you know as we move from the

826
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,200
present to the future what sort of

827
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,380
technologies and what's going to be the

828
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,399
security professional of the future

829
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,570
James I don't know if you have some

830
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,570
thoughts you wanted to share their

831
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:28,500
beliefs of having that strong math

832
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:30,990
Braille will help you with AI blockchain

833
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,760
is a really interesting particularly use

834
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,729
case in the sense that people aren't

835
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,590
going to necessarily try to think about

836
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,830
security solely through the Lindt of

837
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,970
cryptography and whether they complete

838
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:46,110
break in particular block in the chain

839
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,839
but rather they're going to go after

840
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,240
other aspects of it so if you look at

841
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,530
the blockchain especially Bigpoint

842
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,779
you'll see that no one's broke in the

843
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,300
chain but people still figured out how

844
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,270
to steal money and feel coins and those

845
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,270
types of things right from wallets and

846
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:06,020
other things in the ecosystem so as you

847
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:08,520
guys start building out blockchain

848
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,259
applications whether it's a policy

849
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,380
administration claims ministration

850
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,000
billing payment that type of thing the

851
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,800
weakest source will not be the chain

852
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,550
itself but it will be the things that

853
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,550
hang on to

854
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,380
at it through that particular range this

855
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,980
is actually going on threat model that

856
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:29,680
is ecosystem aware and it's going to be

857
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,990
critically important when we think about

858
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,509
things like Internet of Things right

859
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:37,149
we're now going to have more devices

860
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:40,990
that have an Internet address that are

861
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,440
just automated that we are going to have

862
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:51,609
that are going to be human control a

863
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:53,320
value scenario where you know they could

864
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,800
go down the turnpike and try to break

865
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,740
into

866
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:02,640
eversource right or they can go after

867
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:02,640
the best devices all right just have fun

868
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,770
what does that sound like sounds like

869
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,270
what the wasps would call an anti

870
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:15,400
automation automation if I were to ask

871
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,210
security professionals in terms of IOT

872
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,830
what's their defense for anti automation

873
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:24,700
you know how many blanks there is that

874
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:26,740
yet so there's some things that we need

875
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,410
to do and start thinking about in that

876
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:40,120
particular space especially around IOT

877
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:42,089
going forward cool so kind of taking it

878
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,890
back to to some of the different

879
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,140
computer security jobs right so if you

880
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,990
believe all the news right so security

881
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,990
security spending is increasing jobs are

882
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:56,649
unfilled damages are going over 9,000

883
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,350
bajillion right so you know it's pizza

884
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,920
pretty rosy picture you know in some of

885
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,630
the research we were actually doing you

886
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,980
know from who kind of came from this

887
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,870
side of cyber security ventures when you

888
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,280
start looking into the data I would kind

889
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,960
of caution you guys when you you know

890
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,610
when you you know anytime you hear an

891
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,680
arc or something with the data sources

892
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,960
some of these sites just literally have

893
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,730
no data source and it's just really just

894
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,740
clickbait and pushing out these articles

895
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,870
the paint a picture focused on some

896
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,220
agenda that try and accomplish but you

897
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,440
know everything is on the up-and-up

898
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,080
right and it kind of made me think of

899
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,420
where have we seen this type of cycle

900
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,509
before right and so on the graph on the

901
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,880
Left right this is

902
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:40,310
a chart between 2000 and 2010 of jobs in

903
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,900
Silicon Valley Valley I'm sure a lot of

904
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,690
folks in the room experience going

905
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,580
through that dot-com bubble explosion

906
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,290
right so I feel like security is kind of

907
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,170
here on the upswing and we're headed for

908
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:53,090
that cliff and in a similar way of you

909
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,430
know on the right side is employment and

910
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:58,070
computer Silicon Valley high-tech

911
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,049
businesses from 2000 and 2009 you know a

912
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,450
lot of these legacy kind of security

913
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,550
jobs or security jobs of the past right

914
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,240
are probably gonna get gutted

915
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,770
immediately after we fall off that cliff

916
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,649
so what are some things that we can

917
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:16,850
potentially do here for as we think

918
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:54,560
about what the future's going to look

919
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:56,330
like right so there's technologies

920
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,700
coming out in this particular space that

921
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,380
are gonna add business context to wallet

922
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,960
such that they know what they're looking

923
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,800
at we need to have Identity and Access

924
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Management

925
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,540
that's all this federated problem we got

926
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,140
to go deeper than that we got to start

927
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:15,020
converging physical and logical right so

928
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,750
imagine a scenario where someone in this

929
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:20,240
particular Bank is you know logging on

930
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,400
in the parking lot right we don't tend

931
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,490
to correlate those two things but we

932
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,040
should going forward we got to

933
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,620
understand a data governance we move a

934
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,900
lot

935
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:35,810
yeah services whatever right that we're

936
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,510
not doing the basics of that very well

937
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,220
either give you an example many

938
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,130
companies are building Web Services

939
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,959
Microsoft's is those types of things

940
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:46,880
vast majority security departments will

941
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,680
of course open up the firewall so let

942
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,530
all about traffic through they help make

943
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,810
sure there's strong identity right but

944
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,610
they don't ever look at that payload in

945
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,210
web services you can do something as

946
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:01,520
simple as access these string okay which

947
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,140
means that it has no input validation no

948
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,020
regular expression they don't specify

949
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,509
the amount of fines that have occurred

950
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,520
and therefore you're just creating more

951
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:14,090
more holes as we keep punching holes

952
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,220
into the firewall embedded security

953
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:19,160
program we're going down Internet of

954
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,779
Things and this is an interesting top

955
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,330
right because we're starting to buy

956
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:26,300
consumer devices to do many different

957
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:28,370
things imagine a scenario where someone

958
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,760
determines that you can put Google home

959
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:34,520
devices in your legal department to save

960
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,710
money on a lawyer or transcription right

961
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,660
lawyers like to go Baba blah blah blah

962
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,150
right and therefore you might want to

963
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,700
automate that using home type technology

964
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,970
so imagine if we're not understanding

965
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,310
how to do security analysis on those

966
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:52,100
types of devices and we created a

967
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,140
particular problem space advanced

968
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,440
network engineering is going to a very

969
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,450
very interesting place this week it was

970
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,580
the gardener symposium that day there

971
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,939
are companies working on things called

972
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:07,520
dispersive technologies where they are

973
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,010
changing up and springing routes right

974
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,790
so you'll have let's say for example if

975
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,100
you're routing

976
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,470
normally right all traffic to I don't

977
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:18,110
know Galgo goes this path all traffic to

978
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,149
a o L goes this path they're working on

979
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:23,330
dispersive technologies such that the

980
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,100
packets it evenly spread right to

981
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,410
prevent sniffing and those types of

982
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,180
things and when you're starting in

983
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,790
spring things and you're spraying things

984
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,078
securely across different routes right

985
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:36,400
you can replace

986
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,619
technologies as well so it's an

987
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,390
important a different conceptual way of

988
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,869
thinking about that google dispersive

989
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:48,729
technologies for homework in terms of

990
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:51,400
kind of cloud right right so we're

991
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:54,129
putting things into containers that we

992
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,789
do not control we are even going towards

993
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:59,799
model called surrealist computing where

994
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:03,900
we're just focus solely on the business

995
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:03,900
logic right so it's not about pointing

996
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:12,749
we have to get a lot smarter in terms of

997
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,150
understanding business logic and

998
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:18,009
variants that occur there for us to get

999
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,509
the skillsets right so those are some of

1000
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:29,829
the things that we need to kind of start

1001
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:32,710
thinking about all right so you know how

1002
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:34,539
do we you know in kind of pushing

1003
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,859
forward on that you know how do we

1004
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,660
prepare for kind of that up clumb

1005
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,130
upcoming cliff Security's headed down

1006
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,229
you know what are some different

1007
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,319
security paths that you might be able to

1008
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:46,450
focus in on and I'm sure there was some

1009
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:54,609
influence here but somehow we arrived at

1010
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:57,460
the quadrant gene so you know I think a

1011
00:45:54,609 --> 00:46:00,219
lot of the the safer kind of security

1012
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,989
tracks here right you know maybe for

1013
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:03,579
folks kind of mid-career and things that

1014
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:06,670
you're always going to need someone to

1015
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:08,619
manage security staff right companies

1016
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,210
are always going to have vendors there's

1017
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:13,900
always going to be some education and

1018
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,910
security component to the profession

1019
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,920
right I think there's some things that

1020
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:20,399
are a little bit more also going down

1021
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,829
innovative paths that we're not really

1022
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,289
focusing on as an industry you know a

1023
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,880
few of the guys from lodestone are here

1024
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:29,650
in the room today Keith's constantly

1025
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,569
harp on this every other week but

1026
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,369
privacy and usability right who's

1027
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:37,299
designing those types of solutions who's

1028
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:39,039
making security usable you know for

1029
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,960
business owners security is always just

1030
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,380
seen as something that gives them less

1031
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,250
usability right so you know another kind

1032
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,960
of more

1033
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,170
what I affectionately called the dead

1034
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,840
zone is careers where you know is

1035
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:55,460
starting to become more commoditized and

1036
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,470
again apologize to the folks on my team

1037
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,480
but I think penetration testing is

1038
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:02,839
headed down that cliff as well you know

1039
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,190
network scanning and security really

1040
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,840
feels funny saying that on the

1041
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:10,550
consulting side during penetration

1042
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,590
sessions but we'll see so you know the

1043
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,000
concept of IT auditors right and you

1044
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:16,070
know James mentioned a little bit about

1045
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,500
blockchain and you have you know

1046
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,900
cryptographic principles around kind of

1047
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,060
auditing and securing that trail who the

1048
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:27,010
hell needs an IT audit of anymore are

1049
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:32,180
there any actors in the room all right

1050
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:33,680
no one at least willing to admit it now

1051
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,000
kind of following laws of supply and

1052
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,879
demand right you know you can always

1053
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,910
target some of those more niche security

1054
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,500
career paths you know that that not you

1055
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:44,600
know everyone is doing although I know

1056
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,950
Robert came on earlier and threat

1057
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,839
modeling we were chatting a little bit

1058
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,759
about oh was-- right at some point that

1059
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,590
was nishan now it seems to be all you

1060
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,910
know very much kind of in vogue in

1061
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,950
something that all companies are talking

1062
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,299
about the downside of those potential

1063
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,299
initial career paths though of course

1064
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,070
are you know at some point they may just

1065
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:04,880
kind of fall off that cliff when it's no

1066
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:06,470
longer popular or you know kind of go

1067
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,920
the way of COBOL let's say right as

1068
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:13,100
James kind of mentioned earlier on the

1069
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,240
x-axis there was a little bit of I don't

1070
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,279
know folks that kind of caught in the

1071
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:29,750
room more of the James actor you could

1072
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:32,870
probably explain that one right so I'll

1073
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,070
call it the traditional INTJ towards the

1074
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:36,740
left right you know

1075
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:39,140
introverted that type of thing right and

1076
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,000
you're judgmental really good if that's

1077
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,650
your personality type to getting the

1078
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,570
malware analysis right

1079
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,250
you can hide out at your desk and do pen

1080
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,500
testing right you don't have to talk to

1081
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:52,370
those nasty business people like you

1082
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:57,590
know understand but if you go over here

1083
00:48:52,370 --> 00:49:00,620
to the entp right MTPs are energized by

1084
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,300
communication right so you know we got

1085
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,359
over there we got things like threat

1086
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,820
bottling and you know up top right you

1087
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:11,600
know security DevOps right because we

1088
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:15,260
got to start selling right you cannot be

1089
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,810
effective as a threat model right if you

1090
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,820
don't want to engage in people right so

1091
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:22,160
make sure that you're thinking about you

1092
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,110
know not just in terms of skills but in

1093
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,009
terms of your own personality to guide

1094
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,350
your career

1095
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:29,900
the other dimension I will say that's

1096
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:32,480
somewhat less apparent in this

1097
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,320
particular model is I will say that

1098
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,340
everything over on this particular side

1099
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:43,340
you're a hero

1100
00:49:37,340 --> 00:50:01,660
when you get a win you penetrate a

1101
00:49:43,340 --> 00:50:04,400
network to penetrate something lasting

1102
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,899
but when you're over here in terms of

1103
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,410
threat modeling or you're working on

1104
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:16,250
privacy right that's the harder work

1105
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:17,990
right takes longer to get cred so think

1106
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,460
about it through a couple so when you're

1107
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,500
laying out your skills don't just think

1108
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,150
about it as I need to know X Y & Z I

1109
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:28,320
want you to think about in terms of your

1110
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:31,210
personality thanks James

1111
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,550
[Laughter]

1112
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:37,900
every every one or two weeks for myself

1113
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:39,610
personally James but all right so yeah I

1114
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:42,310
know we're running a little bit out of

1115
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:44,830
time here but you know I wanted to

1116
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:46,660
provide some resources and again kind of

1117
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:49,540
did the mapping to kind of in this

1118
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,520
framework here right there's one of the

1119
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,600
former colleagues I had had worked at

1120
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,240
when I was in the federal and defense

1121
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,250
industry work at a company called mitre

1122
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,140
came up watch a site open security

1123
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:00,850
training info and literally they

1124
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,830
recorded every training that we went

1125
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,980
through and what was known as the mitre

1126
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:07,410
Institute everything from x86 intro to

1127
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,730
that to reverse engineering

1128
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,160
vulnerability assessments rootkits

1129
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:15,190
etc and published it all and made it all

1130
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,990
open probably much to the chagrin of the

1131
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:22,300
mitre overlords but you know and there's

1132
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:24,339
you know earlier this year at b-sides

1133
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,290
Boston they did a whole track just on

1134
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,700
non-injured engineering security crews

1135
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:30,670
and I thought that was good to highlight

1136
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,049
for folks as we mentioned kind of at the

1137
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,790
beginning of this talk you know that are

1138
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,660
not necessarily in engineering fields

1139
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,060
what are some of the different

1140
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:38,230
opportunities that are available there

1141
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,940
and of course there's all sorts of

1142
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,710
conference talks on YouTube was--

1143
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:45,550
besides comm that are published and

1144
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:47,350
available if you guys can develop some

1145
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:49,030
sort of AI machine learning algorithm

1146
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,259
for like sorting through those talks so

1147
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,060
that you know instead of searching

1148
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,890
through all of them right I can just go

1149
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,450
I want to learn about pentesting and and

1150
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:58,390
have it just come back with all those I

1151
00:51:55,450 --> 00:52:04,180
think there is a start-up security for

1152
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:06,370
you finally she also mentioned you know

1153
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,770
some of the folks on our team was using

1154
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:10,299
this and I was starting to dig into it

1155
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,980
and these aren't all the classes

1156
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,150
available at cyber area well what I

1157
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,640
liked about them was a lot of their

1158
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:17,140
courses are open source and free but if

1159
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,180
you're looking at pivot to different

1160
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,640
technical areas definitely check out

1161
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,319
their repository they've got a bunch of

1162
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,379
great talks and pretty much all the

1163
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,480
different security domains to at least

1164
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,760
you know kind of get a start and getting

1165
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,760
a little bit smarter in these areas

1166
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:40,540
all right so my secret hidden agenda was

1167
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:48,770
to talk a little bit about mentorship

1168
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:51,320
and I'm gonna send you know one of the

1169
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:55,640
things that James and I have been

1170
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:57,590
talking about was kind of more from the

1171
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:04,190
mentoring angle right you know we talked

1172
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:05,660
about kind of that apprenticeship was

1173
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,030
trying to figure out you know folks that

1174
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,310
are out there are there folks that are

1175
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:12,110
open to mentoring kind of others as well

1176
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:14,360
as folks in the room that may be looking

1177
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:16,850
for mentorship markdown if you're a

1178
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:20,420
builder breaker or defender and we want

1179
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,980
to kind of start an initiative to so

1180
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,450
kind of help out you know at the end of

1181
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,920
the day it's a community right it's a

1182
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,020
security community here in Connecticut

1183
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,090
and it's a unique community and I think

1184
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,680
the more that we can do in terms of not

1185
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,119
just looking at websites and things that

1186
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,310
will teach you the technical training

1187
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:35,990
but actual the people-focused sides you

1188
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:40,420
know the resources that we have here in

1189
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:40,419
Connecticut as a community I think I

1190
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,940
mean I think that was that was pretty

1191
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:58,340
much the enemy I know James if you had

1192
00:53:49,940 --> 00:54:00,880
any takeaways not just think about in

1193
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,710
terms of current state market demand

1194
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,079
in terms of job boards and skills that

1195
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:07,059
they're asking for but to essentially

1196
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:10,229
align over the future state technologies

1197
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:14,650
that we know we're coming down the pike

1198
00:54:10,229 --> 00:54:16,269
solve the pipeline problem right all of

1199
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,009
us are professionals rights and are

1200
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:20,288
later we're going to retire and we

1201
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:23,109
better leave our pensions and all of

1202
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:24,849
that other stuff in good hands unless we

1203
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:27,640
want those back to when it will be

1204
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:29,380
broken elderly thing so there's a

1205
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,180
festive interest in investing in the

1206
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,999
view solving some of the particular

1207
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,348
challenges of academia and demanding

1208
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:40,058
more and better in terms of that

1209
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:41,890
understand how the pipeline is changing

1210
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:44,739
let's make sure that we're not just

1211
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:46,900
adding people because it's an in-demand

1212
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:50,650
skill and we create more supply than

1213
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:52,239
demand but rather we all focus on areas

1214
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,970
such that there's an even distribution

1215
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:57,460
and coverage and of course we're going

1216
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:59,618
to focus on things that avoid things

1217
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:04,119
that might be potentially automated

1218
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:07,119
right think about some of your tools

1219
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,680
like using and strengthening your resume

1220
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,539
one of the things I'm going to say about

1221
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,479
resume is is that in this particular

1222
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:16,029
scenario don't make you make sure that

1223
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:19,390
you just address skills but you start

1224
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:22,089
addressing outcomes this is increasingly

1225
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:27,069
becoming something that's on the radar

1226
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:28,989
in terms of the board's executive you

1227
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:31,330
saw that the dollar figures are going

1228
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:34,040
out bringing they're going up higher

1229
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,810
awesome inflation so we better be

1230
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:43,610
putting things in a dollars and cents

1231
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:44,960
term yeah yeah and I know Rowan Romans

1232
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,420
throwing me death stares here I think

1233
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,040
we're going overtime a bit so yeah so

1234
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,600
for the mentorship aspect you know we're

1235
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,610
gonna collect those sheets again if

1236
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,990
folks are interested in volunteering to

1237
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,430
help kind of drive that forward I think

1238
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:57,259
that's definitely something that we want

1239
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,419
to focus part of this year and the

1240
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,750
coming year on in terms of helping to

1241
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,610
build our security community so thanks

1242
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,160
everyone was a pleasure getting up here

1243
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:10,530
to speak today

1244
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,529
[Applause]

1245
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:21,160
you
