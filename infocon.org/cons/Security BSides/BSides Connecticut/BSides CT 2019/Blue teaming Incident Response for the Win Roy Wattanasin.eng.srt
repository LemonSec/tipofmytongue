Massachusetts plates so basically I'm

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,070

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,739

19

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,350
that's a lot it's mostly pictures and

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,060
references as well and so I'm going to

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,640
kind of go through them really fast and

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,170
pretty much have try to have some time

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,610
for questions as well and so these 50

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,430
slides I'm trying to probably go in

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,460
about maybe about 40 minutes hopefully

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,890
40 or 45 minutes with 15 minutes for

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,130
questions as well so yeah so first off

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,900
I'm Roy wah Tennyson and basically we're

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,810
going to talk about blue tea me

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,060
mostly on the Windows platform and again

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,240
I wanted to say that I'm still learning

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,979
I'm not at all at all means like a

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,259
subject matter expert I'm still learning

40
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,520
on all of this so feel free if you have

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,770
any feedback good and bad as well so

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,170
first off Who am I

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,969
so oh actually all right so it's the

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,369
next slide after that I always like to

45
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,589
put this disclaimer up because number

46
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,780
one it doesn't it makes me not

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,880
responsible if I say anything wrong and

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,220
also at the same time if there's a

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,630
I actually put this today there's this

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,609
is absolutely not a one-size-fits-all

51
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,829
for every environment every industry

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,390
every company we know that security

53
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,880
maturity is different for every

54
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,380
organization every industry depending on

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,600
what time for example vulnerability

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,410
management might be really like a top a

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,880
right now but things change you have

58
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,470
resources you have people you have

59
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,420
assets you have different things so it

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,050
can change anytime also at the same time

61
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,280
it doesn't represent any of the

62
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,400
companies or organizations that I've

63
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,960
worked for and if you're going to if I

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,060
mention any tools you're going to use

65
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,170
this in the ethical legal manner as well

66
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,300
and yeah so there's one I mentioned that

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,790
okay Who am I obviously this is not my

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,270
picture there is actually a website I

69
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,829
was trying to generate kept last night I

70
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,090
always kept kept trying to generate a

71
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,730
picture because every time you go to

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,710
this website this person does not exist

73
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,179
everyone anyone know about this person

74
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,160
does not exist all right cool

75
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,260
I had to keep generating for about I'd

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,650
say 15 minutes until someone had like

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,410
black hair look like me um but I used to

78
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,030
put my images on the web and and busy

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,400
now it's so easy to do like a reverse

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,140
lookup and you're so very easy to find

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,680
out if you have an image like on

82
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,170
LinkedIn

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,040
hopefully it's blurry it's very easy to

84
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,890
find all the websites and links that

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,630
it's attributed to mostly mostly talking

86
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,130
about open source intelligence but we

87
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,799
will talk about that later but this

88
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,560
person does not exist website goes

89
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,180
through it uses artificial intelligence

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,800
none of the pictures it uses different

91
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,890
characteristics of information of people

92
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,209
and it creates different people you can

93
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,079
probably use it on your LinkedIn as well

94
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,820
anyway healthcare professional i former

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,590
adjunct faculty at Brandeis for over 10

96
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,630
plus years I created the healthcare

97
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,820
informatics course at Brandeis I put

98
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,030
security healthcare bridge security the

99
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:10,090
second class so I taught a lot of

100
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,240
healthcare professionals like medical

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,310
officers yeah healthcare nurses doctors

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,290
as well and people that wanted to

103
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,820
transition into healthcare as well so

104
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,520
healthcare really needs your help we

105
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,400
need more people also at the same time I

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,109

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,430
agenda we're gonna be talking about blue

147
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
teaming what you need to do we're gonna

148
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,160
have some recommendations and then

149
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,919
hopefully I get through all the slides

150
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,280
so that there are questions I can answer

151
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,469
your questions do so here pretty much

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,030
you see that blue team I think everyone

153
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,860
has says for those of you on blue

154
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,929
teaming and also for those of you and

155
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,300
difference other teams as well we've

156
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,389
heard that blue teaming you always have

157
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,729
to be 100% correct at the time so for

158
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,970
example the the red team the people that

159
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:36,370
do it to simulate the attackers the

160
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:39,070
cyber criminals basically they you know

161
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,389
they basic and can be they don't always

162
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,810
have to be right hundred percent

163
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,759
so as you know the term originally came

164
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,699
out from the military so the military

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,189
wanted to use use this term blue team

166
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:53,889
it's kind of a way of acting as the

167
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:57,099
friendly foe you know defense and then

168
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,169
they also came up with this red team as

169
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,969
well and it's basic os-- playing the

170
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:04,180
role of adversary offense replicating

171
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:07,240
attackers but in a nutshell blue team is

172
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,539
looking at discovering defending against

173
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,189
attacks and I also added another one

174
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,259
late last night it was actually a

175
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,659
sharing information as well so for

176
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,759
example the cyber criminals the the

177
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:20,710
attackers they share information really

178
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,620
well you know whether it be like you

179
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,388
know whatever mechanism they use so for

180
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,219
blue teamers we need to really share

181
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,199
information better as well obviously

182
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,509
think some things are private or

183
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
confidential to your group or your

184
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,979
department or your company but there are

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
also other ones that can help blue

186
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,889
teamers as well so we need to share more

187
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,529
information more readily as well so so

188
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,150
who loves using cheat sheets who loves

189
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:49,210
using cheats so a show of hands okay

190
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,729
great excellent so I really love she

191
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,560
cheats i I actually initially found out

192
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:56,050
from like sans and ever since I've been

193
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,379
using cheat sheets for everything so for

194
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,289
example when you're looking at let's say

195
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,360
one of the most used most commands on

196
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:07,449
Windows command line for example or a

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,569
Linux command or some other command line

198
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,009
there's great cheat sheets available the

199
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,650
one that I actually recommend is this

200
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,360
malware archaea archaeology how many

201
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,179
people know about that one it actually

202
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,419
talks about all the different different

203
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,919
windows different windows commands it's

204
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,330
actually agree great information here

205
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,960
but again I'll be sharing all these

206
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,719
slides too

207
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,960
there's also stuff from sans especially

208
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:34,269
on the data forensics side DF ir there's

209
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,458
also pen testing sans as well there's of

210
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,169
course I already mentioned there there's

211
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,419
certain training she cheats as well all

212
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,828
these are made available and I encourage

213
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,419
everyone to use cheat sheets because

214
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:46,060
when you when you think of an incident

215
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,050
or when you think of some disaster or

216
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,849
events or suspicious events basically

217
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,719
sometimes you don't have time to kind of

218
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,570
the

219
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,420
it takes just a small amount of time to

220
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,340
make a decision and these cheat sheets

221
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,670
are away again this is just my opinion

222
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,320
but our way of not making a mistake so

223
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,740
you can just follow this it could be a

224
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,870
procedure it doesn't have to be a cheat

225
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,480
sheet but these are procedures that you

226
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,370
and your group can use and you and your

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,840
group can work with other team members

228
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,180
as well so it's just kind of like

229
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,350
repetition practice as well so this is

230
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,109
why I mentioned not cheat sheets so

231
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,080
first of all in your organization's in

232
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,790
your network environment show of hands

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,280
do you know what is normal in your

234
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,160
environment you know what is normal this

235
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,650
is in terms of what are what specific

236
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,600
workstation processes should be running

237
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,310
on a finance computer what specific

238
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,280
workstation processes program software

239
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,800
should be running on a I don't know

240
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,560
yes 400 I don't know what what's

241
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,540
specific thing um so how do you tell

242
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,280
what is normal if you don't know what is

243
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,839
that I'm sorry how do you tell what is

244
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,360
that normal if you don't know what is

245
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,400
normal in your organizations obviously

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,690
there's different challenges I'm not

247
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,459
just talking about internal

248
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,110
infrastructure it's all these cloud

249
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,080
third-party infrastructures as well

250
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,460
remember that doesn't matter if your

251
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,970
organization is in the cloud

252
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:16,610
AWS office 365 Microsoft's we're

253
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,310
responsible ultimately where their

254
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,930
company is responsible for the data

255
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,709
doesn't matter where it is

256
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,390
so you'll see but you really want to

257
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,850
know what is normal to be able to know

258
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,380
what is normal you need to to be able to

259
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,440
know what is that normal

260
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,660
you need to know what is what is normal

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,820
basically so I encourage you to take a

262
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,650
look at that and again right which one

263
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:44,030
is normal I was also looking for a

264
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,010
picture that actually designated I

265
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,680
remember was I posted on Twitter a

266
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,600
couple years maybe months ago but I

267
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,810
couldn't really find one but for example

268
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,160
here what is which one is normal you on

269
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,189
the left hand side you can see that

270
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,650
Explorer Windows Explorer when that

271
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,300
process basically runs as user in it

272
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,000
spawns Explorer let's look at the

273
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,859
Explorer process it does all of this the

274
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,110
registry key as well

275
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,420
this is just some examples for example

276
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,820
like one of the things you probably want

277
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,010
to do is like a golden image which which

278
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,020
I will talk in the next few slides but

279
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,000
you really want to know what are the

280
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,790
exact process is running let's say on a

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,100
financial computer a computer in finance

282
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,560
or accounting computer or a IT computer

283
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,960
or etc that's how that's how you're able

284
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,369
to tell what is abnormal basically so

285
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,390
okay know thy network

286
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,580
I think everyone already knows about

287
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,400
this but these are the different things

288
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,650
that that blue teamers should be

289
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,020
monitoring or people as defenders as

290
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,790
well we really want to take a look at

291
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,579
all the high privilege low security

292
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,439
accounts so for example these are like

293
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,630
the domain administrator accounts these

294
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,280
are the OU 365 Chloe administrator these

295
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,950
are as the other ones usually their

296
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,530
service accounts that passwords never

297
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,820
expire sometimes there's actually I

298
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,010
should say most of the time there's low

299
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,920
security on it when was the last time

300
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,319
there there's an application or API tied

301
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,300
into it that basically changes maybe

302
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,580
changes the password or it takes a look

303
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,890
at the auditing rules for the high

304
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,510
security accounts and this this I'm

305
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,270
talking about just anything in Active

306
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,310
Directory domain administrator do so for

307
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,710
example Shawn Metcalfe one of the guys

308
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,800
who I really admire he's awesome he's

309
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,330
amazing he and his team do we need

310
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,479
domain administrators for these

311
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,130
different accounts I don't know I don't

312
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,770
think so you have to really take a look

313
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,930
as well also at the same time please

314
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,000
please please monitor your network or

315
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,829
else the attackers criminals will

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,570
monitor your network for you as well

317
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,950
I'll give you a story about that in the

318
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,770
next in a couple minutes

319
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,870
system administrators doesn't matter

320
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,970
system is raters IT people that are

321
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,280
taking care of their infrastructure we

322
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,140
need to do a better job of taking taking

323
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,880
look at monitoring reviewing logs as

324
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,280
well what do we do after that obviously

325
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,050
there's a lot of logs how do you how do

326
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,030
you parse it how do you automate it how

327
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,640
do you you know take care of it as well

328
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,350
you can't take care of everything a lot

329
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,960
of times the criminals cyber attackers

330
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,060
they will inundate kind of do a denial

331
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,600
of service put you know date for example

332
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,579
they try to look at all the different

333
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,510
logging infrastructure and they actually

334
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,940
purposely

335
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,100
try to fill up your locks for example so

336
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,990
that for example your logs logging

337
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,430
infrastructure no longer can you can

338
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,290
actually find the right right stuff

339
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,060
anymore we can talk about that later but

340
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:34,310
I just want to mention that deception

341
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,599
technology honey pots how many people

342
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,660
are using honey pots in their

343
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,510
infrastructure it's still a really great

344
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,019
technology and it's still it's what

345
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,970
we'll talk more about that too okay so

346
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,699
go to images

347
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,949
who knows about Center for Internet

348
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:55,729
Security it's a great resource for

349
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:58,099
different golden images I believe that

350
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,860
to be able to know what's normal and

351
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,230
what's abnormal you need to have like a

352
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,880
some kind of golden image right now

353
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,130
there's a lot of different things based

354
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,110
on let's say you have a golden image for

355
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,589
IT a good image for Finance golden image

356
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,320
for etc you control it it doesn't change

357
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:17,089
let's say when things need to be changed

358
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,070
it's check for vulnerabilities and then

359
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,199
you can also update it gradually as well

360
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,519
with tests as well because a new coded

361
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,959
image may not work with every new

362
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,360
application or operating system

363
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,089
third-party etc so I really recommend

364
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,829
taking a look at cinder Center for

365
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,350
Internet Security provides a lot of

366
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,290
different benchmarks um many years ago I

367
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,699
used to be part of like the windows

368
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:41,360
wow-wow back I think was Rick windows XP

369
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:42,500
or something BC is benchmarks talk about

370
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,779
all the difference

371
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,430
hardening what you should do for Cisco

372
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,920
aasa firewalls what you should do for

373
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,138
Windows what you should do for any

374
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,610
specific technology mobile phones as

375
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:57,290
well iOS Android there's also I'm trying

376
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,740
to think of there's these different

377
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,449
these are all free free as well this try

378
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,019
this in a lab environment don't do it in

379
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:07,849
your real environment these RC is really

380
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,500
locked down images but you can check you

381
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,870
can take a look at it maybe you can use

382
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,670
you leverage some of those images take a

383
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,670
look at the group policy that's built in

384
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,519
and try to maybe copy all that too but

385
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:23,209
again it's not a one-size-fits-all - so

386
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,760
I just wanted to mention that Windows

387
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:28,339
sandbox how many people know about the

388
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,279
in April 2000 nineteen there was a new

389
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,860
Windows sandbox Microsoft patch I I

390
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,500
encourage you to also take a look at

391
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,480
her soft sandbox sandbox see how many

392
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,250
people know about that - there's a new

393
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,260
one it's actually kitch is compatible

394
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,940
with Windows 10 now that I use when

395
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,399
analyzing like phishing emails or

396
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,860
something else - but yeah Windows

397
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,470
sandbox is great you can download it

398
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,930
right right directly from Microsoft as

399
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:01,850
well so cool all right how many people

400
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:04,250
know about how many people know about

401
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,829
the ice axe information sharing analysis

402
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,500
centers okay every one of you should

403
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:11,870
should really be participating in their

404
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,180
webinars and also presenting if you can

405
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,880
it's a great experience there's one for

406
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,250
every United States has many information

407
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,910
ice axe as well for different industries

408
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,980
healthcare automotive SCADA you name it

409
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,329
there's so many ice axe as well and

410
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,730
again they're all about sharing

411
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,199
information whether it be overly it's

412
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,360
not confidential but it helps to blue

413
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,769
teamers and helps everyone as a whole so

414
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,440
I encourage everyone to take a look at

415
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,899
it there's more information there's also

416
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,500
Isaac's around the world too but take a

417
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,180
look at that - all right event logs so I

418
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,610
think everyone knows event event logs

419
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:50,870
one way to get to event log is actually

420
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,850
using the events vwr commands through

421
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,709
command line or you can actually

422
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,350
initiate this - or you can go through

423
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,630
the GUI as well um what I really

424
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,260
recommend here is that we should

425
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:05,480
actually be ingesting logs that are not

426
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,520
only servers but also on the work

427
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,339
stations as well so for example a

428
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,959
question for the for the red teamers

429
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,109
when was the last time that you did a

430
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,929
pen test then actually you you took over

431
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,399
tried to take the logs of the server

432
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,010
most of the time the red teamers will

433
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,809
and correct me if I'm wrong but the red

434
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,809
teamers will actually do let's say they

435
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,639
do some kind of I don't know take

436
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,049
something and then they will always try

437
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,559
to get stuff from the endpoint

438
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,840
workstation logs it's most of the time a

439
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,940
lot of companies they only have the

440
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,549
server logs they don't have any endpoint

441
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,800
logs so take a look at that did anyone

442
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,790
want to comment about red red teamers I

443
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,629
know that to try to stay under the gun

444
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,970
you you're not gonna

445
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,820
go to the servers because and again this

446
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,470
is not like 100 percent correct but

447
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,300
they're not going to go to the servers

448
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,700
because the servers have a lot of

449
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,190
different security controls and that you

450
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,980
know like traps around it so why not go

451
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,140
to something that is not being used or

452
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,790
not being highly monitored so it's good

453
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,000
it would be the endpoints as well so I

454
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,490
just wanted to mention that

455
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,340
okay so regarding log review log

456
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,930
analyzation as well obviously we want to

457
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,639
take a look at a privileged user in

458
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,320
account mod monitoring all the domain

459
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,990
administrator accounts all the office

460
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,149
365 go administrators anything that's

461
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,540
basically hired and user did anyone know

462
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,990
that um is this true and false by

463
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,300
default in Active Directory a regular

464
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,000
user can read everything in Active

465
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,960
Directory is that true or false true

466
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,450
excellent excellent

467
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
yep so just so you know anyone that has

468
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,090
read read access in Active Directory can

469
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,770
read anything so so they can kind of

470
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,360
spawn Active Directory users groups they

471
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,010
can start reading stuff stuff you should

472
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,229
have group policies around that but

473
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,580
we'll talk about that later

474
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,840
abnormal external communication sharing

475
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,970
I already talked about like you know

476
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,740
what what to find out what is normal

477
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,870
what to find out versus what is abnormal

478
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,520
as well you can only know what is

479
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,550
abnormal when you know things are normal

480
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,220
as well taking a look at acceptable use

481
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,750
policies validations not only just the

482
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,780
insider threat remember it's not just

483
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,290
the external external cybercriminals -

484
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:20,990
it's the internal internal insiders as

485
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,639
well data exfiltration unusual port

486
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,830
activity I think we get allowed that

487
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,220
information from the different firewall

488
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,600
switches Network information - but you

489
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,760
also want to take a look at the

490
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,500
east-west traffic as well take a look at

491
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,270
that so for example if you don't have

492
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,590
the right logs in there how are you how

493
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,480
are you able to actually see what

494
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,750
happened as well between your third

495
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,160
parties or some other connection etc

496
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,830
file integrity monitoring obviously we

497
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,620
want to know right um we've seen it that

498
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,570
wanna cry when akairo wanna cry one want

499
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,330
to cry to SMB vulnerabilities basically

500
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,149
you really want to take a look at put

501
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,189
stuff around your SMB shares as well

502
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,680
auditing remember auditing is not turned

503
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,730
on by default I mean in in Windows you

504
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,860
have to turn

505
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,580
as well in that group policy or the

506
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,189
security policy as well right so okay

507
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,590
anyone know what is Windows Event ID for

508
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,120
688 you would just get bragging rights I

509
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:19,610
don't have any prizes yes yeah exactly

510
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,739
perfect yeah great creature yep so it's

511
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:25,850
a busy any new process spawning yep so

512
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,740
you don't have to know for those of you

513
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,510
people that didn't know I think that if

514
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,280
you have like a cheat sheet or if you

515
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,200
have the req highly most highly

516
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,879
recommended top security events that we

517
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,070
should be looking at I have it in the

518
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,230
next few slides but four six is eight is

519
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,510
basically any time a new process is is

520
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,850
planning is it could be anything and for

521
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,760
example so I have to keep going there it

522
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:49,428
could be anything like this w script

523
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,500
running this is something great to

524
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,720
monitor especially in you're logging

525
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,490
infrastructure could be a sim could be a

526
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,190
log infrastructure but I'll show you

527
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,170
more in in the next few slides - all

528
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,200
right these are more security event logs

529
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:06,679
so for example for six to five failed

530
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,130
user logins those are for brute forces

531
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,200
so anytime there is additional let's say

532
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,860
people either entering the wrong

533
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,690
password many times or you probably want

534
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,850
to monitor against that you know for

535
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,860
your in your security operation center

536
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,080
you probably want to take a look at

537
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,370
those events let's say Rob brute force

538
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,320
they could print it could be false

539
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,689
positive it doesn't have to be but we've

540
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,360
seen a lot especially around domain

541
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,800
controller no entry domain administrator

542
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,600
accounts and other accounts that people

543
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,050
don't really normally don't take a look

544
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,959
at as well all right lateral movements

545
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,030
for 6to4 basically it's more of um

546
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,750
anytime like account has successfully

547
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:49,460
logged in right for 64's anytime account

548
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,770
has successfully logged in is on other

549
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,660
grades could this is probably about

550
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,820
fifty fifty percent but you can detect

551
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,980
some kind of lateral movement so between

552
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,280
four six two four a new processes one

553
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,830
and in between four six two five four

554
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,360
six two four four sixty five account is

555
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,809
successfully logged in as well so you

556
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,928
can put some defenses around that these

557
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,760
are some additional application stuff -

558
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:16,370
in your sim in your logging you can also

559
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,860
kind of monitor around this - it won't

560
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,719
be exact but the more you do it the more

561
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,389
you know as well but it will help as

562
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,710
well regard any application and crashes

563
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,080
- all right

564
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,670
this is I mentioned about the auditing

565
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,040
policy remember remember you have to

566
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,310
turn it on to actually see these logs as

567
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,928
well but it depends but you you probably

568
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:38,330
want to kind of like test it out and see

569
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,490
if what happens but something like this

570
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,050
the event log being cleared I think that

571
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,210
would be really interesting as well or

572
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,159
maybe you want to build your defense

573
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,720
around if someone actually shuts down

574
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,010
your Active Directory Active Directory

575
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,900
your whole Active Directory system

576
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,190
guess what happens then you don't have

577
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,990
any vlogs you don't have anything right

578
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,520
or they clear anything but there's

579
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,240
there's many things here but you should

580
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,429
build your defenses around that - okay

581
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,140
firewall logs right I think firewall

582
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:08,290
logs this gets good it does a good job

583
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,490
internally as well might block some

584
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,950
official like server stuff going

585
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,290
outbound as well but you also want to

586
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,240
build defenses and and notifications

587
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,920
around maybe some firewalls

588
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,570
firewall rules arguing it may be

589
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,320
something else etc group policies

590
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,090
obviously we want to take a look at

591
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,560
remember I mentioned about the the you

592
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,790
know putting putting together two

593
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,220
different auditing logs putting together

594
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,540
that you want to turn stuff on for

595
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,240
example if you take a look at the event

596
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,040
log I believe that if by default the

597
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,690
event log is about I don't know not even

598
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,060
like 16 Meg I think it's like less than

599
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,040
5 Meg or something by defaults you can

600
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,470
actually turn use group policy to turn

601
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,730
on that these different blog sizes and

602
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,040
then actually monitor them

603
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,020
I'm not saying to monitor everything you

604
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,350
want to monitor based on probably the

605
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,330
event ID as well or else there's gonna

606
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,918
be a whole influx of locks coming in and

607
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,699
you won't know what to do with it so

608
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:06,470
just wanted to mention there all right

609
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,970
application advanced audit policies on

610
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,309
file shares this is what I mentioned

611
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,510
about like the wanna cry SMB different

612
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,168
things we want to actually take a look

613
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,390
at all the different

614
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:19,400
SMB sharing as well some some of you

615
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,490
might already be doing it with DLP

616
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,500
policies etc DLP policies is not it's

617
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,330
there's a lot of false positive in there

618
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,040
too but you want to actually take a look

619
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,230
at you know what maybe

620
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,210
things things that are being shared or

621
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:36,260
things etc just getting more detail

622
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,210
around that right event ID five one four

623
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,670
five I'm not going to ask but it's

624
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,470
basically you know a network State share

625
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,240
object was added so let's say someone

626
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,700
shares something on them on the file

627
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,350
share internally as well as you get

628
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,030
something like that with auditing turned

629
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:55,010
on all right so okay cool all right good

630
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm going good okay great I'm on 26th

631
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:06,320
great great halfway okay so any

632
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:08,360
questions so far yes yes yep these are

633
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,230
all these are all Microsoft Windows

634
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:24,949
Event log so yep

635
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:26,540
yep exactly yep yep yep so the question

636
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,300
was if you have a third party

637
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,129
application and you want to ingest in

638
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:36,169
the third party application windows logs

639
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,950
yes yes yep this is all Microsoft yep

640
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,350
yep exactly

641
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,500
yep yeah great great question any other

642
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,020
questions so far okay great excellent

643
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,000
excellent so how many people are

644
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,010
ingesting logs and of course using

645
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,870
different open source utilities on and

646
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,910
in their environment right as well it

647
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,370
writing can be a combination of

648
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:59,480
commercial tools open source tools these

649
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:02,209
are some that I've I've used in the in a

650
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,400
couple of couple years ago snare there's

651
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,010
some so what I'm trying to say is that

652
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,600
all of this is all like free stuff

653
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,760
unless the company has that changed it

654
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,409
everything in my slide is all free it's

655
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,770
all free actually it's all available to

656
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,810
everyone anyone can download it there's

657
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,240
n X log how many people use it it's a

658
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,550
free one you can ingest logs their snare

659
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,820
there's many other ones too I just put

660
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:28,629
these two together many like security

661
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:32,750
operation center they use different

662
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:34,580
different utilities as well to to in in

663
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,320
their logging environment or sim as well

664
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,570
but you you want to have some kind of

665
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,960
gesture as well so just wanted mentioned

666
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,210
there all right here I didn't have time

667
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,879
but how many people have used bloodhound

668
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,029
in Active Directory as a test it's not

669
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:51,110
an end-all be-all a lot of penetrations

670
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:54,529
testing companies use it when they do

671
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,168
Active Directory when they do Active

672
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:59,659
Directory when they do an Active

673
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:01,129
Directory penetration tests as well but

674
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,559
it's a great idea to put in at test

675
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:06,080
environments maybe not in your corporate

676
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,700
but you know maybe my take a look at it

677
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,519
it's actually really interesting I'm

678
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,070
actually about to take a look at it too

679
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,809
right um so this is actually all free as

680
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,240
well how many people have heard of

681
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:22,149
elastic yeah okay it's called yeah okay

682
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:24,590
right so um these are kind of a basic

683
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,629
recommendations around logging obviously

684
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,990
you want to include a time stamp stamp

685
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:31,879
you want to have format in JSON I'm not

686
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,999
gonna read all this but you want to turn

687
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:37,428
on logging you want to log stuff but on

688
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:39,559
the left hand side is elastic you okay I

689
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,740
recommend it there's this is typically

690
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,779
on the left hand side for like a smaller

691
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,299
organization basically but there's a

692
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:50,869
these are all free beats is a data

693
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:53,929
collection log stash is very similar to

694
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:55,908
like a logging ingestion as well elastic

695
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:57,830
search is kind of like the eok engine I

696
00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:00,649
mean last sick you'll probably hear

697
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:02,539
elastic elastic comm gabbana is kind of

698
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:05,508
like putting together the visual

699
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:07,940
endpoints together so this this again

700
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:09,470
you feel free to use it or not but it's

701
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,409
really interesting actually show you in

702
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,169
the next few slides so for example an

703
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:17,240
elastic search eok it's actually being

704
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,440
used and know if you yeah you know it's

705
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,389
actually being used by companies like

706
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:24,860
uber Netflix Facebook Microsoft etc you

707
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:28,399
what you can do is actually on the left

708
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,949
hand side you actually can you actually

709
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,168
can if you take a look when you ingest

710
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,389
all these logs it could be like beats

711
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,580
using beats it could be any kind of open

712
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:39,649
source or commercial tool ingesting the

713
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,320
logs you bring it in and then from here

714
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:45,768
it's kind of like think of this as like

715
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,269
a a logging kind of like a logging maybe

716
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,100
not a sim because it could do a

717
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,289
correlation too but you're sure it's

718
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,939
it's very similar to like a Splunk how

719
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,919
many people have used plunk right yeah

720
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,789
okay cool this is very similar it's open

721
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,739
source you

722
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:00,950
can actually run queries on different

723
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:02,809
event IDs you can run that it could be

724
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,729
all our windows event ideas could be

725
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,799
anything that you want to search for it

726
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:08,299
can be like an something unfortunate I

727
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,609
didn't have time to put all the

728
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:12,619
different queries but if you don't have

729
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,720
anything in your environment let's say

730
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,580
or let's say it doesn't work as well

731
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,090
there's many open source alternatives as

732
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,399
to - but also you can also the company

733
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,559
um you can also purchase the commercial

734
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,418
version too but it's a great tool

735
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,309
because you have all the event you have

736
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:29,929
all the logs you have all the events so

737
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,090
what do you do with it now you actually

738
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:34,190
do you actually go through and put

739
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,439
different searches may be automated

740
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,299
searches may be correlated searches as

741
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,399
well and that's how you can actually go

742
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:45,229
in and actually see what's going on as

743
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,209
well re cabana was the visualization for

744
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:50,749
you okay so it kind of makes the nice

745
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,399
graphic Maps visualization as well could

746
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:54,559
be could be for the leadership team for

747
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,279
example could be for something but

748
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,440
pretty pretty interesting there alright

749
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,210
some passwords how many people are doing

750
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,710
different monthly password audits in

751
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,889
your company you don't the raise your

752
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,499
hand it's okay yeah it's it's um I think

753
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:12,789
that now you know for those of you let

754
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:15,559
me ask for those of you on on red team's

755
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:18,649
right how many times when you're trying

756
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:20,629
to get into a company's network that you

757
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,849
actually take a look at look at all the

758
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:25,399
password hashes looking at LinkedIn

759
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:27,080
looking at Facebook looking in that all

760
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,649
the different breaches comparing it to

761
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:32,119
see if any of those people you're on any

762
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:33,738
of the people in the rotation have the

763
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,629
same hash what does that mean they have

764
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:37,549
the same password right hopefully

765
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:40,039
there's using theirs to FA or

766
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,379
multi-factor authentication hash cat how

767
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,239
many people have used hash cat I've used

768
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:46,279
it yeah actually a lot it's awesome

769
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:48,289
there's different attack modes there's

770
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,460
five attack modes you can combine it

771
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,499
there's a straight attack there's

772
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,259
combination attack we can put a left and

773
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:56,479
right joint there's also like dictionary

774
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:58,309
attacks which works okay only ER there's

775
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,929
also brute force permutation I really

776
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:01,639
recommend everyone take a look at it on

777
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:05,840
the left hand side actually talks about

778
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,849
all the different hashes in hash can and

779
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,169
what to use for example NT om is

780
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,659
actually sorry

781
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,940
over there I think it's like a 1111 down

782
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,530
I forget what the number is if anyone

783
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,990
knows let me know but I think it's like

784
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,730
eleven thousand or something bomb by

785
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,130
default when you are actually doing like

786
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,020
using hash cat you can actually sum you

787
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,510
can have it either automatically try to

788
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,000
find out what kind of hash you got it

789
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,650
from or you can actually specify so I

790
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,600
really recommend you take a look at hash

791
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,270
cat and you know probably one of the

792
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:39,260
things as long again number one yet yet

793
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,550
yet approval for this to write you we

794
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,900
don't want to happen we don't want to

795
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:44,120
have that in sense of where like

796
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,240
remember that goes penetrate penetration

797
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,760
testers from coal fire fire they got

798
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,680
into a little bit of a thing right so

799
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,680
but make sure you get approval for all

800
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,990
this um but I recommend everyone take a

801
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,000
look at it because one of the things

802
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,750
that red teamers do is actually they

803
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,400
compare the they're gonna get LinkedIn

804
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,130
password hashes they're going to get the

805
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,300
Facebook badges breach information

806
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,190
they're going to get all the information

807
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,440
and try to compare it with the users as

808
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,300
well alright

809
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,400
Kerberos Singh how many people know

810
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,840
Kerberos thing all right I just learned

811
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,840
about it actually earlier this year

812
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,680
strong Metcalfe does has great

813
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,360
information Ben 10 as well basically

814
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,610
it's a method for extracting service

815
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,919
accounts credentials from Active

816
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,050
Directory with a regular accounts most

817
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,840
service accounts we know never expire

818
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:38,990
pastors never expired there's really not

819
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,340
a lot of controls around it and any user

820
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,680
authenticate and Active Directory can

821
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,959
query remember because I mentioned

822
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,210
doesn't anyone who has Active Directory

823
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,790
account user account can read anything

824
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,660
in in Active Directory that's crazy

825
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:53,389
right um

826
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,770
there's some stuff from Ben 10 he was my

827
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,260
instructor for one of these other

828
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,750
classes and he did an awesome job on a

829
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,379
Kerberos thing as well there's Sean

830
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,490
Metcalfe a pyro tech 3 talks about Tom

831
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,710
basically talks about this Kerberos

832
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,480
thing as well arm joy right probably

833
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,980
some of you also write a lot of you

834
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,140
heard of them he's also one of the

835
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,080
creators of bloodhound as well so

836
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:19,160
Kerberos Singh revisited this one talks

837
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,960
about SP n SP ends as well you can you

838
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,640
can actually look for service principal

839
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,430
names as well there's some tools there

840
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,140
take a look at that all right Windows

841
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,450
system internal so many people use that

842
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,030
right this this guy right here mark

843
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,090
russinovich now he's the CTO of the

844
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,320
Microsoft Azure I really recommend

845
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,090
taking a look at this especially when

846
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,429
you're doing your thread hunting or or

847
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,879
even if not and I'll talk about thread

848
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:45,200
hunting too in the next few slides later

849
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,770
sysinternals tools are great they're

850
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,540
free he created it back in 1996 but it's

851
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,780
awesome especially system on process

852
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:56,210
Explorer PSA Zack Portman Rahman process

853
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,440
monitor list EO else this is just a few

854
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,380
there's like valve I get out there's

855
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,540
many tools but this is awesome use it

856
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,280
take a look at it this will help to

857
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,170
identify what is should be on your

858
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,120
network what should not be what is

859
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,040
abnormal what is normal as well so I

860
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,109
just wanted to mention that there's also

861
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,850
sorry there's also a live internals as

862
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,260
well sysinternals for those of you that

863
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,089
want don't want to download you can run

864
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:24,950
it from the website it has Internet

865
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:28,790
connectivity yes yes yep exactly

866
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:30,168
yep these are all things and yep yep

867
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,360
exactly exactly

868
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,980
yep and who who knows this person

869
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,510
Jessica Payne she is one of the

870
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,840
Microsoft security researchers who I

871
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,669
hope I can be one day she's awesome she

872
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,830
basically does security research and

873
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:45,319
also she does a lot of stuff for

874
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,690
Microsoft security and she has a lot of

875
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,520
blogs a lot of things like you can use

876
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,590
open source stuff you can use for

877
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,710
example power bi power business

878
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:57,230
intelligence that basically is the it

879
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,000
requires a license in office 365 you can

880
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,560
run it to look at different event logs

881
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,170
for example so you don't have to use

882
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,020
elasticy ok you can use anything that

883
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:08,120
you want as long as it works but she's

884
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,130
awesome she talks about lateral movement

885
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,890
free tools recommendations and she's

886
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,470
pretty much like I know I wish I had a

887
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,529
kms slash ROI but she has right there

888
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,759
but she's awesome take a look at that

889
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,000
and she has a lot of stuff around

890
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,830
lateral movements and Microsoft as well

891
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,900
alright so now it's all about to

892
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:30,290
patching about patching and finding

893
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,970
vulnerabilities obviously there's maybe

894
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,650
there's different departments or

895
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,020
different companies may not do a good

896
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,940
job around it but still patching is

897
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,710
definitely if there's one thing in the

898
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,400
company that you can do that doesn't

899
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:45,200
require a lot of additional money maybe

900
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,480
it depends depends on your patches as

901
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,189
well its patching I don't think about

902
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,750
patching the operating system but also

903
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,360
all the third-party vulnerabilities

904
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,250
third-party software as well take a look

905
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,100
at the vulnerability management whether

906
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,230
it be a necessary install or a

907
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,690
commercial tool - there's a lot of cloud

908
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,030
solutions now software as-a-service

909
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:07,640
repeat and do over again as I mentioned

910
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,110
your vulnerability let's say if you take

911
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,290
your your at leadership and you're

912
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:14,270
trying to show the leadership that your

913
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:17,420
vulnerability is actually at a right now

914
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,710
during the month of November one of the

915
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,230
things that I do is actually to that

916
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,590
leadership know that our a our great a

917
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,380
won't be great a in December would beard

918
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,840
there's different things yeah so so it's

919
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,400
it changes over time it's never going to

920
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,700
be always the same it could be even

921
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,230
worse some some ones as well resolve it

922
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,089
and there's some information here

923
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,780
open-source security tools that you can

924
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,940
get to all right PowerShell how many

925
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,480
people use PowerShell awesome right all

926
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,000
right great

927
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,560
you should we should be using it more at

928
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,240
you know one of the things that the

929
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,310
cyber criminals like to do is they like

930
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,470
to use PowerShell because it's free and

931
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,690
it's open it's on every Windows 10 box

932
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,730
now Windows 7 you had to install it

933
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,710
Windows XP I don't think I don't even

934
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,920
know if it works I think I think you

935
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:06,440
have to install it too but use it I was

936
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,470
created by this guy Jeffrey snoer in

937
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,060
2016 he's now the chief architects of

938
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,470
yeah whereas actually he's a technical

939
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,600
fellow actually the highest level and

940
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,759
Microsoft and is built on the net

941
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,980
framework I advise you to take a look at

942
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,260
this if you haven't it's kind of like

943
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,150
the new command-line everything in

944
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,590
Microsoft now doesn't have to be done in

945
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:29,590
GUI it can all be done in PowerShell

946
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:31,970
from exchange to Active Directory to

947
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,950
exchange email groups that you can do

948
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:37,250
sometimes in the newer you know on sites

949
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:39,230
exchange or office 365 it's hidden so I

950
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,350
really recommends taking a look at

951
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,420
PowerShell as well all right and map I

952
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,770
think everyone knows nmap it was in the

953
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,549
hackers movies and all these different

954
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:52,369
ones is in the mr. robot it was actually

955
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:54,979
- right from David Kennedy or the Trevor

956
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:57,799
thing and Matt dork Gordon for your door

957
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:59,899
he's awesome take a look at that you can

958
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:02,749
do not only looking for open ports you

959
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:04,578
can do advanced I end map stop - you can

960
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,769
look at looking for some vulnerabilities

961
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,539
- looking for additional stuff - I

962
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:09,019
didn't put it in there but a lot of good

963
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,929
stuff there

964
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:13,249
all right polar bear honey pots this is

965
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:15,409
actually talking about honey pots and

966
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:17,198
honey pot right is just a trap for an

967
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:20,239
attacker hoping that they will interact

968
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,579
with a way that provides useful

969
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,709
intelligence polar bear was actually

970
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,269
from Benton it's currently in the making

971
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:28,609
right now but what it is it's the

972
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:30,499
premise of um you can create any

973
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:33,799
application let's say like command line

974
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:35,779
or PowerShell and then basically it will

975
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:37,788
trick the attacker or cyber criminals

976
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:39,769
into thinking that's a real command line

977
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:41,809
so it's kind of like looping looping and

978
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:44,359
polar bears one of is actually coming

979
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:45,919
from Benton in a few months as well and

980
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,299
you're welcome to add stuff to it it's

981
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:48,379
gonna be different applications it's

982
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,969
kind of like a honey pot of different

983
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,890
applications it could be a PowerShell

984
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,899
give anything then you kind of laugh at

users Fisher's users I'm not gonna ask

997
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:24,589
them obviously but right if you don't

998
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,209
fish your users guess what your cyber

999
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:28,219
criminals well they're gonna be your

1000

your best users friends if you don't

1001
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:33,499
you're not aware of it right talk to

1002
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,899
your users don't assume please don't

1003
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:37,308
have the mentality that users don't know

1004
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:41,569
what they're doing they're very smart

1005
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:43,039
just because users don't don't indulge

1006
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:46,099
and security doesn't mean that they do

1007
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,589
and they do not care as well and help

1008
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:50,329
them help them try to figure out what

1009
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,669
they're trying to do you know it should

1010
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,139
be an ambassador for them and don't give

1011
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:56,509
up on them because it's our it's our

1012
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:57,979
jobs there's some information here how

1013
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:59,959
many people remember using social

1014
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:02,899
engineer toolkit works pretty well you

1015
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:05,629
can copy any website in like one minute

1016
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,040
it's just like like they write very

1017
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:11,150
interesting it was from trusted tech

1018
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,920
David Kennedy as well the there's a most

1019
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,000
of the versions of SCT has been released

1020
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,130
but except for one

1021
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,850
so the antivirus won't catch it as well

1022
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:22,130
but um good information there so all

1023
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,410
right threat hunting a threat hunting

1024
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,540
there's some good information here but

1025
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,920
pretty much in a nutshell threat hunting

1026
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,600
is depending on the maturity of

1027
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,460
realization you really want to do for

1028
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,180
hunting there's no specific framework

1029
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,060
for it

1030
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,980
but you basically one of the things that

1031
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:41,360
threat hunting gives you is basically a

1032
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,940
way to number one most of the time most

1033
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,620
organizations have like a ids/ips they

1034
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,130
usually have rules base stuff they

1035
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:51,680
usually have like maybe a enter PPR yeah

1036
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:54,380
next generation antivirus for example

1037
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,640
but remember it's all signature based it

1038
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,980
doesn't have to be signature based could

1039
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,990
be behavioral based as well or we

1040
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,990
actually we really need to do throughout

1041
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,689
hunting more because the human human

1042
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,879
remember a human factor as well the

1043
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:11,600
human will actually find the that

1044
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,300
obstacles the stuff that signatures and

1045
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,279
this non non may be behavioral will

1046
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,450
finds as well do you because for example

1047
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,180
um um yeah we like for example I give

1048
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,290
you example there was accident where we

1049
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,779
were doing threat hunting and all of a

1050
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:28,550
sudden we found some users from China by

1051
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,010
accident yeah I think so that's a good

1052
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,240
keep keep working on that is the lessons

1053
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,130
learned but it helps everyone to

1054
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,470
remember keep in mind we can have all

1055
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,000
the technology and in we can have all

1056
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,270
the technology in place but companies

1057
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,710
still get me get breach get hacked right

1058
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,840
we need to leverage more of it we need

1059
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,630
to do more automation we need to also oh

1060
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,760
this one is I'm sorry this one is a

1061
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:53,030
PowerShell script ps1 it's called it

1062
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,760
blue deep blue it actually it's actually

1063
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,350
from sans and basically you can run logs

1064
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,300
through it and it will give you more

1065
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:02,779
information as well so there's some

1066
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,180
stuff there I hooked up like this thread

1067
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,380
hunting book as well cyber ease and some

1068
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,180
other stuff too you don't have to

1069
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,390
register you have that until they take

1070
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,520
it down all right follow this guy

1071
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,319
already mentioned about Sean Metcalf he

1072
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,670
does awesome stuff he's probably one of

1073
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,689
the most brilliant guys

1074
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:22,819
I know in addition to Jessica as well

1075
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,019
and these are just a few people so I

1076
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:25,579
want to mention it because I'm on the

1077
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:27,140
camera too I want to mention that

1078
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:31,999
there's so many people that are really

1079
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,589
really smart I I recommend you talk to

1080
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,899
them we're trying to do the same thing

1081
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:37,429
over and over again right now Microsoft

1082
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,929
ignite right now I don't even know where

1083
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:42,709

didn't know but but pretty cool stuff

1086
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:50,089
don't forget about application security

1087
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,009
oh wasps how many open web application

1088
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:52,400
security project members here all right

1089
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:55,999
awesome

1090
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,160
don't forget about that there's from

1091
00:42:55,999 --> 00:43:00,288
2017 there's oh I stopped and obviously

1092
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,699
one of the things was if if there was a

1093
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,910
oh I stopped one there was actually

1094
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:07,249
being fixed a lot of the OWASP top 10 or

1095
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,149
you know stuff that's over and over

1096
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:10,459
again right

1097
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,529
cross-site scripting disclosure blah

1098
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:14,629
blah blah or injection it's over and

1099
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:16,160
over again but there's also a wast

1100
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,369
mobile security project there's always

1101
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,410
cheat sheets as well and then this is

1102
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:23,749
more like that we're helping this some

1103
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,609
so like yeah so ori this is our boss

1104
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:27,410
application security conference we have

1105
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:30,140
a lot of it's all free we don't record

1106
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:33,348
everything but we have it every year we

1107
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,269
have about 200 people 200 yeah 200

1108
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:37,039
people but really interesting so take a

1109
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:41,479
look at that take a look at your OS

1110
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:43,369
local chapters - okay so this is show

1111
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:46,279
then how many people use - or 10 right

1112
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:48,920
it's just it's a great utility for is to

1113
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:53,989
create a web web site for those of you

1114
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,269
who have e education or academia emails

1115
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:59,390
you can actually get it for free just

1116
00:43:56,269 --> 00:44:00,919
basically contact I forgot his name you

1117
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,279
can actually get it for free as well the

1118
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,609
full version for educational people

1119
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:09,559
educational people that work in academia

1120
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:11,029
yeah great information here make sure

1121
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:13,369
that you're doing your open source

1122
00:44:11,029 --> 00:44:16,640
intelligence to not only logging the

1123
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:18,589
logs but taking a look at hopefully your

1124
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,390
servers in the network and your company

1125
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,130
are not advertised here hopefully

1126
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,449
there's not an Amazon echo in your

1127
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,339
company hopefully there's not an ass

1128
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:27,079
hopefully there's not a big I don't know

1129
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:29,420

your company and right there so take a

1131
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,509
look at that

1132
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,529
all right I'm sorry I went too fast

1133
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:37,359
google hacking I think where everyone

1134
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:39,130
already knows this Google Dorking Google

1135
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,480
door google hacking Google Dorking

1136
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,269
everyone knows who came from Johnny long

1137
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,799
many many years ago he was the one that

1138
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:48,368
originated with it

1139
00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:51,279
he has a non-profit hackers for charity

1140
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:53,049
that he says he's been in Africa yeah

1141
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:55,299
awesome stuff take a look at it

1142
00:44:53,049 --> 00:44:57,460
there's exploit Google hacking all the

1143
00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:58,839
different terms you can use this I just

1144
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,940
copied like yesterday so you get more

1145
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:03,460
information offensive security for those

1146
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,859
of you that want to get more familiar

1147
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,859
with Metasploit offensive security you

1148
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:10,299
can also basically donate to them too

1149
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:12,690
but they have this course for free

1150
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:14,650
everyone know that there's a Metasploit

1151
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,700
Metasploit offensive security unleash

1152
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:21,670
you can actually learn all Metasploit

1153
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,890
online for free melty go how many people

1154
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,480
use that I'm actually waiting for the

1155
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,980
Black Friday so I can get it up for a

1156
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,130
good price there's many different

1157
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,200
versions of it but um there's just a

1158
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,839
community version too obviously but you

1159
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,118
can kind of see it's not in here I think

1160
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:38,739
they may have changed it but um you can

1161
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,690
kind of get an idea of what it's

1162
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,910
basically based on transforms it's based

1163
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:45,690
on transforms are kind of like think of

1164
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,098
it as um different searches into

1165
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:51,970
applications as well what they call it

1166
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:53,619
in in melty go and you can look at again

1167
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,689
public source information using this

1168
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:57,460
melty go as well so pretty pretty

1169
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,890
interesting but do your thing make sure

1170
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:03,249
it's from petrova you can get more

1171
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:05,470
information as well bless you all right

1172
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:08,470
so this guy I actually follow a lot too

1173
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:11,259
because um yeah I was really lucky I um

1174
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:15,098
I worked in Hong Kong for about almost

1175
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:17,140
one year and yep hey oh yeah yep cool

1176
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,430
yeah I'm glad to be back again with all

1177
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,660
the you know the different things that

1178
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,848
are happening I won't talk about that

1179
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,819
that's another talk this guy is awesome

1180
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:27,400
he he used to be in the UK and he has a

1181
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:28,989
lot of great red team tips not only this

1182
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,180
guy there's many more people but I

1183
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:33,730
wanted to kind of call up call out Tim

1184
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,749
because blue teamers we need to we need

1185
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,259
to remember we need to be hundred

1186
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:42,390
percent right right so take a look at

1187
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:43,680
the red team's as well different tips -

1188
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,390
cool

1189
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,160
two minutes all right so incident

1190
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,410
response obviously I won't have as much

1191
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,700
time but for those are you doing instant

1192
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,770
response as well you're growing it

1193
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,828
you're maturing it be sure to do

1194
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:58,500
tabletop exercises we've be sure to do

1195
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:59,880
practice repetition get lessons learn be

1196
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,970
sure to work with your internal teams

1197
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,220
not only in your internal group internal

1198
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,680
external people outside your department

1199
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,868
as well and also external people from

1200
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,790
the you know the third parties that

1201
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,280
you're working with as well I'm sorry

1202
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,900
about that and then keep continuing

1203
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,700
updating your policies procedures plans

1204
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,309
always be ready stay calm practice you

1205
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,078
know practice to not make mistakes the

1206
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:23,579
more repetitive you do the more

1207
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,980
checklists you have the more procedures

1208
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,809
you have than work the more it's easier

1209
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,880
to do if you're if you're not trained

1210
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:31,109
for it and then you have a large

1211
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,819
incidence what are you gonna do you're

1212
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:34,950
gonna you're not gonna be calm you're

1213
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:35,490
not gonna be I also do that is very

1214
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,759
important

1215
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:41,669
that's the mist from 2012 old one from

1216
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,940
the instant response forensics tools

1217
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:47,760
pretty much who knows buscador a saint

1218
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,349
oh saint vm right it's mostly from oh

1219
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,369
saint techniques

1220
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:56,579
yeah intel techniques calm i believe yes

1221
00:47:53,369 --> 00:48:01,079
yep exactly yep and then CN sift sans

1222
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:03,299
provides also a forensics a forensics

1223
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:05,220
image as well and also cali and many

1224
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:06,930
others too but again you should always

1225
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,910
have not only for your policies

1226
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:12,270
procedures etc you should really have

1227
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:15,509
your your VMs virtual but whatever

1228
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:17,940
VirtualBox VM is VMware ready to you

1229
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,680
should be edited for your corporate for

1230
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,319
your corporate testing because you have

1231
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,640
to you have to you probably have to

1232
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:25,980
analyze some malware analyze some other

1233
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,109
stuff right sandboxing etc so be ready

1234
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,059
for that too

1235
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:32,040
okay leaving off the lamb the end how

1236
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,829
many people have heard of this so this

1237
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:38,400
is actually command-line evasion so for

1238
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:40,859
example let's say you are basically

1239
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,660
recording command line right this

1240
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:46,319
website right here living on tool and

1241
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:48,000
you can a attacker or cyber criminal or

1242
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:51,089
red team can make the command line look

1243
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,920
look so bad so that you can't even tell

1244
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:54,630
what it is or it can be embedded in a

1245
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,579
different process or some other stuff

1246
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,390
too this is great information here is a

1247
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,039
great project

1248
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,950
you can also contribute to this project

1249
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:06,119
too it's open source it's freeware but

1250
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:08,129
it's the the attackers the you know lets

1251
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,259
the attackers red teamers they use this

1252
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,930
to cybercriminals they use this so that

1253
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:13,499
in your log source you're unable to tell

1254
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:18,419
what it is

1255
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:19,169
so okay recommendations I think I'm good

1256
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,390
awesome green

1257
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,420
okay so recommendations these are just

1258
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:26,190
my opinions but you know no dye network

1259
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,319
do your job well and automate when

1260
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:30,900
possible because these cyber criminals

1261
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:33,930
attackers they're doing that already try

1262
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,029
to measure document your gaps to lessons

1263
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,419
learn progress progress that has been

1264
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:41,839
made if it's not you or let's say it's

1265
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,309
your manager review and edit the report

1266
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,650
take a look at it make sure that all the

1267
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:50,640
technical jargon is done it is out there

1268
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,950
making sure that bring it to someone

1269
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,509
outside of technology to see if they

1270
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,680
actually understand it when you're

1271
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:57,509
actually presenting in front of the

1272
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,828
leadership team they want to see red

1273
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:00,269
green blue they want to see something

1274
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,220
simple they don't want to see

1275
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:05,129
vulnerability scans CVE

1276
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,348
x-ray or whatever it is make it simple

1277
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,869
network network network I think everyone

1278
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:11,239
here has already been doing that

1279
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:14,239
participate in more of the you know the

1280
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:16,349
sharing blue team the information etc

1281
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,970
also at the same time for does you

1282
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:21,150
there's also the mental health hackers

1283
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:23,069
too we have a lot of stress especially

1284
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,509
incident response engagements you know

1285
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:26,099
we're always working we working work

1286
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:28,980
from anywhere in the world always

1287

1289
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:39,900
and with that I want to open up for

1290
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:44,369
questions we have about eleven minutes

1291

00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,819
would have to get back to you on that

1307
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:32,680
yeah sorry about that

1308
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,470
yeah but the question was how often do

1309
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,779
you see frequency analysis on the on the

1310
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,160
blue team side I don't know I have to I

1311
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,020
have to look I had to take a look I

1312
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,140
think sands does something I think

1313
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,550
there's some other but I'm not I ought

1314
00:51:44,140 --> 00:52:00,879
to top my head I don't know that answer

1315
00:51:45,550 --> 00:52:03,430
so yeah yeah exactly yeah okay

1316
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,869
yeah I which I still don't know yes to

1317
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,890
that question I don't know if anyone

1318
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:10,420
wants to comments I'm but yeah I

1319
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,379
fortunately I think yeah I'll have to

1320
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,850
get back to you on that

1321
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:25,859
yep any any any other questions any

1322
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:25,859
other questions good yes yes sir yes

1323
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:38,220
yeah yeah so the question was so are

1324
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:41,080
there any recommended like logging etc

1325
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,480
it's not a one-size-fits-all for every

1326
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,790
company organization what may work for

1327
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,410
like um you know my company or your

1328
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,450
company may not work for someone else as

1329
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,490
well so everyone is I doing their own

1330
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,899
thing but I mean there's there's

1331
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:54,790
recommendations about what you'd be

1332
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,100
logging but obviously right if you

1333
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,800
ingest started ingesting workstation

1334
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,020
logs and it's gonna be a huge huge stuff

1335
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,760
you probably want to just ingest stuff

1336
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,150
but but you know try to parse it out

1337
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,710
parse it out bit by that most there's

1338
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,840
actually I think I put in here but if

1339
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,700
not I'll put in there too for the red

1340
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,590
team side there's are actually from

1341
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:19,359
Microsoft they actually have a list of

1342
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:21,420
all the the top top maybe like 20 to 50

1343
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,920
50 to 100 when

1344
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,750
security event logs that should be

1345
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,510
looked at whether it be like a security

1346
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,040
operation center or etc as well so I can

1347
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:38,880
only say on that but yeah it's not a

1348
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:41,549
one-size-fits-all so yes sure oh yeah

1349
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,770
yeah sure yep so the question was are

1350
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:46,049
there any companies or industries using

1351
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:51,150
like a third party yep so a lot of the

1352
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:53,040
MS SPS shared partners um a lot of

1353
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:55,170
companies also because they're again

1354
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,089
right show of hands how many people have

1355
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,430
how many people have like a hundred

1356
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:03,470
people and their security team right

1357
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:05,970
okay so alright so yeah there's a lot of

1358
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:07,890
security operation center that are doing

1359
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:11,430
it whether it be like a they'll secure

1360
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:14,040
works or something else to do there's

1361
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,950
many there's many this just came on the

1362
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,359
top of my head but there's so many

1363
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,669
you'll see like every industry using

1364
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:22,109
their own thing to but it also depends

1365
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,470
on like the amount of users as well

1366
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:27,808
thank you amount of users etc but again

1367
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:32,790
it's not a one size fits all but I know

1368
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:35,520
that uh you know there's we don't have a

1369
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,799
hundred people so and also at the same

1370
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,599
time we're not working 24/7 so we

1371
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:42,059
probably need like some kind of dirt

1372
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,730
party or third party or vendor to help

1373
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:48,359
us to basically monitor that 24/7 as

1374
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:55,819
well so so yeah good question yep any

1375
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:55,819
other questions going once yes yes sir

1376
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:06,680
yes yeah so um there was one the there

1377
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,990
was that uh this is there and the NX log

1378
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,359
and also that PowerShell script called

1379
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,680
um deep blue as well and those those are

1380
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,260
just some recommendations to there's

1381
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,200
many more to that you can start off with

1382
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:20,480
you if there's nothing currently that

1383
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:32,569
you have as well so there's many yep so

1384
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:35,030
oh yeah um yeah um yeah the question was

1385
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:37,750
is there any recommendation um for for

1386
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:40,010
different it's a not a one size fits all

1387
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,180
what I would take a look at what a

1388
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,460
recommendation I would look at is

1389
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,710
actually the top critical Windows

1390
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,540
security event IDs and put defenses

1391
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:49,820
around it um I think one of the things

1392
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,490
that I forgot was um I think one on the

1393
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,500
slides is it's hard to do white listing

1394
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:56,810
but when you actually know like what is

1395
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,010
in the environments you can actually you

1396
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,930
know put like a white list together

1397
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:02,750
anything any deviation from that white

1398
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:04,370
list you know so something like that too

1399
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,070
but the main thing is really just to

1400
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:10,790
know like what is normal as well yep so

1401
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:14,830
yeah Pete well thanks a lot everyone

1402
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:17,860
