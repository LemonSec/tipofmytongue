1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,950
if I put it down and you can't hear me

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:08,760
let me know and I'll pick it back up so

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:12,450
hi nice to see you all my name is Lauren

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,160
and as was quickly said I run daily

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,870
malar strategies which is a strategic

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,509
communications firm and I want to give

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,939
you a smidge of a background on why in

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,140
the world that's relevant for here today

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,279
because it sounds like I just took a

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,189
wrong turn and ended up at the wrong

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,390
conference but I do that all the time

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,970
and this is one of my favorite things to

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,769
do is to take what I do and talk to

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,480
people who do what you do because in

15
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,190
reality we should know a lot more about

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,199
each other and then we'd all be a lot

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,620
better at what we do which is kind of

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,250
the point

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,149
so I started dealing - trotta G's about

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,879
three and a half years ago my whole the

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,670
first ten years of my career was down in

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,050
DC doing security communications with

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,579
the government in different cool roles

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,709
and sitting in different cool buildings

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,020
and working at different cool agencies

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,640
and then enough of that came up here

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,710
started doing corporate communications

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,660
in New York City and quickly learned

29
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,220
that I was bored out of my mind because

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,679
if you have ever done corporate

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,340
communications it is boring as hell

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,770
so learned a lot really awesome missed

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,450
the security missed linking those two

34
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,009
parts of my life together love the

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,009
communications love the security and

36
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,570
this is where we landed this marries all

37
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,500
those worlds and it's been such a fun

38
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,570
space to play in so I mostly work in

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,030
cybersecurity communications so a lot of

40
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,770
Incident Response stuff and a lot of

41
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,079
stuff that falls outside of that space

42
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,820
in me internally how can we communicate

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,380
better between our team and the rest of

44
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,298
the organization how can we communicate

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,369
better with the board how can we

46
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,200
communicate better externally with our

47
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,119
customers so that they understand what

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
we do and why we do it better than that

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
guy over there because in reality we all

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,250
use the same words and we all sound

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,039
alike to pretty much everybody that

52
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,530
we're selling stuff to so that's where I

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,020
spend a lot of this time and the peace

54
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,390
of all of that that I want to touch on

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,070
here today it's something that I've

56
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,649
noticed becoming an increasingly

57
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,990
important and relevant thing when

58
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,090
talking to different clients and working

59
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,849
with different organizations because a

60
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,960
lot of the challenges that people have

61
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,820
especially

62
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,410
and I don't like saying we're doing

63
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,970
crisis communications Werner in cyber

64
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,370
because half the time it's not a crisis

65
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,390
and everyone just thinks it is so when

66
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,130
we're doing incident response

67
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,820
communications that can cover a variety

68
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,500
of things the heart of what really makes

69
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,480
something successful and what you're

70
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,170
seeing become an increasing challenge is

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,500
that organizations are responding to

72
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,920
events in a way that causes them to lose

73
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,930
the trust of the people whose trust

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,359
matters to the very heart of what their

75
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,470
organization does so we're gonna get

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,060
into that a little bit here but

77
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,000
essentially you lose the trust of the

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,730
people who matter and who come to you as

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,460
customers and clients and whatever form

80
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,280
that is and how in the world can you

81
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,740
keep that from happening in your role

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,760
when your role is not the PR guys

83
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,170
sitting on the other side of the

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,910
building talking to the media all the

85
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,709
time and we're gonna talk a little bit

86
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,060
about what the trust piece is the

87
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,120
security piece is how they overlap

88
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,460
together and what you can do in your

89
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
role unless you anybody here actually

90
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,330
sit in a communications or marketing

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,570
role because if so you actually took a

92
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,750
wrong turn you you really did mean to be

93
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,829
somewhere else so I I don't talk to

94
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,820
those folks because they already get

95
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,020
this they already think they know what

96
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,480
they're doing I like talking to you

97
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,370
because quite often your ass on the line

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,200
when something goes wrong so let's make

99
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,390
sure you understand how to make it go

100
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,369
right across the organization and how to

101
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,440
provide information into that process

102
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,450
that makes everything more successful on

103
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,109
the other end so that's where we are

104
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,760
Trust insecurity not often two things in

105
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,590
their traditional sense that come

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,720
together but both of them are so

107
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,060
incredibly critical to keeping an

108
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,240
organization going and will interchange

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,260
business company organization I don't

110
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,640
care if you work at a school I don't

111
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,570
care if you work at a non-profit I don't

112
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,250
care if you work at an enterprise a

113
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,579
small business it doesn't matter

114
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,770
this piece of that is gonna be shaped

115
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,500
like you but foundationally it's gonna

116
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,530
be the same as everybody else so bear

117
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,210
with me on the vocabulary I also say

118
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,180
cyber not InfoSec if that offends you

119
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:20,900
there's a room downstairs

120
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,400
all right so trust in security

121
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,400
okay this is older than me believe it or

122
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,710
not I just hit my 40th birthday so I

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,880
feel

124
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,530
like I walk into any room and I'm like

125
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,639
yep grandma's here what's up how you

126
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,068
guys doing so this is how I view so many

127
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,240
different organizations so many

128
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,310
different companies you go in you've got

129
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,259
trust and it's all and nice and neat and

130
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,550
it's in the little PR and marketing and

131
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,860
calm side of the house and it's all

132
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,970
shiny and pretty and then their security

133
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,009
is like get out of the way I'm in the

134
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,770
trenches I'm getting down and getting

135
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,870
dirty I'm fixing stuff and they have to

136
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,219
be linked together so we're gonna talk a

137
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,199
little bit about both I want to start on

138
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,750
the security side and bare with me we're

139
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,300
gonna do a lot of what I think is very

140
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,919
logical stepping through these different

141
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,570
things so the objective of security

142
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,520
that's a company an organization a

143
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,580
school whatever is to protect the

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,680
organization it's very easy to think

145
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,198
that it is simply to protect the network

146
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,560
to protect the system to protect this

147
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,560
device this thing but in reality you are

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,380
part of a larger functioning ecosystem

149
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,159
within your company that all has to work

150
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,409
together to protect itself at any point

151
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,599
at any point in time so the overall

152
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,990
objectives for security has to be a

153
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:39,490
broader wider view than just the thing

154
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,110
that's right in front of you and the

155
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,190
more that you can understand about that

156
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,810
broader view even if you're only

157
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,150
responsible for the thing in front of

158
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,070
you the more you can understand that

159
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,469
wider view the better off you're gonna

160
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:55,000
be at protecting that thing and helping

161
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:58,300
the overall ecosystem function in a

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,330
crisis in an incident in an event

163
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,880
whatever your word is of the day the

164
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,090
objective from the business side is to

165
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,030
recover with as minimal of a long-term

166
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:14,440
impact as possible it's to make sure

167
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:17,440
that when this is done when the dust is

168
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,539
settled that we're still operating on

169
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,219
the other end that that bump isn't a big

170
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,599
bump this is when you talk about the

171
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,669
difference between an incident and a

172
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,219
crisis you can take an incident and you

173
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,530
can mishandle it left right up down in

174
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:31,599
sideways and turn it into a crisis but

175
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,219
it doesn't have to start that way but

176
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,199
there's a difference and no matter what

177
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,750
size or what shape the event is you're

178
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,569
looking at the object is to get through

179
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,629
it with as minimal of a bump

180
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,189
possible this is really all wrapped up

181
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,899
in the concept I know we've all heard a

182
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:49,149
billion times over of everything's

183
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,699
resilience it's how you get through it

184
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:52,809
it's making sure at the end of the day

185
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,599
everything about your organization is

186
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,369
thriving

187
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,639
afterwards just as much as it was

188
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:03,159
thriving before that's key

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,759
not just your piece but every part of

190
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,529
the company and it means that it's not

191
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,080
enough to just get your piece of the

192
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:15,180
world your network your system clean and

193
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,378
up and running if you somehow to do that

194
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,289
screwed up other parts of the business

195
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,379
that are now no longer thriving a good

196
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:25,149
example here is customer relationships

197
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,830
that sounds completely foreign and

198
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,539
disconnecting from anything else you're

199
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,959
hearing in this room and that's good

200
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:34,839
because then you'd be in the wrong spot

201
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,129
but when you look at the kinds of things

202
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,779
that you see now that are big and scary

203
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,759
about data breaches out in the real

204
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:42,849
world like in the headlines in the media

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,800
the ones that you're seeing are the ones

206
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,779
that are being handled poorly and that

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,580
are becoming bigger and bigger and

208
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,919
bigger problems and a lot of time that's

209
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:55,330
related to the fact that they're

210
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:57,099
impacting and being mishandled one on

211
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,258
one in a relationship in a

212
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,300
communications with the customers and

213
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,069
the people who are directly impacted so

214
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,499
it's not enough to just handle your

215
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,759
piece of it if you in doing so you

216
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:11,469
manage to screw up everything else

217
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:14,079
that's not resilience so we talked a

218
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:15,550
little bit about the actual costs of a

219
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,740
data breach and where this actually

220
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,149
links in we're moving here kind of

221
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,349
quickly because this is a 30 minute talk

222
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,479
that's usually an hour

223
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,369
so you're welcome I cut out like four

224
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,109
slides that I'm gonna talk fast so bear

225
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,680
with me here you didn't have cookies

226
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,559
you'll stay

227
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,749
more awake than the rest of us or maybe

228
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:33,669
I should have had fewer I don't know so

229
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:36,789
if we look at the 2019 cost of a data

230
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,588
breach report that came out thank you

231
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,630
very much Boeing the new IBM love that

232
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,689
thing the average cost of a data breach

233
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,360
this year three point nine two million

234
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:48,279
okay that's a lot of money where is that

235
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,959
cost coming from what are the different

236
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,889
buckets one point for two million or 36%

237
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,258
the

238
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:59,679
just bucket of what makes up that

239
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:01,569
average cost is lost business lots of

240
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,399
things go into lost business but one of

241
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:09,339
the big pieces of that category is lost

242
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,379
customers it's people who used to give

243
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,759
you money to do something who are now

244
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,369
choosing to give that money to someone

245
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,739
else and not to you that hurts your

246
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:18,759
business you lose customers that hurts

247
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:22,049
your business you lose all your

248
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,049
customers you don't even have a business

249
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,259
we were really interesting to statistics

250
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,290
that were included in the report

251
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,850
this year that I had not seen previously

252
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,439
that indicate to me that other people

253
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,279
are paying more attention to this

254
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,929
particular slice of our world companies

255
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:40,269
that lost less than 1% of their

256
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:43,329
customers after a data breach had an

257
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:45,339
average cost of 2.8 million dollars they

258
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:48,699
saved nearly 1.1 million dollars by

259
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:51,549
losing fewer customers companies that

260
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:54,209
lost over 4% of their customers had an

261
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:57,069
average cost of 5.7 million

262
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,779
significantly higher so what do you

263
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:01,449
think the average percentage of loss

264
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,309
customers is where do you think on that

265
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:08,169
in that range between less than 1 and

266
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:10,419
more than 4 average 3.9 percent that's

267
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:12,249
how close everybody is to hitting these

268
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:16,059
higher numbers and having that bigger

269
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:20,049
impact just from customer loss so why is

270
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:23,439
it that some companies lose and cost

271
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:27,339
more and some companies lose and cost

272
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:28,988
less what's the distinction it was

273
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,850
really interesting looking at some of

274
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:32,939
the others there was another study again

275
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,100
another Pony Minh study that they did

276
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:39,519
65% of breach victims said that they

277
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,860
lost trust in the organization they

278
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,149
specifically cited the loss of trust and

279
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,169
of that group

280
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:48,669
27% discontinued their relationship so

281
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,350
you find that there's a relationship

282
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:53,189
there's a correlation between losing

283
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,619
trust and taking your business elsewhere

284
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:59,349
in the context of a data breach that's

285
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:01,539
the overlap there was a specific finding

286
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,389
that the loss of customer trust had

287
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:07,470
serious financial consequences for the

288
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,900
companies experiencing this data breach

289
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,090
and there was a relationship documented

290
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,800
between having a strong security posture

291
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:18,750
and having loyal customers and Trust

292
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,939
those two things were related that's not

293
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,680
an area that has been studied for years

294
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,320
and years and years like a lot of other

295
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,630
impact studies have done but it's

296
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,640
becoming a more relevant thing it's

297
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,050
becoming a more common thing and it's

298
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,090
causing people to look at it more and I

299
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,839
expect to see more like this in the

300
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,030
coming years so Trust is obviously

301
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,080
important Trust is obviously impacted

302
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:46,439
during a data breach but what exactly is

303
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,700
it that we're talking about though it

304
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,900
seems like one of those obvious words

305
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,220
where no one actually knows how to

306
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,930
define it because everyone just kind of

307
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,840
knows what it means but if you really

308
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:58,439
look at the words behind it reliability

309
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,510
truth ability and strength of someone or

310
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,520
something we trust that you're going to

311
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,330
be honest and reliable and consistent

312
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,890
and stable over and over it's

313
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,180
foundational to your business it's all

314
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,050
the things we just said if someone

315
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,979
doesn't trust you they're not going to

316
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,579
do business with you they're gonna go

317
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,610
somewhere else

318
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,720
it's very basic none should have said

319
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,040
this in the beginning this is not the

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,900
rocket science lecture

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,550
there's nothing rocket science about

322
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,199
what we're doing I'm pretty sure based

323
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,520
on all the words I understood in the

324
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,320
last session I sat in there was rocket

325
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,480
science down there but there is not

326
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,920
rocket science up here it is just a

327
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,660
piece of something that isn't that

328
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,819
common but when you suddenly put it

329
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,890
together with what you do and the rocket

330
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,910
science II techie cool stuff that you're

331
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,830
working on all the time

332
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,829
something clicks and it makes more sense

333
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,660
so back to trust foundational your

334
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,180
business it drives your reputation

335
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,439
trusts a reputation go back and forth

336
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,089
they're interrelated you get a

337
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,030
reputation for being trustworthy you

338
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,950
have more business you grow you lose

339
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,890
that trust your reputation decreases you

340
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,900
lose business you're done it says that

341
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,360
it's as simple as that it's such a

342
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,760
common thing in other parts of the

343
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,150
business world to talk about that the

344
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,520
actual term trusted consumer brand is a

345
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,680
thing that companies aspire to think

346
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,329
about something like Starbucks or I know

347
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,300
apples a bad example it usually works in

348
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,000
other crowds but go with me people who

349
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,670
buy from those stores don't do it

350
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
because of very specific details about

351
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,410
the Prada

352
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,750
they're getting there they don't do it

353
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,790
because Starbucks coffee is amazing it's

354
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,589
actually burnt we all know that but we

355
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,180
go there anyway because it's Starbucks

356
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,200
and it's reliable and it's consistent

357
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,569
and it's gonna be fine

358
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,180
that's a trusted consumer brand people

359
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,760
want that and it's all around I just

360
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,989
trust your name and that's it

361
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,510
so do you build trust if it's not

362
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,970
important if only there was some like

363
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,730
magical thing that we knew would lead to

364
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,579
trust and actually build it and preserve

365
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:54,660
it and grow it and oh wait yeah that's

366
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:56,310
there so this this is an area that the

367
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,750
business side of the world has been

368
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,449
exploring for decades

369
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,720
what causes trust what builds trust what

370
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,529
loses trust how do you get trust back

371
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,329
right there communication good

372
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,380
communications builds trust talking to

373
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:13,140
people how do you build trust in your

374
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,310
personal lives how you get co-workers to

375
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,500
trust you neighbors to trust you

376
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,599
teachers to trust you you talk to each

377
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,700
other you communicate and you do it

378
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,279
effectively you do it in a way that is

379
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,350
consistent that is reliable that is

380
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,480
honest and again we're not gonna jump

381
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,920
into all these details here these are

382
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,750
words that if you don't already know

383
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,079
what they mean see me after we'll figure

384
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,430
it out it's transparent its informative

385
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,750
it means when you're talking to someone

386
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,760
you're actually telling them information

387
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,440
you're not just talking at them because

388
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,250
the sound of your voice is cool and you

389
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,310
have nothing else to say

390
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,940
there are times and places to say

391
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,279
nothing with lots of words that's a

392
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,079
whole different talk also but there's a

393
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,570
place for that and it's in this space

394
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,109
too but it's not part of the consistent

395
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:00,750
trust building side of the house Trust

396
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,149
is built through actions and words it's

397
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:05,880
not just what you say it's how you back

398
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:08,399
it up with what you do and then how you

399
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,260
tell people what you're doing not just

400
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,510
what you did for one person but how you

401
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,699
told everyone else what you did so that

402
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,230
everybody understood and believed that

403
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:21,269
your actions were reliable and

404
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:23,519
trustworthy good communication both in

405
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,990
words in actions and in how you talk

406
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,750
about those things that you are doing

407
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,630
that's how you build trust and Trust

408
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,550
again going backwards so it's not rocket

409
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:35,000
science Trust is something that drives

410
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:38,569
your business

411
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,829
fun facts I like fun facts didn't put

412
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,899
any gold stars in this one but there

413
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:44,680
would be stars all around here we do a

414
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:49,069
lot of gold stars in my house I put ones

415
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:54,560
another survey 55% of IT and data

416
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:56,540
security folks thought knew that a data

417
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,459
breach was going to negatively impact

418
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,750
the organization's reputation I'm not

419
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,969
sure if I should be excited that it was

420
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,160
55 or incredibly depressed it was only

421
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:08,750
55 it's better than 54 so we'll take it

422
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,889
55 knew it was going to negatively

423
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:17,060
impact reputation 71% didn't think they

424
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:21,050
had to care 71% it's not my job that's

425
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,930
fine no big deal take a little step back

426
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,849
to what we just talked about about the

427
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,250
impacts of a data breach being driven by

428
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,230
the loss of trust and reputation amongst

429
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,399
your customers do you think maybe

430
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,860
somewhere in there there might be a

431
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,009
reason that you should also care who

432
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,839
gets fired who loses their job when a

433
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:43,910
breach goes horribly horribly wrong

434
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,519
is it the marketing team nope if it is

435
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,819
whoa go somewhere else that place is

436
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,850
weird 71% do not believe that it is

437
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:53,899
their responsibility and only 18%

438
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,129
collaborate with other functions at the

439
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:59,930
organization on brand protection

440
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,839
something as simple as making sure that

441
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,980
our IR plan accounts for something like

442
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,350
preserving customer trust only 18% that

443
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,980
is a very small number of the people in

444
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:16,039
this room but hey 18 is better than 17

445
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,110
but what could you do so that you are in

446
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,150
the 18 how can you make sure you're in

447
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,399
the 18 what can you do from your role to

448
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,620
balance the security you're directly

449
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,900
responsible for and the trust that you

450
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,520
are responsible for maintaining across

451
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,240
your entire organization because that's

452
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,260
the whole point of security we're gonna

453
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,270
go through this part kind of quickly

454
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:40,520
here I am gonna make sure we add more or

455
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:43,549
less on time here I like to start with

456
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,110
looking at an event timeline I'm really

457
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,629
bad at graphics bear with me that little

458
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,809
red thing right there that's an event

459
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,220
we're

460
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,720
call that we're gonna call that a date

461
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,710
of reach for simplicity okay we rent

462
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,809
like it's a big one because those are

463
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,749
easier examples so when you look at an

464
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:58,730
event timeline you have the time period

465
00:17:56,749 --> 00:18:01,220
you know I've seen this presented a

466
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,870
million ways left of boom whatever you

467
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,129
want to call it like this is normal life

468
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,149
nothing's gone wrong everything's fine

469
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:09,678
what can you do in that time period

470
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:12,469
something happens huh

471
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,879
chaos reigns something happens you're

472
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,769
fitting the fan everyone's trying out to

473
00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:18,350
be the one who gets fired during what

474
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:21,139
can you do during and then what can you

475
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,369
do after what can you do after probably

476
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,320
to turn this into a circle one of these

477
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,209
days and I'm not being lazy but what do

478
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,460
you do after as you cycle back into that

479
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,129
before period and things get back to

480
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,929
normal and you do it all again what can

481
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:39,350
you do to maintain trust from your role

482
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:40,850
beforehand Trust Bank Trust Bank Trust

483
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,998
Bank there's a million different words

484
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,759
for this too it's a very common concept

485
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,379
in the business side of the world what

486
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,769
can you do to build up the trust bank

487
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:54,668
before it starts so that you have

488
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:57,440
something to draw down when you need it

489
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,450
having a built up stash of trust having

490
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,779
people who already really trust you

491
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,610
because you've proven yourself ahead of

492
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:07,070
time mean that when something goes wrong

493
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,418
they're gonna give you just enough slack

494
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,340
to catch your breath and figure out

495
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,539
what's going on they're not gonna be all

496
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,100
over you immediately because they

497
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:16,220
already see I told you they weren't

498
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,259
trustworthy they're gonna pause before

499
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,659
they say that and that pause gives you a

500
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,480
chance we're gonna talk a little bit

501
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,059
more about each of these during you got

502
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,210
a walk and chew gum at the same time

503
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:30,379
same time walk and chew gum that concept

504
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,960
doesn't mean anything to you see me

505
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,980
afterwards we'll explain it again what

506
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,549
it means you have to do all these things

507
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,499
at one time

508
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,820
you can't just be focused on fixing the

509
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,940
incident you have to be focused on

510
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,470
fixing the incident and communicating

511
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,759
effectively about it to the people who

512
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,440
need the information at the same time

513
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,619
you have to be able to do more than one

514
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,230
thing at a time and then after review

515
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,178
what worked what didn't start over fix

516
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,340
it if you broke something along the way

517
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,659
fix it fast if you did it great make a

518
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,000
note of what worked so you have it for

519
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,420
next time you're getting back into that

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,310
standard normal so before

521
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:08,170
building up the Trust Bank how do you do

522
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:10,179
that how do you develop trust build up a

523
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,920
positive reputation how do you pick the

524
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,630
right words have the right actions we

525
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,880
just talked about this it's good

526
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,190
communication but it's a little more

527
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,220
than that and it's a lot more than that

528
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,480
when your role is not the person sitting

529
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,990
over in the marketing team doing all the

530
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,170
talking

531
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,610
from your place from your spot whatever

532
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,990
shape that may be in whether you're

533
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,580
security whether you're attack whether

534
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,410
you're in the wrong room and you're not

535
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:37,320
sure why you're here whatever your role

536
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:40,180
is building up relationships internally

537
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,790
amongst your team and amongst teams that

538
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,260
are not yours across the organization

539
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,760
building those relationships ahead of

540
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,990
time because you were going to need to

541
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,820
interact with each other when something

542
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,320
goes wrong you're gonna need to know who

543
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,570
to talk to on the Khans team who to talk

544
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,929
to an HR who in the world to talk to it

545
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,990
legal and knowing all of those things

546
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,580
because at some point something that

547
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,050
happens will intersect with your little

548
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,389
slice of the world whatever shape that

549
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,970
may be and knowing who to talk to about

550
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,810
what at that moment is critical and

551
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:13,480
having trust built up ahead of time with

552
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:16,210
those individuals in those offices is

553
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,040
gonna make or break the difference for

554
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,240
you and what you're doing and how you're

555
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,530
able to help service it's not just

556
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,790
knowing people and talking to people

557
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,350
it's actually again this I almost feel

558
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,950
even silly for saying this it's doing

559
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,570
your job to the best most reliable most

560
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,420
consistent way that you know how to do

561
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:40,450
it it's being known for and building up

562
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,740
your own reputation in your own seat for

563
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,300
good responsible reliable trustworthy

564
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,890
service and information so that when

565
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,510
people need something from you in the

566
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,710
heat of a moment they know that they're

567
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,290
gonna get something from you that's

568
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,330
worth getting and it's communication

569
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,070
it's talking to people internally

570
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,740
externally across teams across the

571
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,629
company in a way that gives them

572
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,090
information that they need in a reliable

573
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,350
and trustworthy way it's not just

574
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,629
telling them what they want to hear

575
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,939
ignoring their questions because they're

576
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,050
annoying because we all know different

577
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,100
parts of your company are going to be

578
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,340
annoying that's usually where I am but

579
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,320
it's

580
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,179
talking to them and it's building up

581
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,770
those chains of communication so that

582
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,710
they exist when you actually need them

583
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,360
so your Trust Bank is relationships its

584
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,770
service and it's communication and it's

585
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,050
doing all of those things over and over

586
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,730
and over and then when something goes

587
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,440
wrong relying on the fact that you've

588
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,990
already done them and you're not

589
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,220
learning how to do them now during

590
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,710
walking and chewing gum same as we said

591
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,120
before it's a focus on fixing the thing

592
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,690
at hand while at the same time

593
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,580
preserving the other important things of

594
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,350
the company helping make sure that the

595
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,909
things that need to thrive outside of

596
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,679
your space are still thriving and

597
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,640
knowing that the people who are

598
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,350
responsible for the trust piece of that

599
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,790
people who are responsible for

600
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,350
communication because hopefully someone

601
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,389
in your organization is responsible for

602
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,679
communicating during an incident and if

603
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,650
they're not talk to me afterwards we'll

604
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,180
have a longer conversation Incident

605
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,740
Response communications is a very key

606
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,170
part of this that's how you talk to all

607
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,370
those stakeholders and knowing the kinds

608
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,440
of information that need to be relaid at

609
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,959
different times and the kinds of

610
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,210
information and questions that the

611
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,540
person in that position is going to need

612
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,180
in order to effectively communicate is

613
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,620
how you can help and no matter what size

614
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,090
or shape the incident is no matter what

615
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,919
size of shape your organization is

616
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,659
they're always going to be answering the

617
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,100
same exact four questions

618
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,240
if they've been really really really

619
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,350
smart and they've done this ahead of

620
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,970
time you've already answered these

621
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,740
questions with them and they're just

622
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,870
asking you specifically which of these

623
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,090
which of the things applies to the the

624
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,370
incident at hand they always need to

625
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,990
know who am I gonna have to tell who do

626
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:55,260
I have to tell and who should I tell

627
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,970
that's a whole separate conversation

628
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,830
when do I tell them who needs to be told

629
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,870
immediately who can be told later Who am

630
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,480
I required to tell by legal in the next

631
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,949
72 hours who do I need to tell before I

632
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,210
tell that guy so they don't get mad that

633
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,910
I didn't tell them first

634
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,490
etc way more complicated than it should

635
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,380
be how do I tell them they're always

636
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,600
gonna be making a decision about who the

637
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,610
spokesperson is it's not always the same

638
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,439
person what channel am I going to

639
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,689
communicate this information on am I

640
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,150
going to send out an email a notice a

641
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,860
phone call what am I gonna do or say and

642
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,170
what am I going to tell them what

643
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,428
actually is happening what's the end for

644
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,169
me

645
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:34,090
what are the facts what do I know what

646
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:35,860
do I not know what's the content of the

647
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,590
thing that this person is going to tell

648
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,758
it as magic time to this magic group

649
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:44,220
answering those four questions for every

650
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:47,649
specific incident is something that is

651
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,809
not the responsibility of the

652
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,580
communicator to answer it's the

653
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:53,320
responsibility of everyone on the ground

654
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,360
who sits and owns the information to

655
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,809
feed into that process for that decision

656
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,570
and then after your review and your

657
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:04,870
repeats you do the same things you see

658
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,460
how can I take steps how can I take

659
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,008
action that gets us back to regular

660
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,450
order as quickly as possible because

661
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,309
people need to get back there for this

662
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,929
company and for this business what do I

663
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:16,720
need to fix what did I do wrong what

664
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,879
needs to get better what did I miss and

665
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,210
you start over it's the same with any

666
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:23,799
incident response plan that you're

667
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,950
putting together the end is always

668
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:30,250
review adjust repeat as necessary and

669
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,850
you do it until you're done action

670
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,379
matters being consistent matters not

671
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,820
changing your story all the time not

672
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:40,330
changing your information flow all the

673
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,350
time and put a lot of God just try not

674
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:44,408
to do it again while you're still

675
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,939
cleaning up the first stone again this

676
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,620
is not rocket science I shouldn't have

677
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,360
feel silly I've had to say that as many

678
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,830
times as I have in the last few years

679
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,539
if you've already messed something up

680
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,009
and you're still cleaning it up try not

681
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,759
to break anything else pretty

682
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:56,289
straightforward

683
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,590
there's there's no hidden meaning behind

684
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:03,820
that it's exactly what it sounds like

685
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,990
alright so key takeaways we just covered

686
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,590
very quickly because I've been talking

687
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:11,139
very fast a lot of step by step by step

688
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,240
things that if you're not walking out of

689
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:14,649
here afterwards going oh yeah I

690
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,250
definitely already knew that

691
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:20,080
then good I'm glad you listen to this

692
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,379
but if that's what you're thinking then

693
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,629
good because linking those concepts to

694
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:27,219
the work you do every day is not

695
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:29,559
something that you get to do every day

696
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,049
but knowing that all these things are

697
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:33,850
connected and how is what will make you

698
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,379
better at your peace of the world and

699
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,779
give you a better sense of everyone

700
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:39,870
else's world so that you can more

701
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,549
effectively navigate through them

702
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,090
whether you want to move up in the world

703
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,410
at some

704
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,790
point or not or whether you want to stay

705
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,970
where you are and just get better at

706
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,490
what you do so key takeaways good

707
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,030
communication builds trust period end of

708
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,070
story

709
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,590
would drop the mic but it's not mine

710
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,419
before during and after good

711
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,090
communication is always gonna matter and

712
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,920
it's everyone's responsibility it's not

713
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,639
just something that gets locked up in

714
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,500
the corner

715
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,820
you know we joke about like locking the

716
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,350
IT team in a little closet over here

717
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,610
while you're locking your comms team in

718
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,939
a little closet on that side of the

719
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:15,490
house it's important that everybody

720
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,010
realizes that they have a role in a

721
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,410
communicating effectively across the

722
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,450
organization and it you need to take

723
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,590
time if you're not directly involved in

724
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,690
doing it you need to take time to

725
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,659
understand the incident response plan

726
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,490
who's involved when are they involved at

727
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,200
what points do different teams come in

728
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,990
what does it look like what's a crisis

729
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,370
what's not who do I need to be able to

730
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,440
give information to when I have

731
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,389
information so that they can do their

732
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,670
jobs more quickly and more effectively

733
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:44,320
and at the end of the day we can make

734
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,500
good objective decisions and all get

735
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,350
through this in a clean easy way and

736
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,360
don't be afraid to ask for help there's

737
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,879
a lot of stuff here that is not falling

738
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,830
squarely in your wheelhouse and if for

739
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,510
some reason something that seemed really

740
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,460
easy on a Monday suddenly gets really

741
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,320
hard on a Wednesday don't be afraid to

742
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,030
ask somebody don't be afraid to ask for

743
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,980
help in your organization out of your

744
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,649
organization there are people who live

745
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,420
and breathe this stuff and they know how

746
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,310
to link all those different pieces of

747
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,590
the house together in a way that matches

748
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,510
the shape and footprint of your

749
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,909
organization that's what matters there's

750
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,830
no one-size-fits-all here so it's not

751
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,810
it's art and it's science there's more

752
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,610
science than you realize but at the end

753
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,750
of the day it's all about risk

754
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:28,139
management and making the kinds of

755
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:32,100
decisions that help your business thrive

756
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:39,270
that's what we're all doing anyway so Oh

757
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:39,270
any questions yes I know what you got

758
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,570
mhm yes absolutely

759
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:00,570
there's a lot of people who a lot of

760
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,860
times you there's an increasing range of

761
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,510
responsibilities and everyone has a

762
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,189
little bit of a different take on like

763
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,320
all the fancy titles I get flown around

764
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,670
these days but it's essentially you're

765
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,139
all doing the same kind of work but

766
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,929
there is a nod towards the fact that

767
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,780
this trust element has to stretch across

768
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,520
the organization and has to be focused

769
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,230
on by somebody because otherwise it

770
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,570
falls down to everybody else's list

771
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,340
there's always a bigger fire then

772
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,260
preserving trust but at the end of the

773
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,409
day if you don't do it doesn't matter

774
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,700
what fires you put out anyway so yes

775
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,590
it's becoming something that is

776
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,660
definitely bubbling up in a food chain

777
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,399
so the more you understand about it

778
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,530
regardless of where you sit in those

779
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,380
spaces then the better off you're going

780
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:42,330
to be to help not only where your

781
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,640
company needs to be right now but where

782
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,020
they are starting to realize they are

783
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,730
going in the future and you can actually

784
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:56,210
get there ahead of them which is kind of

785
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:56,210
cool though yes those are my favorite oh

786
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,168
I definitely agree on the being

787
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,910
transparent apart I tend to take a

788
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:38,240
slightly less antagonistic role towards

789
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:42,390
the media's relationship with the world

790
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,620
I you know their job is to report their

791
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,000
job is to report things that aren't

792
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,209
necessarily what you want them to report

793
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,410
but one way and again we didn't jump

794
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,200
into all the specifics and all the

795
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,390
details with our time constraint what we

796
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,570
were covering today but if we're diving

797
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,520
into how to do crisis comms right the

798
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,809
right way essentially 101 whether you're

799
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,120
in a cyber scenario or not do audit us

800
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:08,490
in security situations as well if you're

801
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,719
not talking someone else is so there are

802
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,520
a lot of things you can do along the way

803
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,020
to make sure that that's where you get

804
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,240
into that I just gave you a whole bunch

805
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,740
of words but I didn't say anything but

806
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,669
you're gonna report all those words and

807
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,669
then you're not going to make up your

808
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:23,130
own words because I gave you my words so

809
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:26,700
filling those gaps and not leaving big

810
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,140
holes in the public conversation and in

811
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,210
the dialogue whether it's media or

812
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,429
social media in particular is very

813
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,140
critical to maintaining control of the

814
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,460
ship as you're driving along because if

815
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,280
you're not driving it someone else will

816
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,190
and you'd rather be on it than under it

817
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,570
that's probably a better analogy alright

818
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,920
thank you guys so much appreciate it

819
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,919
[Applause]
