1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,000
so I'd like to introduce Andy Dennis

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,989
with election tactic defined and how to

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,390
fight back all right thanks a lot Roman

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,090
everyone can hear me okay I guess yeah

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,830
so yeah I'm Andy Dennis and I'm here

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,539
today to talk to you about election

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,549
hacking you've probably seen it

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,250
mentioned in the news recently or at

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,510
some point over the last two years so

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,940
let me just give you a little bit of an

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,040
introduction to myself before I delve

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,769
into that I worked for a company called

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,510
motors create it's a DC area consultancy

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,390
we do everything from full stack

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,099
architecture through to design I've got

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,149
16 plus years experience in the tech

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,660
industry and in the UK Canada in the US

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:53,730
my role modus is a full-stack architect

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,190
and also I saw up handle a lot of our

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,959
cybersecurity stuff and increasingly I

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,269
can see that that will be becoming a

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,770
greater part of my role in my career I

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,199
have degrees in software engineering

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,610
creative computing and I just recently

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,530
completed a master's degree in

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,570
information security which is kind of

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,400
what was the genesis for this talking

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,380
and I'll cover that and a little bit

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,540
more detail I want to assure you this

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,339
isn't a political talk is to talk about

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,770
political infrastructure and the threats

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,790
they face so there isn't going to be any

33
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,070
debates here or telling you who you

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,729
should or shouldn't vote for I'm gonna

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,399
steer clear of that so the origins of

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,900
this talk so going back to 2016

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,790
you should probably guess my accent I'm

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,860
from the UK originally there was the

39
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,680
brexit referendum which was pretty

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,829
contentious and in the aftermath of that

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,009
there was a lot of I guess you could say

42
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,408
debate in the news and criticism of how

43
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,009
the referendum was run and in addition

44
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:53,280
to that that company such as Cambridge

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,140
analytical a IQ we're using targeted ads

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,540
to try and persuade people to vote one

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,270
way or another in the referendum so that

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,280
was the initial genesis of this then I

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,839
started my master's degree and as many

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,719
of you know probably done one you have

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,780
to write thesis paper so I figured it

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,390
was a pretty interesting topic to to

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,010
cover so following that I went to the

54
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,390
corn went to the votin village and saw

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,239
some of the stalks there and everyone

56
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,549
pulling apart the voting machines last

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,220
year in New York hope there was a really

58
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,720
great talk by Matt Blais and the other

59
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,630
guys that run the voting village really

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,440
on how they acquired the voting machines

61
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,049
and then also in 2017 Chris Sumner who

62
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,950
goes by the name Sagi did a talk at Def

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:41,110
Con on recognized propaganda online so

64
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,940
all of these things came together and

65
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,030
that's how I ended up with that as my

66
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,700
master's degree thesis topic the

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,440
graduate thesis took probably about 16

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,310
months to write and research so it took

69
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,040
place between 2017 and 2019 and I mined

70
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,340
a variety of sources so mainstream media

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,049
academia government papers and then

72
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,510
other cyber security researchers what

73
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,340
they found over the years and in

74
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,590
addition to that I used some Python

75
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,880
scripts to help analyze that day or I'd

76
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:15,130
pull back so I'm just going to make this

77
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,540
caveat at the moment things are moving

78
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,970
very quickly if you've been watching the

79
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,640
press you probably seen Guardian

80
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,170
journalist Carol Cadwallader gave a talk

81
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,779
yesterday to the Irish parliament I

82
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,369
believe it was on fake news there's a

83
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,049
lot of stuff going on at UK in a moment

84
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,030
the with the election coming up

85
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,290
so this talk can really only scratch the

86
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,030
surface so I'm just going to try and

87
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,000
provide you guys with an overview of the

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:42,360
subject so with that side let's let's

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,030
get started so what is election hacking

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,920
coming up with a definition stuff what

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,019
counts as election hacking and what a

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,970
part of a broader category of electoral

93
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,760
related crime so say fraud or money

94
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,410
laundering how does the press and the

95
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,179
government use the term because it would

96
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,060
be quite different and you'll discover

97
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,260
if you go and look online one person's

98
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,030
definition of hacking can be quite

99
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,679
different to someone else's and then of

100
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,329
course what is the origin of the term

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,790
hacking itself we use it but it's still

102
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:14,769
pretty nebulous so the first step was to

103
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,430
try and figure out coming up with a

104
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,200
concrete term or definition sorry for

105
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,330
the term hacking and hacker so when I

106
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,830
wrote the thesis you know anyone reading

107
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,190
it would would have an idea of what I

108
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,150
meant

109
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,250
I

110
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,780
I looked back at the jargon file which

111
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,699
has been around since the 80s I think

112
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,960
and probably has his origins back in the

113
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:39,010
70s and this definition consisted of I

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,080
think there was eight total ideas there

115
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,860
and I took six of them which you can see

116
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,070
one one three six here I think most of

117
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,290
you probably agree with some of the

118
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,909
concepts that are listed here and number

119
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,590
six especially you know a malicious

120
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,330
meddler who tries to discover sensitive

121
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,070
information by poking around it's a

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,530
pretty negative definition and it's used

123
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:03,060
a lot in the media but there is of

124
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,500
course an ounce of truth to that so

125
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,660
having an idea of roughly what we meant

126
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,520
by the term hacker or hacking the next

127
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,010
step was to analyze you know the

128
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,080
zeitgeist around the term what do people

129
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,940
in the media mean when they use the term

130
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,590
hacking and then what do they mean when

131
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,729
they combine it with the word election

132
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,830
so I drilled into the Google API it

133
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,870
gives you a limit of a hundred results

134
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,000
per search I'm not sure if you can go

135
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,930
beyond that if you spend money but based

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,620
upon the small budget I had I basically

137
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,510
mind a thousand links using the term

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,280
election hacking and then nine other

139
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,909
very closely related terms such as

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,739
referendum hacking once I gathered the

141
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,260
data from a thousand links who removed

142
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,080
the duplicates which gave me 587

143
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,580
individual articles and these were a mix

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,889
of different source types coming from

145
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,930
news and academia so some of them were

146
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,000
like CNN articles others were from OC's

147
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,660
of the university's computational

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,210
propaganda unit research unit and then

149
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,880
once I had these two this big set of

150
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,609
data I then sort of did another round of

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,250
analysis the first set of analysis was

152
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,260
to take 18 pre chosen keywords and to

153
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,660
look at that data and say how often do

154
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,960
these appear so those keywords included

155
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,060
DDoS theft crash virus I chose them

156
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,530
based upon you know the literature I'd

157
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,139
read terms that I thought were likely to

158
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,900
appear of course that's quite biased so

159
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,460
the second analysis I did was to just

160
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,409
look at the articles and say what were

161
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,840
the the most common nouns that appeared

162
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,219
in Italy the scripts and data set

163
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,690
available and github if anyone wants

164
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,370
them come give me a shout after and I'll

165
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,889
point

166
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,400
towards them so the date mining results

167
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,320
were fairly extensive said I've just

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,599
picked a few here for you guys just to

169
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,219
get an overview of what I found but

170
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,590
there was some you know interesting

171
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,470
trends from the 18 pre-chosen keyword

172
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,169
analysis so from the period where those

173
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,320
thousand links came which were produced

174
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,210
at 587 email and phishing was a term

175
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,430
that was commonly found I think that was

176
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,580
probably likely due to the the dnc hack

177
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,020
which happened back in 2016

178
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,659
terms related to psychological

179
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,639
manipulation featured heavily as well

180
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,039
which was probably likely due to the

181
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,320
Cambridge analytic a scandal which was

182
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,130
all across the Guardian and other news

183
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,409
organizations looking at the the common

184
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,250
name a common noun sorry that were

185
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,340
returned

186
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,979
obviously voters voting was was pretty

187
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,109
common security orientated terms such as

188
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,479
cyber security appeared a lot and then

189
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,220
nouns associated with Elections such as

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,169
ballots and referendum and of course

191
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,669
finally which you probably would expect

192
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:47,549
attack attacks hacker and and hackers so

193
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,359
so this kind of told me I was moving the

194
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,479
right direction

195
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,760
you know the term election hacking is

196
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,770
likely to mean

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,219
something to do with a referendum or a

198
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,960
ballot or an election and then common

199
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,300
terms we would generally associate with

200
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,599
you know hacking itself cyber security

201
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,660
and so on

202
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,490
following this you know I I think it it

203
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,650
would be good to look at what the

204
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,120
professionals say with regards to the

205
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,388
types of things that are considered

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,150
cybercrime so the UK Crown Prosecution

207
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:24,930
Service guidelines has to two broad

208
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,909
categories one which is offences that

209
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,680
can only be committed using a computer

210
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,479
so you'd probably think of DDoS being

211
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,190
one of those and then the second of

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,919
cyber-enabled crimes so these are

213
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,469
traditional crimes such as fraud and

214
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,478
money laundering which then leverage IT

215
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:46,410
infrastructure to be able to you know

216
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:48,540
commit the crime so that is my my

217
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,550
foundation I came up with a set of

218
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,810
heuristics you know to see if we

219
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,240
take a group of Acts and apply the

220
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,489
heuristics to it to ask is that election

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,100
hacking or is it something broader you

222
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,570
know is it fraud isn't money laundering

223
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,540
and and the four heretics that came up

224
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,970
with were can does the attack target and

225
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,949
aspect of the election system is it

226
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,600
digital a cyber in nature such as a

227
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,850
cyber dependent crime so that refers

228
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,820
back to the previous slide with the CPS

229
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,769
guidelines does it involve a component

230
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,079
of information security or privacy being

231
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:22,390
breached or broken and then finally it's

232
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,599
not a financial crime I decided to rule

233
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,390
that out because you know it's it's not

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,060
solely a cyber dependent crime that

235
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,420
often they're cyber-enabled and existed

236
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,420
long before we had the Internet as well

237
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,010
so based upon those heuristics I came up

238
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,769
with a model which I've called the hex

239
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,459
ad familiar with the term hex ads the

240
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:48,490
Greek four six and the model has six

241
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,709
edges one for accidental one for

242
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,690
psychometrics one for physical

243
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,699
infrastructure attacks one for denial of

244
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,930
service attacks one for information

245
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,360
based attacks and then finally

246
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,189
exfiltration slash data theft which

247
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,740
actually spells app died if you look at

248
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:07,690
it so having come up with this model it

249
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,880
was like okay I need to define these

250
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,920
attack vectors in more detail so I

251
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,380
merged the results the data sets to come

252
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,089
up with 15 attack examples and then I

253
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,730
applied the heuristics to them to filter

254
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:20,589
out anything that I didn't think fell

255
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,870
within this now defined term election

256
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,880
hacking and the heuristics led to the

257
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,529
following the attack categories you know

258
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,110
things like hitting vote tallying

259
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,670
systems intellectual electoral

260
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,160
infrastructure such as denial of service

261
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,689
attacks against websites stealing emails

262
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,850
of political candidates through phishing

263
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,140
attacks flipping votes on voting

264
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,870
machines so if anyone went to the vote

265
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,130
hacking village it at DEFCON you will

266
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,459
have probably seen plenty of examples

267
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,020
what people were doing with the machines

268
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,810
targeting individuals via online ABS in

269
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,790
propaganda so fake news using stolen

270
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,310
data and then leveraging that as

271
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,490
Cambridge and analytic over-leveraged

272
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,949
alleged to have done through taking data

273
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,690
from the Facebook API

274
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:05,079
dumping stolen data onto the web so

275
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,210
there was a lot of that in 2016 3 2

276
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,890
an eighteen period WikiLeaks is one that

277
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,080
we think of but there's plenty of others

278
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,000
which I'll touch on later and then

279
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,300
spreading fake news via fake news

280
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,530
websites so due to the overlap and

281
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,319
broadness of some of these definitions

282
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,360
these were refactored into their hex ad

283
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,130
which I a previous issue and on the

284
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,770
other slide which is really just a set

285
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,540
of meta categories for describing

286
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,030
describing things so this is the model

287
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,699
which I showed you before and really the

288
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,319
goal is to reduce this attack surface so

289
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,300
we want to we want to try and knock out

290
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,210
some of these vectors or at least shrink

291
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,500
them so I'm going to go through each of

292
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,760
them now briefly and just sort of

293
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,700
describe what's involved in each one so

294
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,050
this is a quote from the peacock report

295
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,590
on lesson learned from the EU referendum

296
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,380
when the original voter registration

297
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,200
website crashed I think any of you

298
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,610
who've worked in architecture or

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,250
software engineering or DevOps will

300
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,140
understand that you know the things

301
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,120
crash and if you don't take a board the

302
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,650
the recommendations through testing then

303
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,420
they're probably going to crash when you

304
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:14,319
get into production and that's what

305
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,610
happens here and then there's you know

306
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,860
multiple things we can group together

307
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,320
under this accidental category so I've

308
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,230
put system crashes in here just failures

309
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,700
are no two coke coke flowed and then

310
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,680
just general infrastructure failures and

311
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,750
and you might think well why does that

312
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,400
count as election hacking that's

313
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,310
accidental that could happen any time

314
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,620
and it's really the the problem is what

315
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,209
stems from it so it often leads to a

316
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,040
loss of faith in the process of the

317
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,320
system which is handling you know

318
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,969
whether it's very telling or actual the

319
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,380
votes themselves and it conditioned

320
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,410
franchise voters so in the case of the

321
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,270
UK voter registration website and I'll

322
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,189
cover that in a lot more detail there

323
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,560
was all sorts of rumors started after

324
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,480
that including from MPs and in the press

325
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,579
to really muddied the waters to

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,310
understand what was going on there and

327
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,690
as I say hey you know these types of

328
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,640
things can be then leveraged by bad

329
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,310
actors to spread further discord on

330
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,670
social media or and you know other other

331
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,040
realms and yeah there we go so the voter

332
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,110
registration website in UK is is the

333
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,719
example which we'll look at in a bit

334
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,820
the next one I want to go to is

335
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,500
psychometrics and for some reason the

336
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,149
graphic has screwed up so Marshall

337
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,839
McLuhan if anyone's familiar with him he

338
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:36,490
was a big media guru and I picked his

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,670
book cover here oh sorry

340
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,410
Rebecca second um because this is an

341
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,959
example of actually but you can't read

342
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,339
of something that went wrong where they

343
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,170
printed the book and it should have said

344
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,450
the medium is a message and it said the

345
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,459
medium is the massage so no one proofed

346
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,440
the book and I promise you this is not a

347
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:59,250
targeted ad to go use the mental health

348
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,120
hackers village massage chair so

349
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,540
psychometrics is commonly known as

350
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,370
targeted advertising or micro targeting

351
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,890
it's efficacies really controversial and

352
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,329
disputed I don't think there's probably

353
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,300
been enough research into whether that

354
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,380
it really works or not there's an

355
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,380
article that came out and the

356
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,200
correspondent earlier this week and it

357
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,970
was about the the new dot-com bubble is

358
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,709
here and it's online advertising and

359
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,529
then the whole article really went into

360
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,959
do online ads work for companies like

361
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,579
eBay because was somebody just going to

362
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,959
go to the website anyway are they paying

363
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,219
lots of money to click for people to

364
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,959
click on an ad for something they were

365
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,970
already going to buy in addition to that

366
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,859
Ethan her shoes I think you still at

367
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,649
Yale he wrote a book called hacking the

368
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,570
electorate this I came across this

369
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,940
actually because there's a guy in the UK

370
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,130
called Dominic Cummings he's a adviser

371
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,750
to the UK prime minister and he was

372
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,630
involved in one of the leave campaigns

373
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,270
during the EU referendum and he was

374
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,040
criticized a lot for using micro

375
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,779
targeted ads and he turned around on his

376
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,160
blog and I believe he said no I didn't

377
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:06,640
use that I actually use more the

378
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,160
mechanisms mentioned or not mechanisms

379
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,520
as such but it the approach he took was

380
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,910
derived from from what was in Ethan's

381
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,589
book if I've got that cracked so it's

382
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,390
worth worth checking out I bought a copy

383
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,560
this week to read through but I haven't

384
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,269
had the chance to do it yet because I

385
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,729
had a production failure yesterday and

386
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:28,750
wiped my whole day out so so the big one

387
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,200
which you've probably all heard of is

388
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,560
Cambridge analytic and

389
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,450
big scandal Chris Wiley who was one of

390
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,599
the employees at Cambridge analytic here

391
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,070
in London he's brought a book it really

392
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,730
provides quite an interesting background

393
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,860
into the structure of the company and

394
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,890
the sub companies and what allegedly

395
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,630
they were doing as I say we don't really

396
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,640
have any metrics in the public for how

397
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,020
successful they are a lot of people are

398
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,250
going to say they were some people say

399
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,050
they weren't I'm pretty sure Alexander

400
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,190
Nick's the guy who ran the company told

401
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,020
everyone they were super successful

402
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,900
because obviously you wanted to make

403
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,689
money but I think you know as it's more

404
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,370
comes out from from that scandal we'll

405
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,890
probably get an idea of exactly what

406
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,370
they were up to up guard if anyone's

407
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,069
heard of them

408
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,510
Chris Vickery he did a lot of research

409
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,330
and this he actually uncovered some

410
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,890
quite fascinating details about

411
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:21,200
aggregate IQ because they left their get

412
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,670
get lab account publicly accessible I

413
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,680
think it was and he was able to get into

414
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,719
it without having to do anything illegal

415
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,870
and and see what they were up to and

416
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,680
found some links between them and

417
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,400
different parts of the leave campaign

418
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,310
which were certainly in a legal gray oh

419
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,410
and then Carroll Cadwallader and channel

420
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:44,119
4 UK they did an under port undercover

421
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,939
report on on Cambridge analytic and

422
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,680
channel 4 sent guys in undercover and

423
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,020
they recorded them talking about some of

424
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,589
the definitely illegal things that we

425
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,300
were planning to do to help throw a

426
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,850
hypothetical election so if you're

427
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,979
interested definitely go read Carroll's

428
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,570
work because she she goes into quite a

429
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,030
lot of detail about what she found out

430
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,790
when she was investigating Cambridge

431
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,730
analytic in that there targeted ads and

432
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,949
then finally and just under the the CI

433
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,839
scandal if any of you have Netflix which

434
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm sure many of you do there's a great

435
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,619
documentary in there called the great

436
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,880
hack which interviews song called

437
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,649
Britain Kaiser she worked for Cambridge

438
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,630
analytical and she goes into detail

439
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,300
about what our role was and what they

440
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,160
were up to but I'm just gonna reiterate

441
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,090
is to say certainly I'm not not a

442
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,210
psychologist so I can't argue you know

443
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,820
academically whether the ads work or not

444
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,020
but it's it's a controversial area and

445
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,860
it should be something everyone's

446
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,720
concerned about because

447
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,149
if the perception is that they work then

448
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,500
every time we have an election or a

449
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,640
referendum or something along those

450
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
lines then people are going to

451
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,690
immediately start saying well someone

452
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,480
used targeted as it threw it so so it's

453
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,220
something that needs more I think

454
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,890
investigation and additionally probably

455
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,390
needs a little more attention from the

456
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,610
platforms that serve the ads to make

457
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,870
sure that everyone knows exactly what

458
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,580
they're being served and from whom it's

459
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,409
coming

460
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,149
the final part that I on the

461
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,640
psychometric slide I want to talk about

462
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,260
is the Russian Facebook Ads so if

463
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,970
anyone's seen those you can go find them

464
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,690
online they're definitely not

465
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,220
sophisticated is the Micra targeted ads

466
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,760
but there's a quite interesting

467
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,500
backstory around those Rene de resto G

468
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,340
if you're interested she did it anyway I

469
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,010
think it was with Sam Harris this year

470
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,799
she talks about how the ads were

471
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,440
basically memes and over the course of a

472
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,179
year the group that was deploying these

473
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,600
memes would change from using Simpsons

474
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,919
means to to other like cartoons until

475
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,689
eventually they would hit something that

476
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
worked and got traction and then they

477
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,350
would keep pushing those graphics on

478
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
Facebook into certain groups to try and

479
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,030
sow discord between different groups of

480
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,290
individuals so for all I know there made

481
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:59,220
me more successful than Cambridge

482
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,649
America oh no here we go that's

483
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,230
certainly worth if you're interesting

484
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:07,230
interested in subject check out and then

485
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,840
finally just to go back to Chris Sumner

486
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,520
which I mentioned earlier he's got a

487
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,309
fantastic talk called rage against the

488
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,150
weaponized AI propaganda machine it's on

489
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:19,500
YouTube it was at DEFCON 25 I believe

490
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,290
definitely go check it out go watch it

491
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,090
he's done some other work as well which

492
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,379
is more like academic in the sense that

493
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,120
you can go download the white papers and

494
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,169
read them if you're interested and then

495
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,760
finally on the subject psychometrics

496
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,799
Oxford University's a computational

497
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,900
propaganda research project is a really

498
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:42,240
fascinating website it's a comprar pax

499
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,010
to a co uk have a look for you there

500
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,590
they have like a junk news aggregator on

501
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,669
there and some other pretty cool stuff

502
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,668
that they've collected off the web

503
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,010
whoo there we go it's bad babe

504
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,960
might be able to read the slides a

505
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:03,800
little better thanks me so so the next

506
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,680
area that in the next edge on my hex ad

507
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,169
was physical infrastructure attacks so

508
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,360
to quote Ted Koppel the internet among

509
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,490
its many many virtues is also a weapon

510
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,959
of mass destruction if you're not

511
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,180
familiar with Ted Koppel he wrote book

512
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,860
called lights out a cyberattack a nation

513
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,180
unprepared surviving northa mass is

514
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,790
about what would happen if there is an

515
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:27,590
attack on the u.s. electricity grid it's

516
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:30,530
frightening stuff so check it out if you

517
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,730
get the chance so physical

518
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,060
infrastructure tax what do we mean by

519
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,640
this

520
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,409
so voting machines are vulnerable the

521
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
DEF CON voting village is shown shown

522
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,280
that if you check out there it takes a

523
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,590
village to hack a voting system talk at

524
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,450
hope there's a lot of background around

525
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,820
the subject Matt blaze

526
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,670
Harry hasty and Margaret McAlpin's works

527
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,350
really fantastic in that area so there's

528
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,560
a lot of questions around how voting

529
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,449
machines are deployed you know what

530
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,899
visibility is there into how they work

531
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,340
is anyone really you know taking the

532
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,500
time to make sure they're secure before

533
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,159
they're deployed so it's an area

534
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,970
certainly that's very very hot at the

535
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,920
moment and I think if you go read mats

536
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,390
Matt's work and so many others there's

537
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,480
there's a lot of those machines probably

538
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,370
should not be deployed in any kind of

539
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,710
production instance if you know what I

540
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,899
mean the next thing is the electricity

541
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,150
grid another infrastructure could be

542
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,670
attacked so I'd mentioned lights out so

543
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,350
really I mean you have to get to the the

544
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,940
voting booths if you can knock out the

545
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,530
electricity or something like that which

546
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,930
thankfully I don't believe happened

547
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,280
you can disenfranchise a lot of votes

548
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,930
because you could shut down the ability

549
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,870
for them to actually go and vote and

550
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:46,220
then the vote of Italian registration

551
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:48,649
websites at DEFCON they the team their

552
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,570
roots Asylum put together some example

553
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,610
website so base them upon some existing

554
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,990
ones and let people loose on on and

555
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,060
they've hit them with sequel injection

556
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,950
attacks and similar so the concern

557
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,020
around this is if you can break into a

558
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,550
vote tally and website or a website that

559
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,389
communicates the results of an election

560
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,129
you can change it and

561
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,718
even if it gets fixed by that time

562
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:08,519
people are going to start rumors on

563
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:09,719
Facebook and another social media

564
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,079
platforms and you're going to have a

565
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:15,149
headache on your hand and of course yeah

566
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,190
infrastructure taxes also mean data from

567
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,988
modification and corruption and removing

568
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,820
voters from the system if you can sneak

569
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:23,609
in and you can delete voters you know

570
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,999
you can try and sway a system one way or

571
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,249
the other

572
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:29,879
so that was the the physical

573
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:32,879
infrastructure attack vector the next

574
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,918
one is the denial of service attacks so

575
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:37,889
I'm pretty sure everyone in his heard of

576
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:42,239
denial of service if you haven't I'll

577
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:44,609
explain a little more detail so a DOS a

578
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:47,729
denial of service attack crashes or

579
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:49,708
denies legitimate access to a target so

580
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:51,539
spam actually you you know you could

581
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:53,549
consider a denial of service attack

582
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,289
because if you fill someone's inbox with

583
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:58,049
junk it becomes very difficult for them

584
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:01,169
to actually find the legitimate email

585
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,969
amongst the noise so what would

586
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,700
especially interested in is the

587
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:08,669
distributed denial of service attacks so

588
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,709
the pings of deaths boost packets syn

589
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,289
floods so this is where you can have

590
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:15,059
basically a botnet or compromised IOT

591
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,440
devices and then the person that

592
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,869
controls them can point them towards

593
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,519
perhaps some you know very registration

594
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:22,199
website for example and just flood it

595
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,019
and knock out offline which once again

596
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,869
results in you know disenfranchising

597
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,489
people because they can't sign up it

598
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,079
doesn't really require physical access

599
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:34,169
IVA or any sophisticated technical

600
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:36,899
skills with regards the infrastructure

601
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:39,419
attacks because a whole bunch of you

602
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:41,099
know compromised machines can be just

603
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,749
handed it and let loose and the

604
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,879
individual behind it could probably get

605
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:47,279
away with it for quite a long time a

606
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:49,829
verse is trying to you know go on site

607
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,089
to say a vote in precinct and break into

608
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:55,678
a variant machine and you know you can

609
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:57,539
knock this software infrastructure

610
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,059
offline as I mentioned voter

611
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,070
registration sites even even hardware if

612
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:05,700
it's connected to the internet so so

613
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:08,129
it's definitely a concern the next

614
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,659
category is the information based

615
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:13,629
attacks so a couple of quotes here which

616
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,460
I thought were quite good

617
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,679
[Applause]

618
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,740
so what do we mean by that so so we're

619
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,929
really interested with information based

620
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,690
attacks which have an origin in digital

621
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,160
and social media is this often

622
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,400
unregulated and it's difficult to trace

623
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,679
the individuals behind it and it's often

624
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,840
unaccountable with a traditional news

625
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,900
organization they have an address they

626
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,030
have you know TV station so some

627
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,240
countries have press oversight

628
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,379
independent like press oversight

629
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,390
organizations so if someone defames you

630
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,610
can write to them and ask them to work

631
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,640
on your bath to have the comment

632
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,750
retracted with fake news you don't know

633
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,220
where it could be it could be in

634
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,840
Macedonia could be in Russia

635
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,760
it could be in Idaho the fake news you

636
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,740
know can involve plagiarizing modifying

637
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,100
other material legitimate material and

638
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,870
reusing it fabricating stories and and

639
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,280
you know include deceptive and

640
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,659
misleading stories so whether you take

641
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,270
something that's true and alter it just

642
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,840
enough one thing that we saw back in

643
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:20,080
2017 was I think it was a Belgian news

644
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,120
site the whole site was copied by

645
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,280
nefarious actors and then tweaked to

646
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,689
present some different stories and

647
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,760
looking at it you wouldn't necessarily

648
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:33,020
know it was wasn't the real real thing

649
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,440
and once you have you know fake news

650
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:39,200
sites you can use data dumping to then

651
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,870
feed information that you've stolen

652
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,630
through to the public one example of

653
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,820
date and dumping was micron leaks they

654
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,920
hacked an email addresses in the 2017

655
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,300
French election and then that

656
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,190
information was dumped out onto the web

657
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,659
to try and you know persuade people to

658
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,890
vote one way or another and it of course

659
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,059
it's picked up by the media and fake

660
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:02,030
media and circled around becomes a big

661
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:03,860
feedback loop bots and fake social media

662
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:06,950
profiles can then be used to employees

663
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,540
messages and so don't sow discord so if

664
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,150
you end up with a site that's posting

665
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:14,178
fake stories on it then you get BOTS

666
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:17,690
online that will take it and regurgitate

667
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,670
them and I've mentioned for the Oxford

668
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,510
News junk news aggregator definitely go

669
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,830
check out there's some really

670
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:27,260
interesting material on there and then

671
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,810
coming to the next category is the the

672
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:35,790
ex

673
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:37,620
tration and data that attacks so how are

674
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,720
these conducted the first thing is a lot

675
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,389
of them come from phishing attacks so I

676
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,670
think the DC leaks happened

677
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,820
the RNC leaks happen through phishing

678
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,050
attacks so you get the email someone

679
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,060
clicks on it and next thing you know

680
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,710
they've compromised the system and

681
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,600
someone can get in and download their

682
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,760
email and then dump it out onto the web

683
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,399
or use it the game you know access to

684
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,560
the system and move laterally through it

685
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,960
of course another threat is insiders

686
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,129
do we count whistleblowers - I mean

687
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,740
that's certainly a controversial subject

688
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,810
the previous slide mentioned Chelsea

689
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,850
Manning and Edward Snowden and I'm sure

690
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,560
you know a lot of people have

691
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,889
conflicting views on whistleblowers in

692
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:20,580
that context at any rate and and what

693
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,170
role they have to play but if they dump

694
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,000
data because they're concerned about

695
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,740
something during an election period and

696
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,730
it has an effect is that something you

697
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,830
know we should be concerned about

698
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,160
there's certainly a question I think

699
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,230
that's contentious and exfiltration

700
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,910
because who happened through you know

701
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,490
breaking into systems unpatched security

702
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,020
holes so it could be using Metasploit or

703
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,020
similar to get into the system and then

704
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,470
don't up the database and spread it then

705
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,350
as I mentioned previously that can then

706
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,120
be combined with fake news sites or

707
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,490
social media bots to then spread that

708
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,620
data so you dump a whole bunch of say

709
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,170
emails from someone's account you make

710
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,060
up a few fake emails put it in there and

711
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,530
then spread that and it becomes very

712
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,179
difficult then to pull out hey what was

713
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,879
the fake email the attackers put in with

714
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,070
the real legit emails and and it was it

715
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,060
goes viral trying to try to rein that

716
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:14,189
back in is incredibly difficult and on

717
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,810
top of that sometimes legitimate media

718
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,430
outlets of course are the ones that are

719
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,879
the recipients of that data that's been

720
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,780
stolen

721
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,190
so the Snowden leaks for example he met

722
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,740
with the Guardian journalists who

723
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,180
believe in Hong Kong and then the story

724
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,560
picked up from there and of course you

725
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,000
know they started to share that

726
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,310
information that he'd provided to them

727
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,810
and then you know cats out the bag damn

728
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,480
and then we've got sites such as

729
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,070
WikiLeaks DC leaks and similar Chelsea

730
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,370
Manning stuff I believe ended up on on

731
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,010
way

732
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,800
he leaks so you know how do we treat

733
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,120
them and they treated as a press and

734
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,270
they treated as a whistleblowing

735
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,120
organization or as I believe recently

736
00:28:51,270 --> 00:29:01,889
they were dubbed a non-state aligned

737
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:05,729
Intelligence Service so it's a and you

738
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,740
know we've got the accusations against

739
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,130
Cambridge analytic here for example that

740
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,809
they exfiltrate data in a gray area from

741
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,330
Facebook and then used it for

742
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:18,030
psychometric targeting so that's another

743
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:22,770
potential vector once you've got the day

744
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:24,240
of what you can do with it so having

745
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,559
said all that and sorry I had to go

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,160
through those fairly quickly because I

747
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:31,379
know I've got only up to an hour here

748
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,150
the that gave me an idea

749
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,580
what do we mean them by election hacking

750
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,720
we've defined this heck sad we've looked

751
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,439
in what we mean by all these different

752
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,110
factors so I came up this it's an attack

753
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,880
failure or breach of data related to or

754
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,770
upon the electoral system that involves

755
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,150
an electronic or cyber element so that

756
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,000
would be my definition of election

757
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,650
hacking based upon mining data from the

758
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,809
press and academia to see how it's used

759
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,030
looking back in history the historical

760
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:58,770
uses of the term hacker and then trying

761
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,540
to come up with a set of heuristics and

762
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:03,210
a model for for what we mean by the term

763
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,830
and I think I think it's a pretty good

764
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,950
definition I'm sure you know does

765
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,879
academics out they would probably take

766
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,650
umbrage with some of the stuff in here

767
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,420
and be great I'd actually be interested

768
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,240
to hear where they differ with my my

769
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:18,559
opinion on it

770
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,450
so real-world examples in fighting back

771
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,550
so examples from the recent past I

772
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:26,270
mentioned brexit I'm sure everyone in

773
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,980
here was familiar with the 2016 election

774
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:33,150
the Netherlands their election was in

775
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,760
2017 and France was in 2017 as well I

776
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,350
think the key difference between the

777
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,270
Dutch in the French elections were

778
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,360
because of everything that happened in

779
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,309
the UK in the u.s. in 2016 going into

780
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,620
the beginning of 2017 people were

781
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:49,530
perhaps a little more cognizant of the

782
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,489
risks they faced in 2017 started to be

783
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,110
more proactive at preventing them so the

784
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,540
UK one

785
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,490
so the Vario registration website this

786
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,320
this was a special interest to me when I

787
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,809
was writing my master's thesis I

788
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,879
actually ended up going through my mp in

789
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:07,950
the UK up to the Cabinet Office level

790
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,400
two to get a response from them on it

791
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,260
and effectively what happened was on a

792
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,530
night I think it was a Sunday night

793
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,650
before the registration closed there was

794
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:23,309
a flood of traffic which took down the

795
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,559
voter registration website and it was

796
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:28,970
largely blamed on a television show that

797
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,470
had happened a debate right before I

798
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,090
guess midnight it was around midnight

799
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,610
when it crashed so a debate it happens

800
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,678
shortly before that result that was a

801
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,199
lot of people went on and signed up and

802
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,980
it just the spike in traffic caused it

803
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,140
to collapse digging into a report that

804
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,210
Parliament put out on aftermath of it

805
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,610
you know there was there was talking

806
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,290
there of Facebook rumors told people all

807
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,270
you need to sign up multiple time so had

808
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:57,000
that contribution contributed it to

809
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,620
crashing certainly there was poor

810
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,660
infrastructure planning I mean that's

811
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,459
just going outside of the realm of

812
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,110
cybersecurity you know that was

813
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,990
obviously not load testing done there

814
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,699
and then was there misinformation and

815
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,460
fake news after the event which then

816
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,710
said when the website crashed oh it was

817
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,390
the result of BOTS so digging through

818
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,640
reams and reams of quite boring

819
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:21,059
documentation and reports and what have

820
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,690
you my general impression is that the

821
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:27,899
website was lacking in certain areas of

822
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:30,900
testing the television show contributed

823
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,030
to an increase in traffic people on

824
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,770
Facebook do to perhaps poorly put out

825
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,168
information on how you register and

826
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,690
start signing up multiple times and then

827
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:41,910
once it crashed there was misinformation

828
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,370
but I'd actually argue some of that came

829
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,290
from the report itself that the MPS

830
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:48,570
didn't really understand what happened

831
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,549
and so there was these you know

832
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,950
accusations or it could have been a DDoS

833
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:54,629
attack from Russia or similar none of

834
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,640
the evidence seems to point that way but

835
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,380
then of course they aren't necessarily

836
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,940
going to release that the Cabinet Office

837
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,030
of the Foreign Commonwealth office or

838
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:06,390
whoever whoever owns it but I think that

839
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,700
does make me you know it reminds me that

840
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,920
even people who would

841
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,510
consider with the best of intentions can

842
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,180
end up accidentally spreading rumors

843
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:20,370
which then can undermine people's belief

844
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:23,490
in you know the system and and how well

845
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,500
it works so if you're interested it's on

846
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:29,070
it's on the UK Parliament website it's

847
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,760
the the peacock report on the the voter

848
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:36,030
registration website crashing so the

849
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,250
next one is the u.s. so the internet

850
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,220
research agency in the GRU these are

851
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,200
both Russian organizations the the

852
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,750
internet research agency I've heard it

853
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,400
referred to as a combination of a

854
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,180
marketing firm and an intelligence

855
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,450
organization and the GRU is is a Russian

856
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,240
branch of intelligence minute a Vegas

857
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,820
tied to their military intelligence um

858
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,150
June of 2016 election my graphics aren't

859
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,149
lighting either there was obviously a

860
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:11,639
lot of talk around Russians attacking

861
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:13,500
the the US election system the result of

862
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,040
looking at like the indictments that

863
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,480
came out from the mullah report and all

864
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,449
the research that was done around like

865
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,610
the date of theft of ence guseva the

866
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:25,589
folk they faked protests organized on

867
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,510
social media I don't know anyone in

868
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,790
here's familiar with that but um Renee's

869
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,770
work who I mentioned earlier it looks

870
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,650
like there was those fake news

871
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,350
organizations that were running on

872
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,790
Facebook we're creating rival groups and

873
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,529
then trying to encourage them to protest

874
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,290
in the same location at the same time

875
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,540
hoping it would all kick off thankfully

876
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,920
it didn't it didn't seem to have been as

877
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,290
bad as they would have hope so I guess

878
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,750
you know from that perspective we can be

879
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,270
thankful but certainly looking through

880
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,340
everything that's come out of the Moller

881
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,960
report and the related indictments

882
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,370
there's a lot of things and now that we

883
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,540
would probably consider election hacking

884
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:03,600
certainly the day of theft the

885
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,940
exfiltration the fake news the bot

886
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,470
networks so so that's why I included

887
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,570
this one over here the the Dutch

888
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:15,750
elections which happened the following

889
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,900
year they as I said there are a lot more

890
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:21,120
on the ball base scrapped vote tally

891
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,170
tallying technology to do two security

892
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,339
affairs

893
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:28,140
and in addition to the election at the

894
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:30,029
time there was also a bit of a

895
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,730
diplomatic spat happening between the

896
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,640
Netherlands and Turkey and all simply

897
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,619
Germany in Turkey at the time so sites

898
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,410
providing information to Dutch voters

899
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,609
were targeted by DDoS attacks allegedly

900
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:47,759
from Turkey so that was definitely an

901
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:51,210
example of from from the hex adder the

902
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,190
DDoS angle and then the second one which

903
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,960
I thought was quite interesting was

904
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,660
WikiLeaks ocean of previous leaks

905
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,299
targeted at the far-right PVV party so

906
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,339
what happened was in the past WikiLeaks

907
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:04,470
had got hold of information and believed

908
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:06,599
there were emails on guard welders who

909
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,180
who's a dutch politician and had leaked

910
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,579
it and then when the dutch elections

911
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,640
came round wikileaks started to promote

912
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:17,309
that information again so we could argue

913
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,720
that that was a another example really

914
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:21,089
of election how can even though the

915
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,859
event had taken place previously it was

916
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:24,770
they were able to use that and amplify

917
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,058
it during during the dutch elections

918
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,319
[Applause]

919
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:32,400
next one is is France

920
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:34,920
so Mekons on marsh party was attacked

921
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,309
the email infrastructure there was

922
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,490
attacked the French actually dropped

923
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:43,859
plans for French overseas voters to vote

924
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:45,959
electronically in legislative elections

925
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,670
due to concerns that had been raised

926
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,150
over the previous years you know and the

927
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,549
risks that such systems face

928
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,010
there was a DDoS attack on said exes

929
00:36:53,549 --> 00:37:00,079
which hosts major French media outlets

930
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:02,970
like Lomond in La Figaro so they I guess

931
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,470
said exes hosts multiple media

932
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,879
organisations so they were kind of a

933
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,700
single point of failure when they got

934
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,470
here when there was a huge fake news and

935
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,200
disinformation campaign launched against

936
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:17,720
the 2017 election interestingly enough

937
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:23,040
the the French have a window between

938
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,660
when the campaigning ends and the

939
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,599
Election Day itself whereas kind of a

940
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,160
news blackout so anyone dumping fake

941
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,780
news in that period might actually find

942
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,308
it's more difficult to get leverage at

943
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,839
last minute as compared to other

944
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,280
countries now I don't suppose you could

945
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,970
probably do that in u.s. because they'd

946
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,530
be first and

947
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:41,040
when questions around that but the

948
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,690
French I guess you know at least be able

949
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,000
to new to some of the effects of it due

950
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,560
to that to that rule around how they run

951
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,410
their elections quite interestingly

952
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,109
Huskie in and back mo did a 2017 report

953
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,299
and this is what they know it you know

954
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,420
there was republishing news from russian

955
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,340
sites such as russia today and Sputnik -

956
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,930
those two are traditional media

957
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,500
organizations in the sense that they

958
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,000
have an address and a physical location

959
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,300
but some of the content on there has

960
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
been accused of being biased they've

961
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,150
drawn conspiratorial and anti system

962
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,820
tropes they promoted a hard right French

963
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,650
identity during so that would be if you

964
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,540
think of left for national and marine

965
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,300
lepen who's the the french far-right

966
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,700
candidate they circulated our

967
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,099
anti-muslim material and they pushed

968
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:35,299
hard left in anti imperialist content

969
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:38,490
certainly if I remember correctly in the

970
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,770
2017 election period in France Mellon

971
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:43,890
Sean was running who tends to be on the

972
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,900
far left of French politics so you know

973
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,509
this whole pushing people into the to

974
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,690
the extremes was I think part of the the

975
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,119
plan that was conceived here there was

976
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,589
hope New Hope's news sites so I meant to

977
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,470
Delhi at the Belgian you say who is less

978
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:59,970
well so they had they literally cloned

979
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,799
it and then ran faking whose off it

980
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,319
until they got shut down that's pretty

981
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,970
clever hacked and then I there was fake

982
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,630
polls as well in order to undermine the

983
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:12,270
credibility of opinion polling ran out

984
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,710
it's really coming to second part the

985
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,880
title my dog is you know how did the

986
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:20,250
authorities fight back so there's a

987
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,869
number of defensive techniques so

988
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:24,030
remember we want to reduce the attack

989
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:25,710
surf is so my graphic on the right which

990
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,710
did load this time you know we've got a

991
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,480
large hex out here and then we sort of

992
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,950
reduced the surface and if possible we'd

993
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,780
like to remove some of the edges during

994
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,009
an election so that we can reduce the

995
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,810
overall attack surface the way we can do

996
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,359
that is a few honey pots and fake email

997
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,430
accounts the French did that and I'll

998
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,290
cover that in a second we could make

999
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,299
sure we just have good infrastructure

1000
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,380
hygiene so patch our equipment and

1001
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,710
software

1002
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:54,270
load test it and pan test it so after

1003
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,859
all you know if someone had done proper

1004
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,280
load testing and taking that information

1005
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:00,720
on board during the UK referendum

1006
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,920
there's a good chance that website

1007
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,779
wouldn't crashed which wouldn't have

1008
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,809
resulted in the fake news being spread

1009
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,250
and wouldn't resulted in MPs then saying

1010
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:10,670
something probably in good faith which

1011
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:13,650
then escalated the situation even more

1012
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,849
we can use you know standard techniques

1013
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,039
for harboring infrastructure and

1014
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:18,750
cleaning the operating system access

1015
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,510
control mechanisms another thing which

1016
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:24,270
is great is is mfa if people have got

1017
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,170
MFA on their accounts so you know there

1018
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,819
might not be technically minded

1019
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,020
individuals they might just be people

1020
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:29,609
working for a political campaign

1021
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,410
it does add the actual layer of

1022
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,900
difficulty in breaking in and stealing

1023
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,759
their emails especially if that

1024
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,960
individuals been part of a previous data

1025
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,640
breach and had a particularly weak

1026
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,119
password and every used across sites

1027
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,839
which of course none of us ever do yeah

1028
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,369
MF 18 at least hope to mitigate that you

1029
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,960
know on the infrastructure side there's

1030
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:52,140
other tools as well web application

1031
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,029
firewalls DDoS mitigation techniques and

1032
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,410
then logging as well to help do an

1033
00:40:54,029 --> 00:41:00,599
analysis after attack encrypting your

1034
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:04,500
data at rest and in transit so that's

1035
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:09,299
always a good good practice training

1036
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:12,059
staff on you know social engineering so

1037
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:13,170
how not to end up in a situation where

1038
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,190
you give things away to someone you

1039
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,950
shouldn't because they're acting as

1040
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:18,329
somebody else and then finally this

1041
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,259
one's probably going to be a little more

1042
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:26,940
controversial is regulating advertising

1043
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,880
or Terms of Service I Twitter just last

1044
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,200
week decided that they were going to ban

1045
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,039
political ads starting I believe at the

1046
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,240
end of this month you could make

1047
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:37,920
depending on where you sit on the

1048
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,109
political spectrum you could even argue

1049
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,410
okay we want the government to regulate

1050
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:45,058
ad ad platforms and ads or you could say

1051
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,038
if you're on more towards the other end

1052
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:49,079
well perhaps the terms of services are

1053
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,980
good enough you know if facebook says

1054
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,109
don't do this

1055
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,819
who can it's their platform at the end

1056
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,049
they can just kick people off regardless

1057
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:56,420
of whether they think is free speech or

1058
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:57,829
not so

1059
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,599
as to say a little more controversial

1060
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:01,010
but but there whether you take a

1061
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,180
government approach or a private

1062
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,339
industry approach I think there are

1063
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,799
mechanisms that can be used there too to

1064
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:08,390
at least dampen some of the fake news

1065
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:11,990
and in the bot networks and what have

1066
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:14,299
you so the the French just come back to

1067
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,970
the French election they used a can call

1068
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:19,970
cyber blending or cyber blurring

1069
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:22,279
strategy which was really a case of

1070
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:26,868
training staff to be alert to phishing

1071
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:28,579
attempts implementing like fake email

1072
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:31,549
accounts so if they get hacked into

1073
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:34,309
there's just junk in there or responding

1074
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,809
to phishing emails with with specially

1075
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:37,549
crafted accounts so you can then start

1076
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:41,119
to track where these emails coming from

1077
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:42,769
so you could do things like basically

1078
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,079
counter insertion them always you're

1079
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:47,240
turning the table on the attackers to

1080
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:48,769
try and figure out where they are the

1081
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,269
implementation of honey pots filled with

1082
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,618
fake documents and using low level

1083
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:53,990
encryption I thought that was quite a

1084
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:56,029
clever idea the hackers then waste time

1085
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,919
and cycles you know and you've got to

1086
00:42:56,029 --> 00:42:59,839
only gotta find them out the time before

1087
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,880
the actually election happens trying to

1088
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,410
crack that encryption to find out that

1089
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:09,079
what they found and I was junk or just

1090
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:12,078
disinformation so just one last point on

1091
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:14,299
on that one as well just the counter

1092
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,859
insertion the wall where I would imagine

1093
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:17,569
and I don't know if there's any legal

1094
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,470
scholars here there's probably some

1095
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:24,079
question around whether that is allowed

1096
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,519
I don't know a French law so I can't

1097
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,619
tell you ever whoever it's permitted

1098
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,720
under under their legal system but I

1099
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:31,970
would imagine that counter insertion of

1100
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,859
malware okay perhaps the people

1101
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:35,720
attacking you aren't gonna go and turn

1102
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:37,038
round to the authorities and say hey I

1103
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,649
got hacked when I was trying to hack him

1104
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,750
but you know if you picked the wrong

1105
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,700
target to count a hack and and it's

1106
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,799
someone who's legitimate I can I could

1107
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,009
see that being a problem so it's gonna

1108
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:53,119
just add that caveat there so thoughts

1109
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:56,240
on the future what can we learn from

1110
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,730
other success stories be proactive not

1111
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,680
reactive I think that's true for any

1112
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,599
area of cyber security when you're

1113
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,549
defending systems you know don't wait to

1114
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,380
be a victim know your enemy

1115
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:07,880
so gathering use intelligence there's

1116
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,619
plenty of open-source intelligence out

1117
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,529
there and then of course

1118
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,589
there's companies that specialize in it

1119
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:17,779
use diversion allusion to your favor so

1120
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:20,180
the use of honey pots something which I

1121
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:22,549
came across wild backwards from the

1122
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,519
Snowden leaks and it was published on

1123
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:27,559
the intercept was GCHQ the British

1124
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,368
signals intelligence organization had

1125
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,109
talked about you know using this idea of

1126
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:34,970
Volusion and magic on the Internet so if

1127
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,670
you think of it like you know basically

1128
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,980
how do I deflect people's attacks and

1129
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,900
how do i push them towards something

1130
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,809
that looks like it's legitimate but it's

1131
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,430
just going to waste their time don't be

1132
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:47,960
afraid of pulling vulnerable equipment

1133
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,879
and reverting to manual means if

1134
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,670
something's broken don't just leave it

1135
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,589
in production if you have to pull vote

1136
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,650
machines and revert to using pen and

1137
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:59,480
paper you know it may be a pain but it

1138
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:02,150
probably is the better solution in the

1139
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,619
long run and as I mentioned turn the

1140
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,210
tables on the attackers there's some

1141
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,890
interesting legal and ethical questions

1142
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,170
around that and then learn from your

1143
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:11,299
failure failure Xandra mediate so I

1144
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:13,700
think regardless of you know which

1145
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:15,769
country you look out over the past three

1146
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,839
years there's a lot of lessons that can

1147
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:20,089
be taken away by any country that's

1148
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:24,200
running in elections and use those two

1149
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:26,029
to be proactive so what other strategies

1150
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,819
might work this is kind of a shameless

1151
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:30,319
shout out for myself using the hex ad

1152
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:32,450
can be a good mechanism for looking at

1153
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,089
risk and signing it to a category once

1154
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,680
categorized an agency or individuals can

1155
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:38,599
then be assigned to address the problem

1156
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,279
by breaking the risk down to small the

1157
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:42,200
problem areas we can attempt to address

1158
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,119
them whilst also providing overall

1159
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,828
coordination on the effort problems

1160
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,180
flowing outside of the hex ad can then

1161
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,890
be assigned to agencies and bodies

1162
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,319
responsible for tackling them for

1163
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:53,089
example money laundering fraud and so on

1164
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:55,400
and that allows us not to muddy the

1165
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:56,808
waters you know for those responsible

1166
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,690
for defending infrastructure or tracking

1167
00:45:56,809 --> 00:46:01,609
botnets whatever it's really about you

1168
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:04,730
know understanding the domain and then

1169
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:06,799
coming up with mechanisms to take other

1170
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,759
problems and hand them off to them to

1171
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:09,380
people who are better suited to

1172
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:12,499
investigate them whilst you concentrate

1173
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:17,420
on your own your specialty so in

1174
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:18,890
conclusion my final thoughts democratic

1175
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,259
systems are increasingly at risk and

1176
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,299
failure to act and - the public's trust

1177
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:25,099
so even if it's

1178
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:26,719
hack is unsuccessful if the press

1179
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,789
reports on it it's gonna immediately

1180
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,429
start to raise questions and people's

1181
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,769
minds free speech will be leveraged

1182
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:37,609
against democracies so as we've seen

1183
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:40,488
with fake news on social media or fake

1184
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:41,839
Facebook groups individuals are going to

1185
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:43,189
use that and they're going to push it so

1186
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,049
really what we can do is just to be

1187
00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:46,549
better educated in critical thinking

1188
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:48,890
when we look at something ask is this

1189
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:51,499
really a true source or is it you know

1190
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,029
some dudes blog in you know some

1191
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:56,569
400-pound dude sitting on his bed in the

1192
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:59,149
basement so I and then something really

1193
00:46:56,569 --> 00:47:01,159
thinks quite interesting is deep fakes

1194
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,618
and other emerging technologies they're

1195
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,609
going to add another dimension so we

1196
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,349
really need to think about how we

1197
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:08,749
counter that now or not wait until

1198
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:10,459
there's a fake video of the next

1199
00:47:08,749 --> 00:47:13,939
president of the u.s. saying something

1200
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:15,589
which they didn't say and then you know

1201
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:17,658
we have to think about it political

1202
00:47:15,589 --> 00:47:20,839
infrastructure faces advanced persistent

1203
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:23,059
threats so in the case of the u.s.

1204
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:24,799
elections we could say that the giu and

1205
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:27,049
the unit's associated with those whether

1206
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:28,880
it's fancy bear and so on you know

1207
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:31,880
that's that's just the nature of the

1208
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,079
beast and on the final point if you're

1209
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,689
still waiting for the capture the flag

1210
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,669
clue hidden in my talk you've missed it

1211
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:41,649
so if you sell all the way through to

1212
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:45,529
this slide you've already missed it oh

1213
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:48,649
no no no just as sources of interest

1214
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:50,869
just to reiterate some of these Chris

1215
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:52,609
summoner's talk go dig thou Chris

1216
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:54,859
Wiley's book is quite interesting

1217
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:56,239
obviously I can't prove his claims in it

1218
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:58,939
but I think if you're just interested in

1219
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,939
the subject please go read it the Oxford

1220
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:03,769
uni comp prop Department which I

1221
00:48:01,939 --> 00:48:06,169
mentioned fantastic there's also online

1222
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:08,868
now the Guardian has lots of articles

1223
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:10,819
the Mueller report the memos indictments

1224
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:13,699
you know a lot of information around the

1225
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:17,329
the Russian operations and what they

1226
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:17,959
were up to you back in 2016 so thanks
