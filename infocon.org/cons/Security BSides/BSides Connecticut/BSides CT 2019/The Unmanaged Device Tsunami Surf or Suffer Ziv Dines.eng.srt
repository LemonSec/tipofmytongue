1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:10,440
okay okay thank you very much

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,420
so it's been a while since in spoken and

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,980
a key University Hall so yeah looks good

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,920
so I'm going to talk to you about the

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,480
tsunami about all of those io T's and

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,939
all of those devices that are a bitch

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,519
forsaken or the people don't think about

8
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:31,859
so let me start with a few really short

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,030
questions and I appreciate it Saturday

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,730
at 3:00 p.m. so try to do my best here

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,219
how many of you believe that there well

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,788
that's not with that how many have a

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:50,129
seem to be at work seem to be okay

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,660
how many of you think the seem to be is

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,949
accurate okay that's a really good

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,809
response so look at it this way if I

17
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,199
would ask the same question ten years

18
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,789
ago I think that about the same number

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,280
of people would say that they have the

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,520
same to be but then most of them would

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,549
say yes we have an amazing CMDB yes we

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,280
have a good seem to be or at least yes

23
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,740
we have some problems but we'll fix them

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,220
we are on a way to fix that thing is

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,798
that the world kind of change sense so

26
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,740
the explosion of those IO T's what's an

27
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:34,290
IOT any examples here ideas what's

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:40,380
what's an IOT device cellphones electric

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:43,560
meter okay yes it is yeah that projector

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,750
exactly that projector that yeah that's

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,790
not a small TV it's not the TV but yeah

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,680
actually I've seen some of those smart

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,450
boards that have the cameras on both

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,079
sides right that you could just capture

35
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,820
what's on that same thing any but these

36
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,009
are just you know these are office

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,960
environment or electrical environments

38
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,610
what about your innovator what about

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,350
your HVAC system what about what's the

40
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,080
funkiest thing I've seen lately

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,540
that actually connects home anybody

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,540
heard about the fishtank example

43
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,300
medical care everything is an IOT

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,540
whatever whatever you touch is an IOT

45
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,200
fishtank

46
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,980
so as you see I have a presentation I

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,869
have many slides III hate slides so I'll

48
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,660
go through some sites do but I hate

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:41,239
slides when you look at there was a

50
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,810
there was a casino in Vegas that had

51
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,940
what still has it a huge aquarium with

52
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,630
lots of amazing fish lots of expensive

53
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,269
fish in gorgeous dish and this fish had

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,630
a small sensor that was supposed to

55
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:00,680
measure how hard to what was right

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:04,870
that's really important measurement okay

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,870
how much you think that sensor cost

58
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,069
yeah I'm five bucks ten bucks you know

59
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,660
something something you'd get from eBay

60
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,250
I'm sure the casino said they didn't get

61
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,540
him from eBay so they pay fifteen sort

62
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,000
of five that's fine they connected it to

63
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,578
the guest Network because Fisher gets

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,260
our guests and and they had to connect

65
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,670
it because that's how those fish where

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,679
I'm sorry that that's how the head

67
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,048
sensor connected to the Internet

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,269
okay and there was a hole knock

69
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:38,090
somewhere in China I don't know where

70
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,760
this that was actually monitoring them

71
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,340
and that water and made sure that the

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:51,200
fish will still be alive

73
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:53,570
what do you think happened so usually

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,339
when I tell the story somebody would say

75
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,380
fish tag is the nice thing that that's

76
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:06,320
usually somebody would say did the fish

77
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:07,820
burn no the fish did not burn what what

78
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,190
happened I actually went to see that

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,799
aquarium like the fish are okay what

80
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:16,418
actually happened there was that

81
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,500
somebody came with his cell phone and

82
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:24,109
connected the tiny computer to that and

83
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,470
used Bluetooth in order to connect to

84
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,540
that $5.00 sensor now

85
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,070
it got now this $5 em so you might

86
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,960
imagine doesn't really have too many

87
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,490
security features right I mean it's a

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,430
sensor it protects fish so connected via

89
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,470
bluetooth nobody cares about that was in

90
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,890
the network was what was in the fish

91
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,840
tank

92
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,300
then from there he went into the guest

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,280
network from the guest network he went

94
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,170
into the corporate network because

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,820
that's what people do nowadays you know

96
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,350
the distinction between guest and

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,490
corporate network is just for show if

98
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,680
you know what you're doing takes two

99
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:02,930
five minutes and got into the database

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,550
and got all the lists like the one thing

101
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,680
that the casino has that's the most

102
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,930
expensive thing which is the list of its

103
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,750
high waters okay you can google it later

104
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,760
true story so fishtank $5 devices

105
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,440
everything that explodes in the world so

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,500
yeah I don't have some slide so let's

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,390
just go to some examples here it's smart

108
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,090
office right looking at all the devices

109
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,780
in your office how do you know if your

110
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,489
printer is malicious why do you care

111
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,469
same thing like same thing like anything

112
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,360
else right if the printer is doing

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,250
something wrong it will get into your

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,110
network and will get to wherever the

115
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,810
most important value but whatever things

116
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,040
is not to mention if you really need to

117
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,200
print something and it doesn't work

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:52,070
that's not good hospitals right health

119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,240
care that's where it becomes just not

120
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,010
funny right

121
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,110
so when you're looking at patient

122
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,480
monitors and we're looking at infusion

123
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,050
pumps right these are true examples that

124
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,030
happens in hospitals in the US so when

125
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,320
you look at a monitor you know just

126
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,929
think about the possibilities here

127
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,150
I mean monitor saves lives right it will

128
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,370
give you an alert when somebody when

129
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,070
somebody needs attention that's not

130
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,850
funny anymore so what happens if that

131
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,669
monitor just doesn't alert what happens

132
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,860
if it's a I don't know a famous person

133
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,260
and that monitor instead of what

134
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,940
monitoring would just send all the vital

135
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,980
information to someone in the cloud

136
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,110
right privacy issues infusion pump in

137
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,520
other I mean it is a funny story now

138
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,659
because the patient is actually alive

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,239
and well but

140
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:47,379
again true story there was an infusion

141
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:49,119
pump that was connecting to a person and

142
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,699
that person was not in a good state and

143
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,819
that infusion pump was compromised and

144
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:58,059
it was discovered that is compromised

145
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,369
but they couldn't take it off because it

146
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:02,169
was actually really important

147
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:03,519
so they actually for a whole week like

148
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,909
they literally didn't know what to do I

149
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,009
mean taking it off is bad keeping it is

150
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,539
well bad too because you don't know

151
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,689
what's going to happen they actually had

152
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,579
the nurse 24/7 looking at that person

153
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,289
with that infusion but not have really

154
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,469
known did not want to be in that

155
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:22,779
person's family there was a nurse 24/7

156
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:25,179
sitting there in making sure that the

157
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,429
patient doesn't deteriorate because of

158
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:32,138
that infusion time that they didn't know

159
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:36,279
what's going to do okay left one of

160
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:40,329
those robotic arm industry ot

161
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:42,610
environment all of the all manufacturing

162
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:45,610
things and at have a few like funnier

163
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,050
examples about manufacturing later but

164
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,029
all of our everything that's being

165
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,839
manufactured works in a protocol called

166
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:55,139
SCADA anybody here know SCADA that's

167
00:07:52,839 --> 00:08:00,579
actually a lot for that question okay

168
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:02,619
SCADA is well old right there are

169
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:05,199
several protocol where there are million

170
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:07,329
protocols inside SCADA some of them on

171
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,069
you or some of them are older but when

172
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,169
you look at the factory most of them

173
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,360
have older equipment because guess what

174
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:16,959
it's really expensive to replace that

175
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,699
equipment and 20 years ago not to

176
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,189
mention 50 years ago but 20 years ago

177
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,239
when you create when manufactured a

178
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:26,949
million dollar worth of a and an away

179
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:29,409
manufacturing machine nobody cared about

180
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,569
security wasn't didn't existent

181
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,818
nowadays the newer things would have

182
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:37,058
newer protocols that are encrypted that

183
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:39,068
have lots of interesting things you can

184
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:42,009
actually look at the automobile industry

185
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:44,589
as the evolvement of those machines

186
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:47,139
right anybody knows what happens when

187
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:52,949
you any cards you're using when you hit

188
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:52,949
on the brake yeah what

189
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,980
[Music]

190
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,890
exactly exactly

191
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,990
it's literally like like the day the

192
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,689
petal itself doesn't do anything it just

193
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,850
it just triggers a command it's not

194
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,279
SCADA because it's car doesn't matter

195
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,230
but it's the same idea right just

196
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,540
trigger the command and then something

197
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,900
breaks who protects that well they're

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,130
companies that do that that's not us but

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,500
but that's leave or when things they are

200
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:29,689
way more encrypted when way more

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:33,990
protected okay a few numbers few numbers

202
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,510
look at those numbers of devices green

203
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,240
device and just going from 2010 to 2020

204
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,450
one I have numbers for 2025 and 2030

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,130
this is actually a gardener grass the

206
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,279
green is what we call the normal devices

207
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,460
okay

208
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,010
normal devices increase obviously things

209
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,170
evolve but not too much normal devices a

210
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,410
big computers PC servers things like

211
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,150
that you know in normal growth then you

212
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,060
have all of your BYO these laptops

213
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,949
tablets smartphones I'm not that old but

214
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,510
when I was in college nobody had the

215
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,220
laptop nobody could afford I mean we had

216
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,040
laptops nobody could afford it there was

217
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,750
like nothing there and two years later

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
everybody came to class with a laptop

219
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,339
right I mean I guess it's the same thing

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,850
now same thing now all of that is

221
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:25,280
exploding

222
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:25,280
but IO T's 25 billion devices in 2021

223
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:33,839
they're talking about a trillion devices

224
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:36,360
by 2030 a trillion from 25 billion which

225
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,070
by itself is crazy all of those devices

226
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,190
are unable

227
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,800
so when you're looking at 10 years ago

228
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:46,440
again in any n 10 years not 100 not 20

229
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,599
not 50 10 years ago 5 years ago when

230
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,660
people talk about protecting networks

231
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,709
protecting devices usually the next word

232
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:59,420
that came was agents right how many of

233
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:01,079
you have agents on their laptops at work

234
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,110
ok make sense

235
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,870
every corporate it basically means hey I

236
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,000
work in a corporate right every

237
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,810
corporate would have you know one agent

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,610
to agent 25 agents whatever it is for

239
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,239
different purposes that would protect

240
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,470
your computer better or worse whatever

241
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,980
that's fine but would protect your

242
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,010
computer you can put any agents of those

243
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,930
if we're looking at that correct

244
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,910
projector right there you cannot but you

245
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,170
cannot put an agent on that that's what

246
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,339
we like to call the ungettable device

247
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,719
great those are devices that you cannot

248
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:44,570
put agents on 95% of the devices by 2025

249
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:50,579
are going to be an agent over okay

250
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:53,280
before we go to that I am from so again

251
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,050
my name is live I hope a it's got a bit

252
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,240
of your attention with all kinds of war

253
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,420
stories I have many more to continue

254
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,190
with I'm from Armas and I'm heading

255
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,560
solution architecture in the East Coast

256
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,660
and strategical accounts that means that

257
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,250
and we'll talk later about what we do

258
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,410
and why we're doing I just want you to

259
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:15,110
remember one thing as I continue my

260
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:18,120
story what we do is listen to traffic

261
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,950
with any story that I continued that I

262
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,350
continue saying and telling you about

263
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,650
think about the fact that every device

264
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,300
that I'm talking about cannot have agent

265
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:30,209
every device that I'm talking about has

266
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,150
traffic we listen to the traffic and

267
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,550
give protection any examples that I'm

268
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,470
going to give towards the end there will

269
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,229
be ok what we would have done any

270
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,780
differently then the reason I'm saying

271
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,030
it now we're not waiting to the end is a

272
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,850
short story like to tell you I like to

273
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,480
tell you those things why did they join

274
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,120
arms what great place to work at but

275
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:58,350
beside that I used to work for five

276
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,660
years in a small startup that was in the

277
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,630
telecommunication completely not cyber

278
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,719
had nothing to do with cyber and we were

279
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,360
managing cellular antennas ever thought

280
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,890
about here at the cellar antennas around

281
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,480
wherever you are right there are so many

282
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,589
of them some of them are hidden low tech

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,680
trees some of them are way too obvious

284
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,430
8%

285
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:27,469
of the power consumption in the world is

286
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:29,550
cellular antennas 8% yeah that's crazy

287
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,309
the reason I'm saying that that my old

288
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,099
company used to do managed capacity of

289
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,110
the antennas and saving energy my pitch

290
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
used to be hey if you're going to deploy

291
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,279
us all over the world

292
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:46,980
we will save 10,000 Niagara Falls a year

293
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:51,089
okay my point is I had a project in

294
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,670
Indonesia and I went to Indonesia and I

295
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,490
needed to connect to their networks go

296
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,498
into the main part of their corporate

297
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,089
network that actually manages the

298
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:02,519
antennas we won't get into all the

299
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,129
details there but just to that one place

300
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,730
from which I can power off and manage

301
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:14,059
all the antennas in all of Indonesia and

302
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,059
I needed a VPN could you give me a VPN

303
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,980
anybody to that one server that can

304
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:28,319
power of all the attainers in your

305
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:31,589
country so I I can tell you that some

306
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:34,800
American companies did give me vpm but

307
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:39,540
wouldn't tell you which ones but to go

308
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,949
back to Indonesia they would they didn't

309
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,300
want to give me a VPN I flew to

310
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:47,300
Indonesia I met with the CTO of one of

311
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,269
the biggest Indonesian several companies

312
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,248
in three bottles of wine later he signed

313
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:57,929
a document saying ok you can get a you

314
00:14:53,249 --> 00:15:00,059
can get a VPN ok two-story so why am I

315
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,519
telling all of that story well we

316
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:06,299
started walking with this with this

317
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,100
network and and we powered off those

318
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,009
antennas we did whatever we needed a

319
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,160
week later we discovered that by

320
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:19,639
accident we actually powered off also

321
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,639
all the cameras in that building

322
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:28,100
by accident connected to the network who

323
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,920
knows where it goes where it continues

324
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,709
so that's when I came back and said okay

325
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,149
I need to switch to a different place to

326
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,799
where we actually protect from those

327
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,480
things that's another example of

328
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,829
something that we would have done better

329
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,399
and protect from that would have been

330
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:46,099
discovered in like five minutes okay 84%

331
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:48,889
of security professionals believe that

332
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,649
IOT s are more vulnerable than computers

333
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:57,290
I should have asked you first before

334
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:59,959
saying 84% but okay enterprises have

335
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:03,949
experienced IOT security incidents just

336
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:07,219
like I've said before and 74% believe

337
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:08,899
that they have in adequate security for

338
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,670
IOT s okay

339
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:17,089
showing some numbers here cyber attacks

340
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,160
on IOT devices surged by 300% don't you

341
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,970
like this big slides of you know scaring

342
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,868
you about something

343
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:27,980
and Microsoft ones Russian hackers can

344
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:31,970
breach secure networks okay anybody

345
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,199
heard about those guys strontium or I'm

346
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:38,239
sure it's pronounced differently because

347
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:44,839
it's in Russian nobody okay this is a

348
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:47,410
Nash nation nation nation-state this is

349
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,839
a group backed by the Russian government

350
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,249
everything that I'm saying now is not a

351
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,869
top-secret whatever this is

352
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:58,699
was actually published by Microsoft so

353
00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:01,850
the Russians are really good at doing

354
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:05,388
those things and you might think okay so

355
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,909
there are against these governments so

356
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:09,829
not to get into which ones but against

357
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,850
this government so what do I care or

358
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,760
what can I do about it

359
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,049
well according to the statistics twenty

360
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,939
percent of what they did was actually

361
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:21,559
intended against governments around the

362
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:25,519
world 80 percent was not true story

363
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:28,730
anybody knows who Mondelez is really

364
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:33,260
nobody knows their name anybody knows

365
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,770
who or what Oreo is come on motive in

366
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,090
the

367
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:41,450
or yours come on the cookie yeah okay

368
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:43,309
Mondelez makes Oreos they actually made

369
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,260
they make like half of the chocolate in

370
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:52,428
the world okay in all kinds of other

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:54,260
snacks and whatnot in 20 I want to say

372
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:58,640
2015 might have been a year or two

373
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:01,580
before after Mondelez was attacked who

374
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,730
the tech chocolate makers and they make

375
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,919
chocolate they they're specifically a

376
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,140
factory that they own was attacked and

377
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,600
it's only problem was or the reason that

378
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,790
it was attacked supposedly at this

379
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,500
Factory has the misfortune to be placed

380
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:21,070
in the Ukraine now they they have over a

381
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,980
hundred factories around the world and

382
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:28,159
that factory was in Ukraine was attacked

383
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:31,240
you know globally and that Factory was

384
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,820
one of them and if you can google later

385
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,460
wanna cry attack in Mondelez or Mondelez

386
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,490
Ukraine or any other combination of that

387
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,110
you will see that ok public record it

388
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,690
got into their new queen factory it

389
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,760
close it shut down the Ukraine factory

390
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,960
can you just imagine if like there's no

391
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,850
more Oreos in the world it was the globe

392
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,920
they didn't manufacture Oreos in that

393
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,280
Factory I don't know what exact type of

394
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,340
chocolate they made but can you imagine

395
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,300
the world shortage of that specific type

396
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:08,590
of chocolate because somebody attacked a

397
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:11,840
chocolate factory in the Ukraine okay

398
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:17,990
that was one of mine anybody knows wanna

399
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:23,750
cry oh that's actually nice okay doesn't

400
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:28,040
wanna cry exist anymore okay so if you

401
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,200
go to frankly if you go to manufacturers

402
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,590
if you talk to the sea to the sitios of

403
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,350
the sea sauce and you kind of mention

404
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,059
the word wanna cry they would knock on

405
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,330
wood they would jump three times they

406
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:45,110
would hide under the chair like

407
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,850
everybody is really afraid of that and

408
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,229
the reason is it's it's kind of like the

409
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:53,870
plague

410
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:57,770
it's was supposed to be radical about

411
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,959
two years ago and yet we keep seeing

412
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,879
that again and again and again I was

413
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,620
actually doing a POC with this company I

414
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,270
wouldn't say that company's name but I

415
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,719
was doing a POC with the company

416
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,000
just last month and we were installed we

417
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,270
started really small in a tiny lab that

418
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,360
they had somewhere and like five minutes

419
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,970
into being there hey you ever wanna cry

420
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:24,289
and the lab manager literally went under

421
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:28,610
a chair when I said that okay

422
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:32,059
so let's get a bit in depth you know

423
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:36,889
we're not too much but in depth into one

424
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:38,149
of the more interesting attacks and the

425
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,179
reason I say it's more interesting is

426
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:43,428
that actually we Thomas discovered that

427
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:49,270
specific vulnerability and I'm about to

428
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,270
talk about so who knows what vxworks is

429
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:58,158
higher like really

430
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:59,928
okay very good is the most okay let me

431
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,640
ask differently what is the most common

432
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:11,779
operating system in the world right now

433
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:14,029
exactly yeah sorry about that so I was

434
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,890
shocked when I heard that and when we

435
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:18,559
start with that I mean know what's the

436
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:23,390
most no operating system Windows Linux

437
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:26,480
don't want to get into that site I'm I

438
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,220
have a Mac but I don't know Android iOS

439
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,919
for that matter you know whatever it is

440
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:35,350
so no but not not even close

441
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:38,750
okay so there are over two billion

442
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:42,590
devices that are running vxworks VxWorks

443
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:44,630
is a actually over to two billion

444
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,459
devices that are running older version

445
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,990
of VxWorks they're over 10 billion

446
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,110
devices that are running fix works right

447
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,110
now

448
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,750
Vic's box is a simple operate and

449
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,559
amazing yet simple operating system that

450
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,010
literally everything that's an IOT has

451
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,530
so

452
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:08,270
projector I really don't know but most

453
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,670
likely is running vehicles all of your

454
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:15,620
printers are running VxWorks all of your

455
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:20,480
Xerox machines fridges lots of switches

456
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,929
by the way and a lot a lot more we'll

457
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,740
get into that so

458
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:30,110
Forbes when was that July 29th published

459
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,700
that the reason this is July 29th is

460
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,709
that we or every year we published some

461
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,040
new vulnerabilities that we found before

462
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:41,060
blackhat everybody does that

463
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:44,750
so that's when that came in two billion

464
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,540
IOT devices that got the critical object

465
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,740
now critical object now means well that

466
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:54,139
it is critical and it should update

467
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:56,390
right now and then we're going back to

468
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,990
the medical part look at those devices

469
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,930
anybody recognize those all kinds of all

470
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:05,840
kinds of medical pumps there right that

471
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,820
is also running vxworks okay because

472
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,990
again there's they're simple and sure

473
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,480
they're doing amazing things but your

474
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,630
simple i of T's right running the same

475
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,260
thing decade old code is putting

476
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:20,560
millions of critical devices at risk

477
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,750
okay so let's forget a bit into that

478
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,520
debt vulnerability and this is what this

479
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,040
is one ability that we came with it's

480
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,810
called urgent 11 anybody knows why

481
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,840
anyway that's how anybody heard about

482
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,970
urgent 11 okay

483
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,350
not too many okay that's well it's bad

484
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,170
for us but it's good because you won't

485
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,000
be bored

486
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:51,280
anybody knows why of those who knows it

487
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:55,670
why it is called urgent 11 so sorry

488
00:23:51,280 --> 00:24:01,010
it's what Oh excellent now now it's it's

489
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:04,280
action hmm no no it's actually it's a

490
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:10,300
combination of eleven vulnerabilities so

491
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,300
urgent 11 now marketing guys so

492
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,330
so what does it actually do so if we

493
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,780
look at any type of device or IOT for

494
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,689
that matter

495
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,600
there are basically three layers we have

496
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,850
the physical layer which is the Ethernet

497
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,980
port itself or Wi-Fi for that matter

498
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,139
we'll call that a layer then there is

499
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,510
the network stack layer which is the

500
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,400
network and transportation so basically

501
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,190
everything that runs in the network and

502
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,160
then we have the application layer which

503
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,020
is well the application the layer of the

504
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,750
application okay everything that's in

505
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,770
the actual code right that will run at

506
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,840
the application if something is a

507
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,450
vulnerability in the physical layer it

508
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,939
is really bad because then you need to

509
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,720
replace the actual cables I mean that's

510
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,690
that's crazy

511
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,960
if anything happens in the application

512
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:04,270
level then then it's usually a patch

513
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,490
right because okay there is something

514
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,610
wrong with the code it will impact

515
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:11,560
something very specific right so you

516
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,000
just protect that it's usually easier

517
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,830
and you'd usually have different layers

518
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,950
that would protect you from that so

519
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,379
urgent 11 is in the network layer

520
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,110
meaning that meaning that if a device is

521
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,150
vulnerable to urgent 11 all the attacks

522
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,610
will happen through the network layer it

523
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:31,590
means that it runs through all of your

524
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:34,750
firewalls so let me say that again

525
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,889
traffic that goes through the firewall

526
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,260
without stopping

527
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:41,350
isn't that what 5 was a 4 to stop

528
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,340
traffic going from A to B well not at

529
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:48,300
the urgent 11 so basically and I won't

530
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,100
get into all the sub versions whatever

531
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:55,090
many versions of VxWorks

532
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,610
are vulnerable to that over 2 billion

533
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:01,360
devices in the world and the whole idea

534
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,340
is that attackers are bypassing security

535
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,860
traditional security is just a fancy

536
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,659
name for firewall so what bypassing

537
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,320
firewalls and just going through that

538
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,410
and get into the devices so if there is

539
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,020
one device that is vulnerable inside

540
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,640
your network an attacker can go through

541
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,460
the firewall get into that device and

542
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,080
spread all over the network as simple or

543
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,520
alarming as that

544
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,230
so what is impacted well I said that

545
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,780
everything that has the Xbox right but

546
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,700
everything that is SCADA oriented all

547
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,129
the in just all the industrial

548
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,490
controllers all over the world patient

549
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,549
monitoring MRI machines firewalls VoIP

550
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,910
phones printers have some list of

551
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,918
manufacturers I'm allowed to put it all

552
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,720
here because we actually announced it to

553
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,230
them a few months before we published it

554
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,820
to the world right and there actually

555
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,789
and this is the story of how we did that

556
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:01,860
so look at that this actually happened

557
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:03,530
at Def Con last year so I think it was

558
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,510
definite

559
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:10,320
it's biohacking village that's what it

560
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,059
was so our CTO stood there you don't see

561
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,360
him on the picture but that was right

562
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,360
there and he was sitting with the CTO of

563
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,399
Alerus and that's why we're showing

564
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,860
their logo right there I mean true story

565
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,140
he was sitting right there and he told

566
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,459
him let me show you something and it

567
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:35,039
took his laptop and broke into the

568
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,929
device and like five seconds and just to

569
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,700
show that he broke into it see what it

570
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,070
and don't see it really well but here on

571
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,919
the zoomed in picture it says

572
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,950
communication error so basically took

573
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,490
him five seconds to make this medical

574
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:53,450
device stopped working and that device

575
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,740
was a new device that was shown in that

576
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,659
you know in that biocking village I mean

577
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,539
it was the newest latest whatever they

578
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,539
had in five seconds communication error

579
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,669
then we came into the into the hospitals

580
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,049
and announced it to everybody we

581
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,750
actually took I think it's three months

582
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:16,530
between telling them and announcing to

583
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:19,980
the world we worked with the FDA and DHS

584
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:22,889
and with Alerus before the announcement

585
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,780
and made sure that everybody is aware of

586
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,760
that and that the on the day that we

587
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,280
announced that they would actually have

588
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,200
a patch already ready for that right not

589
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:37,230
just start making the patches then but

590
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,740
so the vulnerability is only VxWorks and

591
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,010
then it became a bit interesting so two

592
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:47,370
weeks after that there is a big hospital

593
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:49,650
chain that we work with and we came to

594
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,120
them and said hey you know you have us

595
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,059
installed and said yeah we're very happy

596
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,129
with you and we said so this is the list

597
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,200
of all of your devices that are

598
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,240
vulnerable to urgent 11 please go ahead

599
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,960
and you know patch them because it's all

600
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,670
dangerous and we like to do that on a

601
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,210
Friday so that way they have to work on

602
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:12,920
the weekend and only for those we want

603
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:15,929
them we want to work on the weekend so

604
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,809
we did that and then the next day

605
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:20,280
Saturday we get a usually like to you

606
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,200
know call us back the next day ins

607
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,200
during the weekend because we started I

608
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,270
guess you know what white so the colors

609
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,050
back Saturday and they call shenanigan

610
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:34,320
and they said this device right here

611
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:39,090
that you say this vulnerable is not and

612
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,100
we said hmmm why I mean you know we

613
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,770
found the urgent 11 we're kind of good

614
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,209
at saying who is fundable and who is not

615
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,740
nobody else knows anything about it

616
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,990
because we just came out with that so

617
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,679
why are you saying that said well we

618
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:55,980
contacted the the manufacturer of that

619
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,770
device and they said that this device

620
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,570
does not use feet folks so therefore

621
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:04,860
it's not vulnerable and literally

622
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:08,040
culture Nanga was not a good weekend I

623
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:11,040
can tell you that it was noon right so

624
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,830
kind of okay maybe we have a bug in that

625
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,070
mechanism that discovers the devices or

626
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,889
anything else I mean you know make sense

627
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:22,649
so we came back and so we actually

628
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,710
checked it out verified then came back

629
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:28,530
and said okay we found a problem

630
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:33,840
actually urgent 11 is way bigger than

631
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:35,970
what we thought VxWorks bought some I

632
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,889
mean many companies throughout its life

633
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,500
20 years ago they bought a different

634
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,450
company that I won't say its name but

635
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:46,290
they bought a different company the bug

636
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:50,010
actually started at that company

637
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:52,950
so all of the older devices that do not

638
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:55,050
use VX works just use that company

639
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,290
before it was bought by VX works

640
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:03,090
actually also have that bug and that was

641
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:05,010
that medical device yeah so it keeps

642
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,169
expanding actually every month since

643
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:11,129
that summer we found some unpublished

644
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:14,550
some more things that came in with

645
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,650
urgent eleven so you can go to a website

646
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:19,290
I'm not done yet but you can go to a

647
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,270
website and see all of those reports and

648
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,610
patches and everything about urgent

649
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,770
eleven it's really fascinating when you

650
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,810
get into that and see some more things

651
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:31,050
and the interesting part is that it's

652
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:33,780
not it's it's you know it's everyday

653
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:38,070
it's everything that we touched every

654
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:42,840
day that is vulnerable to that okay so

655
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:45,000
let's continue with a few other examples

656
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,750
here so we talked about wanna cry right

657
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,210
and run a cry for chocolate so what

658
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:56,250
about wanna cry for MRIs true story so

659
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,130
all of this okay I didn't look at this

660
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,110
right the reality of real IOT what

661
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,090
actually lays behind that is real

662
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,350
customers of ours okay so all the

663
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,209
stories that I'm telling you now and not

664
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:11,010
things that I read on Google that are

665
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:12,810
actually our customers MRI machines that

666
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,150
are connecting to the internet who knows

667
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:20,970
what is running on what operating system

668
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:29,280
is running on MRI come on it's only it's

669
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:31,230
on the slide Windows XP Windows XP MRI

670
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,250
machines are actually pretty old

671
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,900
computers that have amazing things

672
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,740
connected to them right

673
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,570
being an MRI machine but from the you

674
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,550
know from our point of view it's it's a

675
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,419
Windows XP machine that's what it is

676
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:49,919
so you don't have to tell you how

677
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,890
uncatchable or and how vulnerable

678
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,980
Windows XP is being so old right not to

679
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,980
get into Linux windows things just being

680
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,289
that all more than

681
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,779
it's under warranty it cannot be patched

682
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:08,200
unless it is patched by the manufacturer

683
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:09,940
you can you know I actually went to one

684
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,110
of the hospitals and say you know I'm

685
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,720
pretty ignorant there

686
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:17,350
why can't you upgrade the damn windows

687
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:20,620
XP I mean why said what we can it's the

688
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,939
FDA not approved actually doing anything

689
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,279
everything that you do in a hospital has

690
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,630
to be FDA approved right a manufacturer

691
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,620
approved and I said where we can't we

692
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,230
can't do anything about it

693
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,178
okay having said that that MRI MRI

694
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,299
machine is connected to the manufacturer

695
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:36,539
in order to get updates yeah bit of an

696
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:39,009
oxymoron there but anyway it is

697
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,360
connected to the Internet Windows XP do

698
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:43,120
I need to tell you what what's going on

699
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,240
when that happens right

700
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,939
so when equai got into the hospital got

701
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,929
into that MRI machine started connecting

702
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:55,019
to anywhere in the environment using SMB

703
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:59,049
protocol and infected everything around

704
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:00,190
okay I told you I don't like slides so

705
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:03,250
I'll tell you a different story about an

706
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:06,340
MRI which is not on the slide another

707
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:09,250
true story this is in hospital and I

708
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:14,859
won't say where but it's say that's

709
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:16,540
quality cost and what they did was where

710
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:17,949
I started with a lack we discovered it

711
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,359
throughout the story but I'll tell you

712
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:24,609
what actually happened so this lady did

713
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,799
they found her like I know her name this

714
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:31,540
lady was bored one night at 2:00 a.m.

715
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,280
and she wanted to go on Facebook I said

716
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,310
she was on hospital and she wanted to go

717
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,500
on Facebook I don't know why I guess she

718
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,918
doesn't have a phone or a tablet or

719
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:44,800
whatever and she had to do it from a

720
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:52,598
computer and she had to choose the MRI

721
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:55,290
machine to go on Facebook I really want

722
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:59,100
to meet her and

723
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:00,900
so she went to that MRI no MRIs are

724
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,490
connected to the metal of that MRI

725
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,980
anyway it's connected to the network

726
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:09,689
using Wi-Fi I don't know why and she

727
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,840
went to that and you know literally you

728
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:17,340
know facebook.com and Amy didn't work

729
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,750
you know why with somebody to this job

730
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,840
within that hospital and it had a

731
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,480
firewall that in other solutions and

732
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:28,470
whatnot that basically you know point

733
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,630
where that segmented the medical network

734
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,540
into you know so you can go on Facebook

735
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,040
kind of make sense and I'm all into

736
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,420
network segmentation it's an amazing

737
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,640
thing it's not good enough but it's

738
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,320
really good so she was so so so she was

739
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,170
really she really wanted to go on

740
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:51,570
Facebook at that 2 a.m. so she changed

741
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:53,100
the wireless network to Starbucks it's a

742
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:58,380
hospital heavy Hospital has a Starbucks

743
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,100
right so now we have a Windows XP

744
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,710
computer

745
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:05,910
oh excuse me MRI machine connected to

746
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:07,380
stop so she spent about half an hour

747
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:09,089
this is all what we found in the logs

748
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,120
she spent about half an hour doing

749
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,400
whatever she did on Facebook then she

750
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:17,839
was was really good about it she

751
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,700
connected back to the medical network

752
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:28,260
and you know went back to doing your

753
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:30,240
stuff no no she would not she was

754
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,590
walking there she was oh yeah I hope

755
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,589
patients don't have that access to the

756
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:40,589
MRI machine

757
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:42,150
so so anyway three weeks later so

758
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:44,578
everything is okay right I mean it's

759
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,430
stupid but it's okay because it's back

760
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:49,619
on the medical network always good sweet

761
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,049
mix later there was an outage in the

762
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,089
medical network elect two seconds so

763
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:56,400
nobody really paid attention to it okay

764
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:58,489
it shouldn't happen but okay did a few

765
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,660
seconds or was back on all is good

766
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:03,900
except that the MRI machine switch to

767
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:07,440
the Starbucks Network so now you have

768
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:14,700
MRI tests being sent out on on the

769
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:17,819
Starbucks Network public network Smart

770
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,578
TVs so we talked about projectors let's

771
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,410
talk about TVs every boardroom has small

772
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,480
TVs heavy board rules where not every

773
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,430
most board rooms have really top-secret

774
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,410
personal information things that we

775
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:34,230
don't want to get anywhere right this is

776
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,098
another true story Smart TV was

777
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,430
compromised

778
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,019
and with a malware that malware instead

779
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:44,489
of trying to spread in the network

780
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:46,859
started spreading using Wi-Fi smart TVs

781
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:49,049
are they don't have chromecast nowadays

782
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:52,410
or other casts for that matter the

783
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:54,029
broadcasting an SSID right they're

784
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,529
actually doing the same for broadcasting

785
00:37:54,029 --> 00:37:58,410
for bluetooth so you can connect through

786
00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:01,710
that you so they just started

787
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:05,368
broadcasting that whatever was open just

788
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:07,910
cut it and got the malware by that so

789
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,079
you're asking you might be asking okay

790
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,379
what did armies do about it right

791
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,059
because you know and again and I'll get

792
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,299
at the end like in the next five minutes

793
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,309
about what we're doing about that but

794
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:22,890
it's not in the network and I started

795
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:26,670
with saying protecting the network so

796
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,960
how did we found out that so people

797
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,779
don't know about people don't know that

798
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,989
but I was like oh okay the access point

799
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:35,249
I don't see which whose access point

800
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,720
that is but yeah it's right there I

801
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:39,328
don't see who's the manufacturer but

802
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:44,160
anyway most likely its Cisco aruba

803
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,390
because we're in the u.s. so people

804
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,250
don't know that those access points

805
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:51,779
actually have a model

806
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:56,400
that scans all the Wi-Fi in the area on

807
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:58,140
2.4 and five niggers that means that if

808
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,150
I am using this computer right here I'm

809
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,580
not in I'm not in the guest network here

810
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:08,070
I'm not on any network if I'm connecting

811
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:10,380
it to my phone's hotspot it will know if

812
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm connecting it over Bluetooth because

813
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,930
I have a I know FM keyboard that I

814
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,279
connect to the computer it will know

815
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,200
nothing is connected to this access

816
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,410
point but it will still know about this

817
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,660
axis same for ZigBee same for any type

818
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:28,290
of information of traffic that's two

819
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:30,450
point four or five gigahertz that's how

820
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:32,759
we know about it we come to these places

821
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:35,848
we look at that information we say hey

822
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:41,670
did you know that x y&z connected to

823
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:44,160
your Smart TV usually answer is what my

824
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:49,050
favorite boardroom story is actually

825
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,210
about it's one of our first clients we

826
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:54,000
came into an office environment

827
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:57,839
nothing special not medical not ot not

828
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,510
nothing and we did a nice POC we

829
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,520
connected ourselves we got spam traffic

830
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,170
right copied the traffic of the network

831
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,109
listening to that Network

832
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:09,150
and and then we came back after a week

833
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:11,009
we kind of give results and we show the

834
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,050
dashboard that we went through alerts

835
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,940
and we say you have to have death and

836
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,670
this is what you do and what's very

837
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,730
interesting and then the last one was in

838
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,430
by the way did that tablet that you have

839
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,430
in your boardroom this is and then they

840
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:28,549
stopped us which tablet that work you

841
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,109
have a tablet in the boardroom that's

842
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:34,050
sending traffic every night at 2:00 a.m.

843
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,520
to somewhere and that somewhere is

844
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:41,070
outside of your network I don't know

845
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,480
where it's in a cloud and they and they

846
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,890
say well what happened we don't have

847
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,510
that we don't have it habit

848
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,980
there's no tablet in that bottom so

849
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,390
everything I don't know I know there

850
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,330
isn't have that I know it's connected to

851
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,348
the access point called the boardroom so

852
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,180
either you have another access point

853
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,599
called the wardroom which I hope you

854
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,700
don't or you have a tablet connected to

855
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,730
your boardroom so they literally we were

856
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,580
sitting at that boardroom

857
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,080
he stood up went look at all the there

858
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,740
was some deaths around there's some

859
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,259
closets and found the tablet tablet was

860
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,970
there like forever and was sending that

861
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,790
in for me it was recording whatever was

862
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:22,750
in the office and send it up to wherever

863
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:30,460
it was yeah so this is why yeah so this

864
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:31,120
is this is the help let me jump yeah

865
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,550
okay

866
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:39,400
last example and then and then we'll go

867
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:43,240
to the last slide actually no I'll stay

868
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,430
with the TV's last the story this is one

869
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,640
of my favorites it's not type of

870
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:54,520
security though it's a bit more funny

871
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,520
than that so Friday 7:00 p.m. I'm in the

872
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,950
middle of a a POC with the most

873
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:05,080
important client in the world must-win

874
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:07,180
project everything has to work ok again

875
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,799
Friday 7:00 p.m. right and I get the

876
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,290
phone call and said well there is this

877
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,510
lady in this I don't know why again it

878
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:16,450
was the lady I later I later I later met

879
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,730
her instead there is this lady on the

880
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:23,020
fourth floor of this building in

881
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:25,240
California in which were installed and

882
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:28,570
she says that Internet is really

883
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,629
sluggish and there are issues in the

884
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,400
network and I really wanted the same way

885
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,640
she might want to go home and it's

886
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:41,590
Friday 7 p.m. 4 p.m. California fine but

887
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,080
ok let's call it a day a week and I

888
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:50,560
couldn't do that so we opened the Consul

889
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:53,710
together and we saw a few alerts so the

890
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:58,440
first alert that we saw was abnormal

891
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:01,210
behavior for a device of type Smart TV

892
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,430
so a few things there first of all a

893
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,140
Smart TV should do very specific things

894
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:07,149
right I mean it should

895
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,190
well show something right it should

896
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,500
download traffic because if you are

897
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,490
using onion on Netflix or whatnot it

898
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:19,600
should download that it should download

899
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:22,709
some updates right software updates for

900
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:27,460
the TV hopefully not much more than that

901
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:30,970
so this mart TV was uploading 100 gigs a

902
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:43,960
day and there were 4 of those in the

903
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:46,629
building uploading uploading so so that

904
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:50,110
was one alert second alert was a policy

905
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,930
violation so they basically according to

906
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,820
their regulation that company small tvs

907
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:58,000
should not be connected to the network

908
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:00,130
at all that's whatever that's what they

909
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,230
sent some companies do it this way some

910
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:05,500
other way but they had the strict

911
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:09,930
regulations regulation no TV should be

912
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:12,220
connected to the network and yet it was

913
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:15,540
so that's what the alert that's the

914
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,830
second order that came third alert was

915
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,990
abnormal behavior for the network

916
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,180
nothing should upload 100 gigs a day

917
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,250
right so one alert was a small TV

918
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,770
shouldn't behave that way neither alert

919
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,440
was a nothing should behave that way ok

920
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,820
just take a look at that

921
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,440
anyway what happened was and that's why

922
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,360
I'm saying it's it's so funny because

923
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,500
it's not it was not an attack I'll get

924
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,990
to the end of it it's kind of like the

925
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,370
fish that we didn't burn so it's kind of

926
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,680
the same thing it was not an attack that

927
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:44,589
the Russians were not you know attacking

928
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,430
that office in California or nobody else

929
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,630
attacked it what happened was that

930
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,160
somebody connected that TV to the

931
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,320
network again he shouldn't have right I

932
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,640
said it's against the law against their

933
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:00,760
regulation and yet he did that if we try

934
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,480
to get an update as it should it was

935
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,670
blocked by their neck so now the TV

936
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,130
tried because it was not connected to

937
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,450
the network it didn't have a certificate

938
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:13,120
so then the TV tried to get a

939
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,939
certificate and failed because TVs are

940
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,009
not receiving certificates so then we

941
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,070
try to update to up to update the

942
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:23,070
software and fail and then try to get a

943
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:25,410
certificate and failed

944
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,570
and it did it quite faster than you know

945
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:31,950
my withum of speaking and got to a

946
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:34,380
hundred gigs a day this is a really big

947
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,930
client so they're not just a big client

948
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,960
of ours they're also big client of

949
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:42,540
Samsung okay it was the Samsung TV so

950
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,570
they reached out to Samsung and said hmm

951
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:48,360
like what are you doing and told them

952
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,490
the story and Samsung said no way that's

953
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,080
not happening so they came back to us

954
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,180
and said hey well first of all you saw

955
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,040
your network so something did happen and

956
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,779
B here are the logs of everything

957
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,630
because I see everything I listen to all

958
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,080
the traffic I show everything here are

959
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,390
my logs

960
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,810
so they went back to Samsung Samsung

961
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:09,420
came back and said well we're gonna do

962
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:12,029
it there's nothing wrong with the TV X

963
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:19,350
exactly it should be here's a patch by

964
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:22,380
the way ok so not to spend all the

965
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:26,009
weekend I'm going to jump over all of

966
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:30,810
that and get to the last point in two

967
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:32,580
minutes to nothing I hope so why am i

968
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,340
speaking about all of that except that

969
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:38,220
IOT so fun what are we doing so we are

970
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,650
armas and we are basically coming to big

971
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,890
corporates and we are when we are giving

972
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:46,980
three things discover analyze and

973
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,150
protect full discovery of all the

974
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,570
devices in your network

975
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:54,870
everything computer servers BYOD device

976
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:57,780
IOT device ot devices medical banking

977
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,720
whatever it is if it has a pulse now if

978
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,060
it has a MAC address or an IP we see

979
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,490
that right that's why I started with

980
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,480
asking who has a same DB who thinks

981
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,120
Aseem DB is good

982
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,490
nobody this is the only source of truth

983
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,730
because it listens to the traffic nobody

984
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:17,790
can hide second thing is understanding

985
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:20,640
what is this device doing so okay gets I

986
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:23,430
discovered the device and I see it has

987
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,830
traffic great I am able to compare that

988
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,629
to my knowledge base and I'm able to

989
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,540
show what type of device it is this is

990
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:33,260
the camera this is a dishwasher this is

991
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,599
a projector they say whatever it is and

992
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,880
I can show how it should behave like

993
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,949
so going back to the TV I know that it

994
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,169
shouldn't behave that way going back to

995
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:44,669
a camera that has bought net I know it

996
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:46,739
shouldn't behave that way going back to

997
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,609
the MRI machine I know that it shouldn't

998
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,079
behave that way

999
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:51,869
that's the strength of what we're

1000
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,479
showing completely passive no agents no

1001
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:56,400
installing anything not doing anything

1002
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:58,379
listening to the traffic knowing what

1003
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,799
the device is what it should behave like

1004
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,789
in saying hey that's not good that's

1005
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:05,249
abnormal

1006
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:08,099
that's malicious that's a breach of

1007
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:09,808
policy and the last part is protecting

1008
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:12,150
and saying okay you got the malicious

1009
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:15,539
device let's take it out of your network

1010
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:26,189
okay I'm still within my two minutes so

1011
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:29,759
questions okay yes so I'm getting two

1012
00:48:26,189 --> 00:48:31,769
sources of traffic one is the two

1013
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:34,229
sources of traffic one is my wirelessly

1014
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:37,229
your wireless LAN controller just read

1015
00:48:34,229 --> 00:48:39,718
only show commands and the second and

1016
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:41,640
most important is a spent port or tab if

1017
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,789
you have it but basically spend port

1018
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,499
copying or receiving a copy of your

1019
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:48,659
traffic that's why I call it listen

1020
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:50,939
because we just get we're not in the

1021
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:52,709
middle and not poking the devices we're

1022
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:56,219
not trying to reach out to the device in

1023
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:58,678
any way we just receive that traffic

1024
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:08,429
from your span listen to it and do

1025
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:10,799
everything yeah so first of all we are

1026
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:13,859
in the cloud so there's a nice cloud

1027
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:16,739
picture there we put something on site

1028
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:18,779
we get that traffic we parse it we

1029
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:20,819
reduce it get only the metadata and send

1030
00:49:18,779 --> 00:49:24,179
it up to our cloud so that that's one

1031
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:26,489
thing second thing nothing stays only in

1032
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:28,709
the cloud so it's good enough that let's

1033
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:30,269
say that you have a million servers in

1034
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:32,129
the cloud and they are connecting to

1035
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:34,348
your actual network because you need to

1036
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:36,059
get out of the cloud one day connect to

1037
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:37,559
your actual network that's how we'll get

1038
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:40,019
all the traffic coming from the cloud

1039
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,779
by the way you know roadmap pretty soon

1040
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:44,609
we're going to just duplicate everything

1041
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:47,609
to the cloud itself and kind of put

1042
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:49,529
instead of a appliance and like a

1043
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,980
physical thing we'll duplicate that into

1044
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:59,100
the cloud

1045
00:49:49,980 --> 00:50:01,740
you okay yes I it's nothing so we're

1046
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,660
usually doing its either virtual machine

1047
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:07,080
just four cores something really small

1048
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,319
or we're using a one you have deep tiny

1049
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,840
server so it's really simple and the

1050
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,970
reason it's so small is that it doesn't

1051
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,070
do anything it just takes the traffic

1052
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,080
which uses it and send it up to the

1053
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:20,760
cloud so I can throw that the cloud

1054
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:25,830
environment is a monster one but you

1055
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:28,340
don't care about that okay thank you so

1056
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,340
much and
