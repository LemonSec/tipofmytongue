on time and stay on track track 1 so

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,619
first of all let me make a few

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,840
announcements of where everything is we

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,580
have obviously you're in track 1 the CTF

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,230
is right next door the mental health

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,170
hackers is right down the hall

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,230
track 2 is going to be right above us on

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,250
up by all the sponsors and registration

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
everyone should have a badge so you

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,869

say thank you so much to all of our all

13
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,610
of our sponsors we obviously could not

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,760
do this without all of them so

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,370
definitely visit their booths and give

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,260
them give them your attention because

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,849
you might not need their products today

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,329
but it's all about establishing

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,329
relationships and and you might need

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,000

receive beautiful electronic badges from

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,770
China unfortunately things fail things

36
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,320

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,020
based on offense hacking and reversing

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,600
well track two is going to be focusing

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,439
on defense cloud and DevOps so can I get

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,509
a show of hands for for interest for

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,000
track one

47
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,510
and show of hands for interest for track

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,250
2 awesome so it's just about even so we

49
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,260
should we should be able to accommodate

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,650
both both sides

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,840
[Music]

52
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,060
another thing the CTF if you guys have

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
not do not know what a CTF is it's

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,380
basically a capture the flag where you

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,420
solve technical challenges so if you

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,040
want to learn something new and I always

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,869
learn something new

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,380
definitely visit the CTF right next door

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,390

pleased to have you have you here CCSU

96
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,269
has a long history in this state it's

97
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,280
the oldest publicly supported University

98
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,960
in the state of Connecticut and so we're

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,030
really proud of that fact we serve

100
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,460
eleven thousand one hundred and fifty

101
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,780
four students this fall about eighty one

102
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,900
percent of our students at an

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,000
undergraduate level about 19 percent at

104
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,400
the graduate level so we do offer a full

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,520
array of graduate and undergraduate

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,250
programs a few years ago the university

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,289
decided to join several of our academic

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,380
departments into a school of engineering

109
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,920
science and technology as a move really

110
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,409
to focus on on STEM disciplines as a

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,650
move in order to to try to encourage

112
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,880
introduced disciplinary activity and we

113
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,250
have a couple of our academic

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,290
departments that are very closely tied

115
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,450
to the work your work you're looking at

116
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,070
today to the cybersecurity issue our

117
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,960
computer science department and our

118
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,140
computer electronics and graphics

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,299
technology department and I am so

120
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,110
pleased to see how those two units have

121
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,910
collaborated in developing a couple of

122
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,590
academic programs a new Bachelor of

123
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,110
Science and cybersecurity that we're

124
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,909
offering at CCSU and also they

125
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,580
collaborate in a computer engineering

126
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,080
technology bachelor's degree as well in

127
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,510
addition to that we have computer

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,580
science degrees at the bachelors level

129
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,469
electronics technology networking

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,750
information technology and at the

131
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,940
graduate level software engineering and

132
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,610
MS and software engineering and an MS

133
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,210
and computer information technology so

134
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:36,390
those are all just brash announcements

135
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,799
and and so on of potential programs out

136
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,419
there that some of you may be interested

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,630
in pursuing so I'd encourage you to look

138
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,479
into those if you're interested we also

139
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,990
maintain within our degree program a

140
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,990
software engineering studio which allows

141
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,350
our students to connect with industry to

142
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,360
solve industry based problems and that I

143
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,520
think is a great opportunity for

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,580
our students - to see real-world

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,609
problems and try to get them resolved so

146
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,340
I guess enough about CCSU today we're

147
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,469
very pleased to have you here in Willard

148
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,128
D Loretto Hall which is just opened

149
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,560
about a year year and a half ago and it

150
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:18,569
is a beautiful facility as you can see

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,400
we hope it'll serve you well for your

152
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,129
conference today we're so pleased to

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,229
have you with us today and let's move on

154
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,280

and I also forgot to introduce myself I

157
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,400
am Roman and obviously this besides is a

158
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,159
volunteer-driven organization there's

159
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,620
about 25 or so volunteers that helped to

160
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:47,039
put this on it we don't get no personal

161
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,020
benefit out of it so they make sure to

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,139
you know if you see a volunteer say

163
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:57,870
thank you and and just the in general

164
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:59,789
alright and another thing actually I

165
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,889
