Adrienne's asked me not to wander around

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,539
a little bit because I tend to do that

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,560
so I'm gonna try to stay on camera so

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,080

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,419
Keynote this they said fifty

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,189
seventy-five on average that's what we

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,560

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,040
origin story but what we're going to

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,590
talk about today is really a community

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,880
story and how 'besides plays into our

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,090
community so I'll talk a little bit

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,100
about b-sides as a community I'll talk a

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,280
little bit about why I'm here right part

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,509
of that community why you're here right

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,979
joining in participating in a community

36
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:33,420
and then we'll also talk about who else

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,329
is here right so as you look around this

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,530
room it's Roman was speaking you see

39
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,419
some of the folks sitting next to you

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,820
we'll talk about who else is here who's

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,380
in our community and then lastly we'll

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,839
sort of close with we're not alone and

43
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,380
it's not an alien reference it's a we

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,549
need to do this as a community and I

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,759
don't have a clicker so I'm going to go

46
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,500
through this the old way so blackhat so

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,570
Romans wearing a hat right so that's how

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,729
we find Roman today Romans got the black

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,258
hat hat on right so black hat I was

50
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,570
gonna say is it the top hat that Jack

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,340
Daniels is wearing but it's it's not

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,798
just a hat right it's a conference and

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,110
black hat was founded way back in 1997

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,790
so I was afraid at Central I was gonna

55
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,860
have an audience that wasn't born in

56
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,190
1997 but it looks like it's

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,650
it's fairly well mixed this morning so

58
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:23,010
1997 so that's a little bit of time ago

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,370
and it really by 2009 black hat had

60
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,929
become this really big head right it was

61
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,550
it was the thing that started all those

62
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,590
awkward conversations that we had with

63
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,820
our bosses and our spouses when we said

64
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,830
we had to go to Vegas for work right no

65
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,019
no really it's work but what happened by

66
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,650
2009 was black out with such a big head

67
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,200
it was such a the go to conference that

68
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,700
there was speakers and talks that were

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,649
getting rejected that weren't finding

70
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,049
their way into that week-long conference

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,610
right so it had grown beyond just sort

72
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,410
of this national now it's an

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,020
international brand they've got logo

74
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,060
where they do training it's it's quite

75
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,840
an incredible organization and out of

76
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,150
that came folks like Mike Murray and

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,890
Mike Don and Jennifer legio and Jack

78
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,200
Daniel who started to think about what

79
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,839
can we do with all of this sort of

80
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,000
content that isn't making the cut for

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,970
blackhat and out of that grew this

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,360
concept of b-sides right the B side the

83
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,900
B side is sort of an homage back to an A

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,370
and a B side of a seventy five a seventy

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,910
eight forty five or thirty three and a

86
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,140
half our p.m. photographic record it's

87
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,690
this where I lose the crowd right

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,040
because well vinyls coming back but for

89
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,230
those of you that were raised in the 80s

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,510
a cassette had an A and a B side right

91
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,399
and typically the a side was what the

92
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,048
artist wanted you to buy that's what you

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,489
were paying for and the B side was

94
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,650
either extra music or garbage music or a

95
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,810
bonus right bonus music it was free

96
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,980
music so before there was Napster and

97
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,450
streaming and all these things there's

98
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,790
the free music was you bought the a side

99
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,730
you got the B side and I think bonus for

100
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,429
me is really indicative of what B sides

101
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,660
is as a community right it's its bonus

102
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,700
right the content that you guys are

103
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,769
going to experience today will show a

104
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,149
hands for track one or track two I think

105
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,010
most of us would like to be in bolt

106
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,320
right how do we how do we do both tracks

107
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,390
simultaneously and thankfully it's being

108
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,469
recorded so we can go and maybe be in

109
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,890
both places at the same time later on so

110
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:25,020
you know talk about getting old right so

111
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:27,630
2009 was ten years ago so the first

112
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,490
b-sides was in July of

113
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,840
Denine so this past July was the tenth

114
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,760
birthday or the tenth anniversary of

115
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,830
b-sides and when we talk about these

116
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,870
these founders these folks that's their

117
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,789
names on a plaque names I mentioned like

118
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,500
Jack Daniel and Mike Murray and jennifer

119
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,720
twomey they're not just names on a

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,940
plaque or names on the b-sides history

121
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,470
site website these are people sitting

122
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,690
next to you these are like both rock

123
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,490
stars in our community and people that

124
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,500
we can just talk to you or tweet to or

125
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,960
interact with so that's I mean for us

126
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,530
that is such an important part of the

127
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,270
community and then what I hope these

128
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,919
sides will mean to you is that it will

129
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,270
become part of your origin story so for

130
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,220
those of you that raised your hand said

131
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,390
hey this is my first time you're gonna

132
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,100
meet people today you're gonna make

133
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,719
friends even with the vendors you're

134
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,520
gonna make friends and these are gonna

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,330
be relationships that you'll have for a

136
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,060
lifetime so talk a little bit about my

137
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,880
origin story and I went ahead on that or

138
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,010
the two automations did come in right so

139
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,900
my origin story is I wanted to be a cop

140
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,820
my father was a cop my grandfather was a

141
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,460
cop I had lots of uncles they were war

142
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,990
cops and you know even though that was

143
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,909
sort of my path growing up I wasn't

144
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,800
really sure what I wanted to be when I

145
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,180
grew up and there's some days where I'm

146
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,060
still not really sure what I want to be

147
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,340
when I grow up so after high school I

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,500
worked for Amtrak for about a year

149
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,330
that's a story for another talk if

150
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,130
you've ever traveled or used Amtrak you

151
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,740
you know that's just too long of a talk

152
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,260
for this morning so after high school I

153
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,640
went and I do I enrolled at Naugatuck

154
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,219

155
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,050
associate's degree program in 1989

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,120

I know it's early on Saturday morning it

161
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,060
took me three years to complete a

162
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,110
two-year associate's degree that happens

163
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,670
for a lot of us once I got done I joined

164
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,960
the Air Force which is a which we'll

165
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,670
talk about in a little bit but in

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,430
reality I've been at Naugatuck Valley

167
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,470
for what feels like 30 years so 89 and

168
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,000
92 I was a student I left for a little

169
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,340
bit was in the Air Force I came back to

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,080
NACA tech Valley in 1999 as an adjunct

171
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,630
instructor teaching networking and

172
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,830
computer courses and really if never I

173
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,680
feel like I've never left I feel like

174
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,229
I've been part of that community for you

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,900
know 30 30 years now so

176
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,330
show of hands veterans folks that have

177
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,498
served our serving thank you so much for

178
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:55,180
your service we're two days away from

179
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:56,830
veterans today so now I ask that you

180
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,020
don't answer this question so after I

181
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,560
graduated with my associates degree I

182
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,060
figured out I was trying to think about

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,979
how I could differentiate myself how I

184
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,569
could you know I wanted to be a police

185
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:09,430
officer I was applying at every town

186
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:11,439
know I could talk New Britain State

187
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,300
Police Waterbury and ice trying to

188
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,550
differentiate myself in my professional

189
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,249
resume not like blue hair or tattoos but

190
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,599
how do I build my professional resume so

191
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,639
I decided to talk to an Air Force

192
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,930
recruiter and in the joke for those of

193
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,159
you that know the answer to this is how

194
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,729
do you know when your recruiter is lying

195
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,379
to you when their lips are moving right

196
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:30,849
so I went and I talked to an Air Force

197
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,039
recruiter about a law enforcement or

198
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,509
security forces position because that's

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,060
what I you know that's what I wanted to

200
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:40,389
do and I thought that would best help my

201
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,740
resume my professional resume what

202
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:42,789
happened was this recruiter said I don't

203
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,680
have a law enforcement or security

204
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,199
forces I have this thing called a

205
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,479
computer systems operator and I went to

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,129
what and he said no no this is you'll

207
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,719
have a top-secret clearance so the

208
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:55,389
government will trust you and so will

209
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,039
every municipality in the United States

210
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,930
so you know when you're ready to go back

211
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,330
to law enforcement this this will help

212
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,789
you immensely your ASVAB scores were

213
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,758
phenomenal you'll do you'll do great and

214
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,169
I was sold like I believed him

215
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,999
so I took it right and you know what it

216
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,979
turned out that recruiter was was right

217
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,629
right he was on to something I ended up

218
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,878
really liking that computer stuff so I

219
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,919
sort of dug in and I learned as much as

220
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,199
I could now again sort of dating myself

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,969
it's the mid-90s there was this really

222
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,089
new cool operating system coming out

223
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:28,240
called Windows 95 yeah so I was working

224
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,069
on that and so my Air Force career ended

225
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,469
in 2013 are retired from the Air

226
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,479
National Guard that was a huge part of

227
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,729
community for me I miss it every day

228
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,539
don't don't tell my wife she'll she'll

229
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,370
be mad that's being recorded I'm screwed

230
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:47,470
can we can we fix that and post-op post

231
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:49,899
edit just take that out anyway so again

232
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,069
it's the late 90s it's the early 2000s

233
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,410
and I'm working for the Air Force

234
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:54,610
full-time and a friend a mentor or

235
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,560
colleague a gentleman but

236
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,610
name of Brian Sheehan he says you know

237
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,349
you got to go out and you got to talk to

238
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,540
people and you got to get involved with

239
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,010
groups and you got a few stuff and in

240
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,189
real life right because there is no

241
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,959
LinkedIn in 2000 so he introduces me to

242
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,690
the information system security

243
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,719
association or Issa they had meetings in

244
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,700
Harford that were monthly and what an

245
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,529
opportunity to go there much like today

246
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,300
but on a smaller scale right the

247
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,970
meetings were designed for gathering

248
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,339
people together for networking and for

249
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,019
learning but you know for me what what

250
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,329
really helped me out I think for many of

251
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,610
us in our sort of our origin story in

252
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:32,829
our community is was learning how to

253
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,870
sort of interact with people when so

254
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,250
today when folks company to say tell me

255
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,829
what you're doing or what you're working

256
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,750
on we tend to say what we're doing or

257
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:43,029
what we're working on and those early

258
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,950
Issa meetings sort of helped me learn to

259
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,140
say things like what I'm currently doing

260
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,120
is I'm configuring firewalls for the Air

261
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,170
Force well what's interesting is I think

262
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,930
there's going to be an opportunity for

263
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,640
Sigma or Aetna to do some of the things

264
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,140
that I'm learning in what I'm doing for

265
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,600
the Air Force so it helped me sort of

266
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,430
mature the story of my origin and move

267
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,870
me from one career to the next thing so

268
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,540
I think as you have those conversations

269
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,860
today think about not only what you're

270
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,719
doing but where you want to go and

271
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:13,420
especially for those little those of us

272
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,980
that are students from is to say I was

273
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,680
introduced to this group called the

274
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,750
InfraGard which is a public-private

275
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
partnership folks familiar with

276
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,279
InfraGard probably some of it between

277
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,500
the FBI and in public and private

278
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,329
industry and what that did for me was

279
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,890
really it sort of appealed to my law

280
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,140
enforcement background your interests

281
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,380
and it appealed to sort of my military

282
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,880
background and what a great group I was

283
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,680
part of the founding group here in

284
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,660
Connecticut were I think in the 20th

285
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,670
year now of that organization there's

286
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,719
probably 900 members in the state of

287
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,060
Connecticut it's a national organization

288
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,190
but there is Connecticut chapters not

289
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,170
every meeting is cyber related sometimes

290
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,449
they talk about shipping and you know

291
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,979
electrical and power and water but it's

292
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:59,769
a great group to be involved with and

293
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,529
then lastly before I left at in the back

294
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:05,529
in 2006 was as I was building this feels

295
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,819
like a really really long time ago I get

296
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,320
introduced this organization called a

297
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:11,860
high technology crime

298
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,830
investigation Association HT CIA in what

299
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,920
that was was as time there wasn't a lot

300
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,780
of private forensics going on it was all

301
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,120
law enforcement so again really sort of

302
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,959
appealed the interest to my my law

303
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,850
enforcement sorry if we could on the CTF

304
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,650
hack this thermostat as like the first

305
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,310
goal that would be really great really

306
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,770
warm in here so HTC ia at the time was

307
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,750
this group of largely law enforcement

308
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,370
the state of Connecticut but helps me

309
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,740
sort of understand how to build out this

310
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,900
forensics lab at at none before I left

311
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,450
and I was so engaged and so involved

312
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,860
with HTC a that they sort of elected me

313
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,230
president and I was president of that

314
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,970
organization for a very long time and if

315
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,580
you're into forensics computer forensics

316
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,590
if you've not found that community here

317
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:02,230
HCC ia I highly recommend that you take

318
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:05,800
a look at it and enjoy and that was my

319
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,620
last slide there so I'm gonna be 49 and

320
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,020
11 day I feel really really old wait

321
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,520
this slide this slides not about me it's

322
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,470
about you so what I meant to say is that

323
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm not as young as I think I am or is

324
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,210
not as young as I used to be and what's

325
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,069
important for this right this is a very

326
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,810
you know quick keynote to start the day

327
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,670
but as you think about today as you're

328
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,050
sitting here just think about we all

329
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,339
started somewhere so a number of you

330
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,069
raised your hand and said this is your

331
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,900
first time right everyone in this room

332
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,090
whether it today is your first time or

333
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,380
today is your sixth time we all started

334
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,500
somewhere right we all started this

335
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,380
journey together starting from nothing

336
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,390
right so I want you to keep in mind that

337
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,820
the smartest the coolest the best hacker

338
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,010
that you'll meet today or that you'll

339
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,930
see speak today was just once like you

340
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,180
they were sitting here for the first

341
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,819
time so keep in mind that we're all sort

342
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,530
of be it started at the same beginning

343
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,450
and for those of you that are the cool

344
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,939
kids like like Ryan that are really that

345
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,350
you know the smart hackers and the folks

346
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,960
that we come to see you know in the

347
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,340
other tracks just remember how important

348
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,930
it was when you were starting out when

349
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,880
someone came up and talked to you right

350
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,650
engaged with you how impactful that was

351
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,900
for you both personally and

352
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,699
professionally and I I just strongly

353
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,410
encouraged the dialogue I saw some great

354
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,020
conversations going on even before this

355
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,089
started so me you know make sure you're

356
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,480
engaging with one another and then I

357
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,190
have

358
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,170
curiosity right so will your story your

359
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,100
origin story be one of curiosity right

360
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,750
so curiosity

361
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,690
might have brought you here today it

362
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,430
might have brought you into the this the

363
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,199
course of study here it's essentially

364
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,000
you're in you know we like as

365
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,649
professionals we like to think about how

366
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,899
things break rights many of us might

367
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,940
have grown up taking things apart and

368
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:46,750
some of us were better putting them back

369
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,510
together than others sometimes we like

370
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,820
to see how things our systems fail right

371
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,949
how we can take something and make it do

372
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,570
something to creator never intended to

373
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,430
do right so that's part of curiosity I

374
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,860
think that binds us brings us together

375
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,329
and that's important for us to remember

376
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,519
and I think there's a way to think about

377
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:05,979
that and from a critical thinking or

378
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,870
sort of question everything perspective

379
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,029
and I have paranoia up there right so

380
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,730
security folks in general can be accused

381
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,639
of being paranoid ryan's laughing at me

382
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,070
is that an understatement right a

383
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,750
paranoid should be right so in that in

384
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,570
that vein we often see how things fail

385
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,100
right we tend to see where there's

386
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,949
there's gaps and that's what we're

387
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,839
trained to look at right and that can be

388
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:30,160
perceived as paranoia try to be sort of

389
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,060
a healthy paranoia if that's possible

390
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,269
and try to be not always sort of you

391
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,888
know the the debbie downer I guess is

392
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,199
the right rants and then also be

393
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,670
optimistic right how many security folks

394
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,529
do you know that are optimistic it's not

395
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:49,060
it's things that one there thank you

396
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:50,709
yeah it's always one but typically we

397
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,268
were not optimistic we're always sort of

398
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:53,529
chasing perfection right we've got to be

399
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,120
right a hundred percent of the time the

400
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,279
bad guys have a series only got to be

401
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,610
right once so you know try to be

402
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,769
optimistic don't chase perfection focus

403
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,850
on your successes I used to tell Alex a

404
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,319
lot like there was so much that we

405
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,060
weren't accomplishing but there was so

406
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:09,069
much that we were doing and we always

407
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,719
used to focus on what we didn't get done

408
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:12,219
or we didn't finish so try to be

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,889
optimistic I know it's really really

410
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,370
hard we're in an academic setting my new

411
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:20,639
role at EDUCAUSE is providing cyber

412
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,319
security consultation and advice to

413
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,029
higher ed throughout the the country and

414
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,529
back in the fall there was two

415
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,529
universities that were impacted by

416
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:31,660
ransomware Regis University near Denver

417
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,819
and Stevens Institute of Technology in

418
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,649
New Jersey and everybody in higher ed is

419
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:37,360
freaking out about what

420
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,279
happened how they how they were

421
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,649
vulnerable you know how the threat

422
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,279
propagated what happened and but

423
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:47,170
educause serves over 4,000 colleges and

424
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,939
universities so we're really concerned

425
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,339
about two that got burned with

426
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,569
ransomware but there's four thousand

427
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,980
that are doing something right and I

428
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,079
don't think they're just being lucky I

429
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,579
think there's a good story to tell there

430
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,368
so I try to think about how we can be

431
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:02,170
optimistic and focus on where we're

432
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:05,079
winning not only being in the news where

433
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:08,469
there's breeches and then sort of lastly

434
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,569
I know if this is going to work anybody

435
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,189
remove remember the movie The Sixth

436
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,569
Sense

437
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:16,179
all right so most of you that's good I

438
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:18,910
was worried so in the movie that the kid

439
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:20,949
Halle dill Joel Osment all he saw was

440
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,589
dead people right so I've been accused

441
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:24,459
of being like that kid except I don't

442
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,980
see dead people

443
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:29,050
all I see is problems right well you see

444
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,629
his problems right so don't don't end up

445
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,729
being an old curmudgeon don't don't just

446
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,829
see problems see solutions and sort of

447
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,449
that's where this community is so

448
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,949
helpful because the conversations that

449
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,240
you have around things that you see as

450
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,699
problems or things you're struggling

451
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,019
with in your own environment somebody if

452
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:45,399
somebody sitting next to you may have

453
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:47,860
that answer and may be able to help you

454
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,420
with that so as you look around the room

455
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,100
right you know who's sitting next to you

456
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,529
you know who's in front of you you know

457
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,209
who's behind you some of you may be so

458
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,350
I'm not gonna ask you to get up and

459
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,939
introduce yourself it's way too early

460
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,800
for that I know it's a Saturday morning

461
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,509
so don't and I literally I have like two

462
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,519
more slides so you can introduce

463
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,380
yourself to each other on the way out as

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,349
you talk about what a great keynote this

465
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,299
was and you're so glad you came so you

466
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,158
know look around some of these speakers

467
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,720
that are here yeah I look at the agenda

468
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:15,669
and I look at who I want to go and see

469
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,319
and generally and thankfully not this

470
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,480
morning there's generally somebody on

471
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,789
the agenda the same time I'm talking

472
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,970
that I would rather go see than myself

473
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,709
so think about who you came to see

474
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,419
besides me of course who you want to

475
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,360
meet how you want to interact with those

476
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,890
those folks today I know many of us are

477
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,199
introverts you know I don't want to

478
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,590
stereotype the the geek and the security

479
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,539
nerds and in the space but it happens

480
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,639
and it's hard it's hard for us to as

481
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,110
introverts interact with people go up

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,909
and have a conversation try to be

483
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,039
purposeful about that today try to

484
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,560
engage with folks if you see someone you

485
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,240
know ask

486
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,250
they're doing you asking what they're

487
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,570
working on what they're interested in if

488
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,920
you're not ready for that today you

489
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,990
don't want to you know have social

490
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,090
interaction today but later on you want

491
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,190
to connect with me on LinkedIn and tell

492
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,889
me what a great talk this was or it

493
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,000
wasn't just say that you know when you

494
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,830
reach out to somebody on LinkedIn

495
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,250
whether it's me or if you're you know

496
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,050
studying AI at Central and you find

497
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,550
somebody on LinkedIn that's really a

498
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,510
leader in that space reach out to them

499
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,550
and say hey I'm in a cybersecurity

500
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,350
program at Central I see that you're a

501
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,639
leader in this space I'd love to connect

502
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,530
with you and learn from you I think

503
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,190
those connections those communities are

504
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,660
hugely important for all of us I was

505
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,540
going to say you know if you're not on

506
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,220
Twitter already you know the InfoSec

507
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,050
cyber security hacker community on

508
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,250
Twitter is phenomenal there's some

509
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,330
really great you know I talked about

510
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,120
Twitter and I worry it's gonna turn into

511
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,520
a political conversation but specific to

512
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,949
cybersecurity there's a great dialogue

513
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,480
going on out there and then we are in an

514
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,390
academic setting so I have to talk about

515
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,010
reading right so I'm a geek and I like

516
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,070
to read and I like history so I don't

517
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:55,550
fit me a they're nerdy geek or a geeky

518
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,110
nerd tribe of hackers folk some of you

519
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,870
might have read that already a great

520
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,790
book it's got 70 profiles in it of folks

521
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,010
in our community it sort of reads like a

522
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,899
QA about how they got started what they

523
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,150
think the future of cybersecurity is

524
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,010
it's a great read I was also fortunate

525
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,500
to be involved with the cybersecurity

526
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,330
cannon project so hopefully you've heard

527
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,360
of it if you haven't go ahead and google

528
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,580
it Palo Alto sponsors it but it's really

529
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,229
an independent sort of body of knowledge

530
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,850
of books that we should all be reading

531
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,310
while it was part of it I got to meet

532
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:28,969
Kevin Paulson from Wired magazine and he

533
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:31,070
wrote kingpin so really I encourage you

534
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,310
to read whether that's audiobooks or

535
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,520
however you consume just go out and read

536
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,379
as much as you can and this is my last

537
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,629
slide so my professional commute my

538
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,790
professional community began at Issa

539
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,250
meeting and it really expanded through

540
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,750
so many different organizations many of

541
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,940
them are listed here right so I think

542
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,890
for you just make sure that you're

543
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,030
including as many of these organizations

544
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,760
and there might be others that I'm

545
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,230
missing because I'm an old guy so if

546
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,640
there's things that you know about come

547
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,810
up and talk to me and say hey Brian we

548
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,610
should you should be talking about these

549
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,720
organizations because that's what's

550
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,279
coming

551
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,409
I think you know way to talked about

552
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,289
we're not alone you can't learn alone we

553
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:11,210
can't learn alone we can't succeed alone

554
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,700
it's so important for us to be part of

555
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,320
the community Connecticut is a really

556
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,940
small state but there's so many vibrant

557
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,950
communities I have some of them listed

558
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,890
there and with that I'll close and

559
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,690
saying you know introverts unite have a

560
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,669
great day thank you for coming thank you

561
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,730
for your attention and I'll see you

562
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,730
around
