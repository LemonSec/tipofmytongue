1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,680
it surprises all right I'd like to

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,230
introduce our next speaker Jonathan Lyte

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,349
you he's speaking on zoom' zero-day how

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,769
that's handle a vulnerability report

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:18,119
welcome John

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:21,330
all right so yeah so as I said before my

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,890
name is come on please now um yeah my

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,109
name is Jonathan light shoe I'm a

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,420
software engineer and security

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,960
researcher at great I currently work as

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,579
Gradle which is a build tool company

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,100
used for building java applications

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,180
around the world so and you can find me

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,790
on Twitter so I got into software

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,210
security in this space probably about a

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,550
year and a half ago where I found a site

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,840
I kind of realized that the barrier to

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,489
entry for finding security

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,010
vulnerabilities is actually quite a bit

20
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,269
lower than I expected and and started

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,250
finding vulnerabilities and started

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:03,239
poking and this ended up being one of my

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:08,070
pokes of curiosity so um let's talk

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,110
about so the agenda for this talk is I'm

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,908
gonna cover first the like discovery of

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,860
this vulnerability and the disclosure

27
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,360
timeline around this vulnerability and

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,890
then kind of my disclosure policy and

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,360
why I have the disclosure policy that I

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,790
use from there we'll go and talk about

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,140
the post disclosure timeline like what

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,860
happened after the vulnerability was

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,340
disclosed and and an analysis from the

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,990
perspective of zoom how they handled

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,560
this wrong so that it ended up kind of

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,560
blowing up from a media perspective to

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,610
look bad upon them and kind of the

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,619
things that they had to do to roll that

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:52,170
back so one of the big questions that I

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,020
get from people on a regular basis is

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,649
why were you looking at zoom and the

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,490
simple answer was I was curious I wasn't

43
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:08,610
really looking for a vulnerability a big

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:11,670
thing that for me was I was I was

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,990
looking sorry

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:19,559
so I was curious how you could go from

47
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,020
clicking a link like this to having a

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,590
web page open in your on your browser to

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,720
going to having a application local

50
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,110
machine running like what was that chain

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,060
of events that allowed that to occur and

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,170
how are is how is zoom doing this in a

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,030
way that was secure and like I mean my

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,859
initial thought was there might be some

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,260
communication from your get request in

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,540
the browser going through to their

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,700
servers and then bouncing back to your

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,549
client on your local machine like I was

59
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,250
curious how that worked and so right

60
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,930
like what is this black magic that's

61
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,880
going on behind the scenes that's

62
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,730
allowing this behavior to occur because

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,350
it is so seamless and so many people are

64
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,700
using it and we were using it in my

65
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,950
company at the time I was working for

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,820
flexi which at that time had been bought

67
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,470
by Hiller Packard enterprise and so yeah

68
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,269
so we were using it and so the first

69
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,330
thing that I did was I broke open the

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,360
chrome chrome developer tools and

71
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:21,120
started seeing this localhost

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,330
connections why are there localhost

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,760
connections and you'll notice that there

74
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:32,100
is a connection to something on port 19

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,810
421 and I was confused of like okay so

76
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,060
there's something running on my local

77
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:43,110
machine and it's talking it's making get

78
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:46,709
requests for images so it seems like

79
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,110
wha-why images and so I started to get

80
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,970
into the JavaScript source code and you

81
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,910
start seeing stuff like this right so

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,280
log start load load image right and so

83
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,579
first off why are they making requests

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,080
for images second off like instead of

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,800
making like regular request for like

86
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,010
JavaScript second off what is this thing

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
that's on my machine that is like what

88
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,859
is it doing

89
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,079
and the other thing that was like kind

90
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,859
of weird was there was this block of

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,580
logic where the response of the image

92
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,590
that came back like seemed to be like

93
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,430
this in oom and so what I found out was

94
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,030
that actually the response that the

95
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,380
webserver gave you was a image of a

96
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,258
certain pixel dimension and based upon

97
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,180
the pixel dimension you would return

98
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:36,009
these error codes right so a six by one

99
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,139
image was an invalid or as a fail

100
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,009
invalid domain right like one by one

101
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,750
image success and so that's how like I

102
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,600
was like okay like this is weird like

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,020
why are they keeping data back over an

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:56,820
image like that seems like really weird

105
00:04:49,020 --> 00:05:03,219
and so at this point right so so I had I

106
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:04,240
had been able to figure out that one of

107
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,810
the things so one of the things I ended

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,690
up trying from here was all right I see

109
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,030
that this logic exists on their site can

110
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,880
I make it say the same with rest the

111
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,698
zooms website is making from another

112
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,669
page right so I spun up my own website

113
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,660
and tried it and lo and behold making

114
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:27,490
the same get request for an image popped

115
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,870
my zoom client open but the the

116
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,419
component that was missing there right

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,150
so I was able to from that point I was

118
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:37,359
able to get you from my website which

119
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,669
was malicious supposedly right in the

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,169
attack scenario into I was able to get

121
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,760
you into a video call that your mission

122
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,320
or sorry into a call without your

123
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,139
permission the component that was

124
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,270
missing though was I couldn't get you

125
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,120
into a call with your video active

126
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,830
because default for zoom calls and you

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,380
create them is that your video is off

128
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,150
right so I'm like okay well I've got

129
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,889
part of the something here I've got you

130
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,000
into a video call but I don't know if I

131
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:02,560
would necessarily consider that a

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,259
vulnerability it's like weird behavior

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,270
probably not excused behavior but I

134
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:14,639
might not consider that a vulnerability

135
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:17,680
right so can we get video well no maybe

136
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,690
yeah actually yes you can and so how did

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,090
I so I ended up sitting on this one for

138
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:25,360
about a week I had to go on I went on

139
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,820
vacation when I came back I noticed that

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,039
when I was creating a meeting I was

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,960
using so I I normally did not create

142
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,419
meeting myself I either used like the

143
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,560
outlook client or something like that

144
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,299
but when I used this

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,430
application to create a meeting I

146
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,190
noticed something interesting this

147
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,290
little setting for participants where

148
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,800
you can set the participants to have

149
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,230
their video on by default when they join

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,140
the call and so if this if the what I

151
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,080
found out was that if you as a user had

152
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,870
not configured your zoom client prior to

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,450
like if you had just left it as the

154
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,670
defaults this setting would allow me as

155
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,190
the host when I set up the meeting to

156
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,410
tell your zoom client oh joy with your

157
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:16,670
video when you when you come to join

158
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:18,380
right so from there I went to private so

159
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,740
when I had the first component right

160
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,330
just around the video I reached out to

161
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,340
them over Twitter because I couldn't

162
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,840
find a security placed a report right so

163
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,030
one of the things that I'll do is I will

164
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,530
try to find a security location to

165
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,669
report something if I'll reach out to

166
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,460
the company over twitter saying hey

167
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,930
where is your security reporting thing

168
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,690
and usually you get it contact back

169
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,270
saying here send it to this email no

170
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,460
response with Twitter so I finally

171
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,190
opened a support ticket and that

172
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,460
actually got a response which is good

173
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,410
and so I laid out the whole details of

174
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,250
the vulnerability like here's the proof

175
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,770
concept with like a web website that

176
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,520
just joint like it's it's an image the

177
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:05,900
website was a simple image get requests

178
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:08,150
in any document this will join anybody

179
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,280
to a web browser or to a to a zoom

180
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:16,159
meeting without the permission and the

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,739
other component to this is I have a

182
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,470
disclosure policy and the disclosure

183
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,180
policy that I use is this this

184
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,440
responsible responsible exposure follow

185
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,270
schools 90-day vulnerability disclosure

186
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,130
policy I'm not an employee of Google I

187
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,570
just like their policy that's actually

188
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,580
something that I put in every email that

189
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,130
I send and then something that I've

190
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,600
since added since this zoom component

191
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,580
since the zoom vulnerability and more

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,500
recently is full disclosure will occur

193
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,090
either at the end of 90 day deadline or

194
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,140
whether whenever a patch made widely

195
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,730
available whichever occurs first and so

196
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,920
why I guess one of the one of the big

197
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,430
questions that we want to ask is why 90

198
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,910
days

199
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,819
right 90 days is Google's policy the

200
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,529
original I believe the original I had a

201
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,140
chat with Katie masterís about this who

202
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:04,160
has been doing vulnerability disclosure

203
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,959
for years and she said one of the like

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,670
original og vulnerabilities closure

205
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,170
deadlines was a week different times

206
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,319
also is much part of people to patch

207
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:19,270
things back then because there weren't

208
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,270
automated update processes right

209
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,940
Google's policy kind of I believe stems

210
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,800
from trying to wrap their disclosure

211
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,430
timeline around finding vulnerabilities

212
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,649
in Microsoft stuff and Microsoft's has a

213
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,120
one month release cycle right so they

214
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,089
release their updates every one month

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,220
and so this would this 90 days gives

216
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,930
three release cycles for Microsoft and

217
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,370
some of these big companies that have

218
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,739
some of those have long sort of release

219
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,510
cycles to get their fixes into those

220
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,850
release cycles in one of those fix

221
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,420
systems some companies of 90 days and

222
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,180
company said 45 days of disclosures but

223
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,020
I do fundamentally believe that

224
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,630
especially when you're shipping software

225
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,300
a disclosure deadline is important and

226
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:05,720
it for two components right one

227
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,729
component is it gives the company it

228
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,180
puts fire under the company to get it

229
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,240
fixed

230
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,069
because otherwise they can just let it

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,190
sit right it doesn't become a priority

232
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,480
unless there's a time line and the other

233
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,190
component is that it's important that

234
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,440
these things become public because if

235
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,180
they're not public then people don't

236
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,660
know that there are vulnerabilities they

237
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,859
need to patch right and so I also

238
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,079
regularly when I find horner abilities

239
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,279
in stuff I make sure that I get a CVE

240
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,980
number for the vulnerabilities that I

241
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:39,320
find and so when I send my email to zoom

242
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,660
I got a response and they said great

243
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,910
thank you so much here we will invite

244
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,240
you to our bug bounty program which they

245
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,800
did which was on it was it was a it was

246
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,649
a bug grant program they invited me to

247
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,199
the program and I started reading

248
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,450
through the rules and and the the rules

249
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,709
of their disclosure and this is this is

250
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,390
what I found

251
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,979
please note this program does not allow

252
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,390
disclosure you may not release

253
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,660
information about vulnerabilities found

254
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,390
in

255
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:10,219
program to the public and also their

256
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,780
payouts were low

257
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,200
it would have been between given what

258
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,400
was what I'd found they were I think the

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,980
payout they were looking at was between

260
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,810
three hundred eight hundred dollars and

261
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,610
so I my response was I can't in good

262
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,709
conscience participate in your blog on a

263
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,700
program given the terms of your polity

264
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:34,340
your program and so I said I will I'm

265
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,360
not going to disclose to through your

266
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,130
blog Bennett program I'm going to

267
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,400
instead choose to continue to use email

268
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:43,160
and there okay fine sure all right so

269
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,199
that's the that's the channel that we

270
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,949
continue to move through up move through

271
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,670
so after I disclosed this I started

272
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,020
poking around a little more and I found

273
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,920
some more things that were kind of

274
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:00,860
interesting so ID compiled the Xoom

275
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,880
client so here's the interesting thing

276
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,290
I ended up looking for so remember that

277
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,700
like that port I remember I don't

278
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,770
remember the number nineteen something I

279
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,260
ended up looking to see okay where is

280
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,480
the process that was launched on what

281
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,350
what process was bound to that port

282
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,660
right I found that this there was a zoom

283
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,510
application that was not in the zoom app

284
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,180
but was installed in your home directory

285
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,970
separate from the zoom app right and it

286
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,949
had a bit of code like get download URL

287
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:37,790
and I was like this is interesting and

288
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:40,820
that was gated by this logic which yeah

289
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,579
right so that's that's why I so it if

290
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,050
you look at it it says if r4 is equal to

291
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,000
string and then these are the different

292
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,370
strings that they had right and so I

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,110
wasn't quite certain I'm not very good

294
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,360
with decompiled code especially

295
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:58,640
objective-c but it looked like there was

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,230
some download logic going on where they

297
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,910
were allowing downloads from one of

298
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:06,320
these domains and I didn't have an

299
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,230
answer as to what was going on but I did

300
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,510
check out zoom gov comm and the doughnut

301
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,800
DNS record for that had been it was

302
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:19,120
about to expire in about four days

303
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,349
so I well ok four days there's another

304
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,790
component here I'll get there

305
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,380
so I also disclosed this to the the

306
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,020
chromium project and the Mozilla team

307
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,310
and the reason behind that was I was

308
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,740
curious I was not accurate in this but I

309
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,829
believed that Korres which is cross

310
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,570
origin request resource request

311
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:46,780
protections that browsers have in place

312
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:49,150
to prevent for example prevent you from

313
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,579
making a cross origin your website which

314
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:57,130
is like malicious cat videos calm can't

315
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:03,640
make a JavaScript or a JSON post request

316
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:06,570
to a resource like google.com right like

317
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,310
so they can't impersonate your account

318
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,920
similar protections I believe should be

319
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,170
in place around things like localhost

320
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,870
like the local IP system and I was like

321
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,969
you and browsers like why these systems

322
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,640
are not in place and the response was

323
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,560
there's there's there's a what's it

324
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,900
called an RFC input there's a RFC

325
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,660
inflight around fixing this but it's not

326
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,060
a bug in the browser so both of them

327
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,699
ended up closing it actually but then

328
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,920
Mozilla reopened it it wasn't a bug

329
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,600
against Mozilla Firefox they've reopened

330
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,760
it as a bug against their internal

331
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,200
infrastructure because it was zoom and

332
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:50,110
they were using zoom and so they they

333
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,380
ended up inviting me to a video call

334
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,480
with zoom to discuss this vulnerability

335
00:14:52,380 --> 00:15:01,180
which was the kind of video interaction

336
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,940
that I had with zoom about this and in

337
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,739
that meeting I brought up the DNS record

338
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,120
that was about to expire and I said I

339
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,220
don't know what this logic quite does

340
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,500
but it looks like there's some download

341
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,510
logic in here and that DNS records about

342
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,750
to expire if you let expire that might

343
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,890
turn in a remote code execution maybe

344
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,180
and their response was great we'll get

345
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,430
that fixed and it was fixed by the time

346
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,170
that I got home that evening so that DNX

347
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,800
DNS record had been refer at refreshed

348
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:28,750
and made

349
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:31,269
made sure they opted again okay so time

350
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,589
goes on time goes on at this time I'm

351
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:39,760
actually changing companies and at the

352
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:41,380
end of that we're getting very close to

353
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,050
the end of the 90 disclosure windows

354
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,760
that I gave them and and I'm telling

355
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,910
them guys like you guys don't know fix

356
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,019
out like you've had all this time what's

357
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:55,899
going on here and the the it was

358
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,550
probably about two weeks before the Anna

359
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,220
and I need just close her window where

360
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:04,599
they came to me and said here's our plan

361
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,399
for how we're gonna fix this and I ended

362
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,940
up saying well you got a hole here here

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:15,279
here and here and we had a discussion

364
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:17,410
and they were not the end vulnerability

365
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,070
that I'm finding but there were some

366
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,630
minor things with their fix around they

367
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,760
were gonna validate based upon the IP

368
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,200
address making the request and I was

369
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,209
like well if you have somebody else

370
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,649
that's on the same NAT is behind the

371
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,260
same NAT router as you you both have the

372
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,640
same IP address you can still perform

373
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,649
the same attack if you're both behind

374
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,569
the same that router and they said well

375
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:41,350
that's like I think that the opinion was

376
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:49,540
that's a much lower level attack right

377
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:51,130
and so we get to about four days for the

378
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,110
end of the 90-day exposure window and

379
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,149
I'm sending them emails I'm now on

380
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,450
boarding with my new company in another

381
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:00,490
country and I'm like look like I'm not

382
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:05,860
gonna have time to actually look at this

383
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,720
vulnerability so they did fix it four

384
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,708
days before my disclosure they fixed it

385
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,439
so my POC no longer worked and I told

386
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:16,329
them I said look if I find a bypass for

387
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,449
this fact if you had been willing to

388
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:21,129
work with me before like not four days

389
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,900
before the internet explorer window I

390
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,640
would in more than happy to have

391
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,250
reviewed this fix giving you guys

392
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,140
feedback followed up right but you guys

393
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,700
pushed it out pushed it out push it out

394
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,530
push it at the end of the nine days

395
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,130
if I find a bypass and going public in

396
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,129
24 hours

397
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,970
yes so we hit the public disclosure

398
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,649
deadline and life get in the way I had

399
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,690
just started a new job so I didn't have

400
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,320
time to go public the day of I was like

401
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,900
flying back from to the US that day and

402
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,550
the time that I actually had to sit down

403
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,620
and and and like write to begin writing

404
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,750
out my write up took me another two

405
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,669
weeks and around so I ended up sitting

406
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,840
it it ended up being 4th of July weekend

407
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:11,470
more actually had time to sit down and

408
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:16,209
write write up this write up right so I

409
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:19,030
called that got fixed right that's what

410
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,220
I thought and so I was like ok like I'm

411
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,139
gonna go write this up and we'll say yes

412
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,810
like they did fix it I'm not pleased

413
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,340
time but yeah they did fix it and like

414
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,050
here's the whole story right so I

415
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,879
believe that fundamentally that web

416
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,419
server they did leave that web server

417
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,930
behind right and and my thought was okay

418
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,090
like I don't know enough about this web

419
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,100
server and I'm don't have the skills I

420
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,179
still know the skills to decompile an

421
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,740
application like that and find

422
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,960
vulnerabilities in it but it's running

423
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,760
on lots of computers somebody else

424
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,110
should take a look at this and the only

425
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,450
way that I'm gonna be able to get that

426
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,459
is probably by publishing and getting

427
00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:00,090
somebody else to follow up on my

428
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:01,600
research hopefully but I found a bypass

429
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,370
for their fix

430
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:10,209
I simply loaded their website in an

431
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:12,969
iframe on my site and so I could just

432
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:16,780
have all of their code so what I found

433
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:21,400
was that my logic while it went my

434
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:23,230
original POC well it's just no longer

435
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,370
allowed you to join with a video active

436
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:30,520
it's still allowed you to get a video

437
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,370
call activated via the get request right

438
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,190
so my POC stopped working in the

439
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:38,739
component getting the video active but

440
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,230
when I ran their whole site is still

441
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,800
rejoin with the video active right just

442
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,020
like before and so

443
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,280
I just put their code whatever their

444
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,700
codes doing that's right

445
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,340
which I don't have to recreate on my

446
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,020
site and I hide it so for those are not

447
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,629
familiar my frames are way of embedding

448
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,570
other websites code in your site this is

449
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,610
how all ads are rendered right ads are

450
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,350
rendered in iframes to basically keep

451
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:10,350
that code that is untrusted contained

452
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,699
it's also a way of pulling off a couple

453
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,290
of owner abilities including things like

454
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,510
quick jacking so I started doing the

455
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:24,030
minute so I followed up and I said hey

456
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:26,460
zoom I found a bypass and I'm going

457
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:29,250
public in 24 hours I'm writing out my

458
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,890
thing and I said I will send I will send

459
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,260
you the full write-up a Fargo public and

460
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,820
I they were clearly not thrilled but I

461
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,490
mean there was not much they could do

462
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,990
about it they did say I mean one of the

463
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,730
things I said was well this is different

464
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,320
vulnerabilities and I said no I warned

465
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,330
you about that web server that web

466
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,310
server is probably a security

467
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,929
vulnerability and probably not something

468
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,370
that I would trust on my computer right

469
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:54,800
like in an arbitrary web server running

470
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:58,199
something and untrust an undocumented I

471
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,210
so I did some estimations and on the

472
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,590
number of vulnerable Mac's that were

473
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,860
possibly vulnerable list so this is only

474
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:08,280
on Mac which not on Windows but zoom as

475
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,770
of 2015 had like 40 million users and

476
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,470
Mac's right there about 10 percent of

477
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,300
the equals PC market and so they'd had

478
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,340
significant growth since 2015

479
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,450
so my estimation was about 4 million

480
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:24,870
Mac's were vulnerable to this

481
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:26,220
vulnerability far went public and what

482
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,320
about that don't download logic we were

483
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,350
looking at before right remember that I

484
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:38,510
couldn't figure out so what happens if I

485
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:38,510
uninstall zoom in reinstalled itself

486
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,930
what

487
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:48,890
now with my reaction so you can't even

488
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,720
protect yourself by uninstalling zoom

489
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,670
because this is blips the web server is

490
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,220
not in if you ever if you guys have a

491
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,260
Mac that's that web server is not in the

492
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,540
zoom tap file it's in your home

493
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,490
directory under a dot Jim US directory

494
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:10,379
which has that web server running right

495
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:12,390
so put that in my write-up so I went

496
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,430
public about this the next morning the I

497
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,690
dated s for next three hours which I

498
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,950
gave them because they're in California

499
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,110
and they wanted to have their team on

500
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,570
online or like okay fine sure yes that's

501
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:30,030
fine but public that was the headline

502
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:31,350
that I used I did not know about a

503
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,240
remote code execution but I thought

504
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:38,219
there might be one and then I had almost

505
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,890
found one but you know and so from here

506
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,320
I had a perfect so part of this was I

507
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,030
had a proof of concept in in the in the

508
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,250
write-up I had I had a link in the

509
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,690
write-up that said here if you want to

510
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,760
try out this vulnerability there are two

511
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,230
links one was with the just the image

512
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,360
which would not join in Viet with your

513
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,610
video and the other one was the one here

514
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,050
join with your video and split morning

515
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:00,780
like you'll be joined to a video call

516
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:03,720
with your video camera active just ahead

517
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,040
job and we ended up with what we called

518
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,040
chit the zoom chatroulette

519
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:14,110
yeah 4,000 votes on this tweet I think

520
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,850
if she got more tweet more more likes

521
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,330
than my own tweet about this

522
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,889
vulnerability yeah so this chatroulette

523
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,460
when they're running for about three

524
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:32,529
days straight

525
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:37,690
it was interesting yeah the Internet's

526
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:40,779
weird yeah but we also tried to be

527
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,149
useful this was one other thing so zoom

528
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:46,120
when it's an unmonitored soom meeting

529
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:47,889
you have a hard time controlling who's

530
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,479
in charge of presenting and you can't

531
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,480
take control of the presenter from

532
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,880
somebody else so when one of us that we

533
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,669
like we're responsible managed to wrest

534
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,809
control of the zoom meeting from because

535
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,539
I didn't even own the meeting it was

536
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:03,908
actually one of the demo links that they

537
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,220
gave me for making sure they're testing

538
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:08,169
our ability was fixed I just used their

539
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,830
link because it was longer-lasting than

540
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:14,500
my links I didn't have a count so I use

541
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,720
their link that they gave me for this

542
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,480
this example and so we put up like a

543
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,250
banner like this as a here's how to fix

544
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,960
this if you are here because you're

545
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,789
vulnerable right so we were trying to

546
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,970
help guide people into fixing this and

547
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:30,820
so we had a whole write-up that was

548
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,770
written by a Caron who's a friend of

549
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,720
mine that I met since this owner ability

550
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,210
as a part of this who like basically

551
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:42,580
brand like the whole like here's how to

552
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:45,940
fix yourself across this so across these

553
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,539
three days we had quite a few people

554
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,960
join we ended up with about 1,300 people

555
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:56,200
joining this this call if and that's

556
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,510
just the people that join while I had

557
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,390
was connected because every single time

558
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,950
you have somebody join you had your

559
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,720
leave it there icon downloaded to your

560
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,340
computer so these are all the icons of

561
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,640
people that were actually in the meeting

562
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:15,639
and so what was zooms initial response

563
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:18,370
to this not a vulnerability to quote

564
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,860
from them and their initial stance we

565
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,979
consist consciously enable the ability

566
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,449
to

567
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,039
meaning joins initiated from lead an

568
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,450
iframe on a webpage yeah right exactly

569
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,220
when I asked whether it was a concern

570
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,799
that such iframes require no click and

571
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,210
this is from BuzzFeed actually they

572
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,629
replied no that's not a security concern

573
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,070
actually interesting sidenote

574
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,110
when I posted my tweet about this

575
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,970
vulnerability first news organization

576
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,689
reached out to me which was kind of fun

577
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,340
was BuzzFeed did not expect they do some

578
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,080
really good reporting but I all the news

579
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,120
organizations through yet to me first it

580
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,490
was not expecting to be BuzzFeed I

581
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,649
didn't actually expect any news agencies

582
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,710
to reach out to me but you know even

583
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:04,100
what it is so this is a there's a

584
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,500
fundamental problem here right and and

585
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,699
the fundamental feature the fundamental

586
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,919
security vulnerability that I was that I

587
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,860
was exposing to them was their core

588
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,960
feature right their core feature was we

589
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,459
are one click join you to a meeting and

590
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,669
it's that right and I don't have

591
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,590
anything against that except for when

592
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:27,110
you can't do that in a way that's secure

593
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,000
and the PIA you can't that somebody else

594
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:33,649
can abuse to get you to that meeting

595
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,110
right and so I have not seen a video

596
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:39,439
solution as far as I'm aware that allows

597
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:41,120
that one click that doesn't potentially

598
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,190
have some sort of vulnerability in that

599
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:49,789
in that chain right so what about

600
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,100
Windows so interestingly enough Windows

601
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:55,100
do not have that wit that little doesn't

602
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,918
have the web server right but if you

603
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:01,158
checked this always allow these types of

604
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,230
links the in The Associated app this is

605
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,600
so this is a protocol handler zoom

606
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,610
meeting colon slash slash right you can

607
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,010
wet applications on your local computer

608
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:13,219
can register handlers with the operating

609
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,139
system for when these URL handlers get

610
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,090
triggered to get handled by various

611
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:18,860
snaps including your browser right if

612
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,120
you checked always allow these types of

613
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:25,250
links in in the associative app then

614
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,158
that you would not get prompted about

615
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,710
joining this call and zoom would just

616
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:34,909
pop open so Windows people were just as

617
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,759
vulnerable so back to the zoom

618
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:41,570
chatroulette

619
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:43,009
so yeah so we learned all this we were

620
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,799
also telling people right you need to

621
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,840
actually go and check these settings we

622
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:51,590
get to date - right so I went public on

623
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,869
Monday the 8th the 9th rolls around I'd

624
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,610
been up till 5:00 a.m. in the morning

625
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:56,990
that was a student just choice unlike

626
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,029
the act but yeah so 5 a.m. in the

627
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,980
morning looked for about 3 hours and the

628
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:02,570
next day the video call is still running

629
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,789
full ramp we ended up with about hundred

630
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:08,299
people consistently in the call at any

631
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:10,908
one time across those two days at around

632
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:12,200
2 o'clock 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard

633
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:16,149
Time

634
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:20,389
CEO zoom actually joins the call which I

635
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:21,498
I had not expected we had somebody

636
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:23,418
actually the night before that was

637
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,769
impersonating the CEO of zoom and said

638
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:26,960
that they were on the call with the fake

639
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,509
name it was not actually him I asked him

640
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,639
afterwards if it was him he said no but

641
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:38,690
the actual CEO of zoom Eric lund joined

642
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:40,129
the call and the he he we ended up

643
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:44,539
having a really interesting dialogue

644
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:46,340
with at this point myself Karan and 160

645
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:50,320
people in this video call at the same

646
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:52,580
time about this vulnerability and I

647
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,928
discussed the vulnerability we discussed

648
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,539
some other things we found out for

649
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:59,299
example that all video conferences in

650
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:01,580
zoom were unencrypted by default I had

651
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:04,070
since after that had a competitor so

652
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,840
like a day later had a competitor come

653
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,580
to me and say by the way we have a proof

654
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,408
of concept that can decrypt any like

655
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,019
that we can side-channel decrypt any

656
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:13,639
zoom conference in flight and so that

657
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,340
vulnerability

658
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:20,299
we also discussed various other things

659
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:24,649
like the the bug bounty that was the

660
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:28,279
payouts were low and and some other

661
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:31,789
other components and the end result was

662
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,820
that zoom ended up they made it they

663
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:36,408
made a step back fo r-the took a step

664
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,418
back and said you know what you're right

665
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:42,409
this is a vulnerability we will fix it

666
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:44,330
and they they did end up issuing a Patch

667
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:47,080
Tuesday night to get rid of that web

668
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,230
server the problem with that though is

669
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,220
if you enter ever

670
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,110
install zoom you would have to update or

671
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,770
reinstall zoom term of that web server

672
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:01,399
right so the web server it's like the

673
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,400
gift that keeps on giving

674
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,040
so yeah so so the things that he ended

675
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,380
up agreeing to is part of this meeting

676
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,790
right worth it they would remove the

677
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,590
daemon they did encrypt the chat by

678
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,840
default they'd have a public bug bounty

679
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,240
program or at least a public disclosure

680
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,580
like a vulnerability disclosure that is

681
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:26,429
public and increasing the bug bounty

682
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:29,809
payouts on their private program yeah so

683
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:34,770
they have since done that and then

684
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:36,149
thankfully Apple gets involved I really

685
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,410
appreciate the Apple engineers for

686
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,970
getting involved with this because there

687
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,160
was no way that zoom was gonna get rid

688
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,770
of that apples that web server because

689
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,230
if you would uninstalled zoom it would

690
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,480
have lived on forever on a lot of

691
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:52,200
people's computers that becomes more

692
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,549
important a little bit so also zoom got

693
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,290
a real fix out they now have a dialogue

694
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,629
preview window that pops up when you

695
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:03,720
join a video call it says I would like

696
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,270
to like I want to join like with my

697
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,669
video or with my video off likes and the

698
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,580
only downside of this is that checkbox

699
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,620
if you've been still disabled but at

700
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:21,049
least that point it's quite a bit more

701
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:25,199
willing so we're good right yeah so I

702
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:28,590
I'm just something but wait this morning

703
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,600
a gift that keeps on giving so risky

704
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,980
business I woke up on Wednesday morning

705
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,629
and I'm listening to risky business

706
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,710
which is really great podcast if you're

707
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,950
looking to for an information security

708
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,620
podcast that will wake you up and

709
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,830
realize oh wow the world's a scary place

710
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,809
I recommend risky business they open

711
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,340
with ya there's a zoom vulnerability but

712
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:48,750
by the way there's this remote code

713
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,418
execution boner really it's really easy

714
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,040
to pull off and I'm like well I can't

715
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,900
publish how do I not know about this

716
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,560
well because I'm you know I'm not that

717
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:04,130
good at decompiling code yeah so

718
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:07,790
on the 17th week later asset note

719
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:12,700
actually did a write-up of the remote

720
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:16,120
code execution vulnerability and yeah so

721
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:20,210
there is a way demo

722
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,350
yeah okay so remember that first bit of

723
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,740
logic where I said there was that if

724
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,600
check to check if like zoom if you have

725
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,550
is equal right so like going way back

726
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:34,010
like is equal some gavage calm right

727
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:35,330
there was this other bit of logic that

728
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,100
was in there afterwards

729
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,429
you guys bought the security

730
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,820
vulnerability here I didn't so don't

731
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:46,220
worry about it

732
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:49,790
um that right there is checking to see

733
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,740
if those same domains if it has the

734
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:56,090
suffix of that domain on the URL

735
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:01,190
provided so if you were to supply for

736
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:05,419
example that as your get request with

737
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,280
the domain attacked zoom us it would

738
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:13,610
parse it and it would say yeah that does

739
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:17,690
have the suffix of dot zoom us and you

740
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:24,649
could supply your own file from that

741
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:28,100
domain yeah so I'm yeah I missed that

742
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:31,190
one a little bit but yeah so they went

743
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:35,510
public with that and they have a proof

744
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:41,020
of concept let's see like in yeah so

745
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,020
they actually thanks to acid note yeah

746
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:51,500
yeah there you go and calculator yeah so

747
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:54,910
yeah so there was a remote code

748
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,910
execution vulnerability in that I server

749
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,600
this is still the gift that just keeps

750
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:07,219
on giving

751
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:10,790
oh come on now there's no white labels

752
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:14,750
are so this apparently very popular in

753
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:17,659
the the car industry where companies

754
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:20,630
will buy other companies cars put their

755
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,779
brand on it and resell it apparently

756
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:30,530
zoom was doing this with a couple

757
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:34,070
companies RingCentral yeah there was

758
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,620
there was like 13 this I only could find

759
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,620
logos for these five

760
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,239
but yeah so ringcentral which is really

761
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:44,000
big in the telecom industry Telus

762
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,719
meeting BTI BT cloud phone meetings

763
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,960
office week HD AT&T biz computing zoom

764
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,699
moon which is a Chinese version of zoom

765
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,070
zoom CN EarthLink get like so all these

766
00:34:52,699 --> 00:35:01,879
companies were all white labels of zoom

767
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:04,100
software yes earth blink earth link

768
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,680
meeting room was that was the yeah and

769
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:12,200
video conferenced elements and accession

770
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:14,240
meeting yeah so all these were also

771
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,100
vulnerable to the same wrote quote

772
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,779
excuse me vulnerable ad yeah

773
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,810
thankfully Apple stepped in again and

774
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,800
they've also removed all of these from

775
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,259
your computer so the thing that I

776
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,320
learned about Apple as part of this is

777
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,880
Apple has software that can remove

778
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,580
malware from your computer

779
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,320
they call it malar removal tool they

780
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,180
didn't consider zoom software malware

781
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,250
but it was the tool for the job so they

782
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,980
used it and I really appreciate that

783
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,390
they used it because now everybody the

784
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,230
four million plus people are not

785
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,790
vulnerable to remote code execution

786
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,140
vulnerabilities if they'd uninstalled

787
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,650
these applications and left the web

788
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,810
server behind so what about soon now

789
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,730
right they now own public

790
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,950
vulnerabilities closure system if you go

791
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,820
to zoom dot us slash security you'll

792
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,180
find out

793
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,440
to yield report vulnerabilities publicly

794
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,140
they now the staging area for 20

795
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,240
meetings and they are student Li ramping

796
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,359
up their security stance I can't really

797
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,919
state what I know but I've talked to a

798
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,050
lot of people and I know that they are

799
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,560
significantly improving their security

800
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:21,340
stance in this space they are doing

801
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,360
hiring and they are engaging in

802
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,910
conversations with the right people to

803
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:29,300
improve this situation in the future so

804
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:31,009
there is like a vested interest in

805
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:35,360
trying to prevent this from happening

806
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:38,110
again like they they yes so there there

807
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:42,050
has been learning in this area

808
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,410
what about browsers so no no we're good

809
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,550
we're good

810
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,190
I think we I think we've reached all the

811
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:52,780
drop like this like dropping sort of

812
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:56,270
moments so remember that that that like

813
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,490
join like zoom you're the URL protocol

814
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,450
handler you'll notice that the checkbox

815
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:07,160
is gone in chrome so yay awesome you now

816
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:08,870
have to always say yes and Firefox okay

817
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,310
well come on fire I have to actually

818
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,319
need to file I have an open issue with

819
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:20,000
Firefox and I need to follow up with

820
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:20,960
them so yeah so I kind of so just

821
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,190
tomorrow take a little bit of extra time

822
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,820
and just talk about like how this went

823
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,080
wrong right like couple components here

824
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,090
right

825
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,140
zoom they they handled this

826
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,750
vulnerability in such a way that they

827
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,270
they immediately took a vulnerability

828
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,360
was public and people could see and they

829
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:45,620
said no this is not a vulnerability and

830
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,120
so part of the I think that a

831
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,279
fundamental part of this was that the

832
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,600
culture at zoom and I think that we can

833
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,400
all like everybody in any of our

834
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,110
companies can get wrapped up in this

835
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,990
idea of what we're selling is like

836
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:02,960
awesome right and like we get to expect

837
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,430
behavior that we know about because we

838
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,860
have a deep and intimate relationship

839
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:09,770
with that technology right and for zoom

840
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,070
they were all about video conferencing

841
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:15,810
right they

842
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:19,650
they had a culture where the CEO and

843
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:22,980
this is what I've heard was that for at

844
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,680
that he would sit in video calls had his

845
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,390
desk and just invite people to come join

846
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,129
those video calls to talk to him right

847
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,160
like that was a fundamental part of

848
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,650
their culture was video is an open door

849
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,649
to come communicate with people right

850
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,470
and when somebody comes in and says your

851
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:42,210
core value add has a fundamental

852
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,220
security vulnerability about it that's

853
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,880
gonna be really hard for a company to to

854
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,850
listen to in here right and so one of

855
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,820
the components here was the ability to

856
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,220
kind of take your software and be

857
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,530
willing to think about it is no running

858
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,569
in this at certain scenarios like people

859
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,820
don't expect it to behave like this

860
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,220
right that can be really hard but it's a

861
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,030
it's it's important when certain

862
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:12,419
vulnerabilities like this come on right

863
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:17,520
the other component is there's this

864
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:20,300
analogy of two batons and when any

865
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:26,400
breach occurs or anything like that

866
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:29,400
there's two batons one is that the this

867
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,960
is not really a big issue right and then

868
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,530
there's the other side which is yeah

869
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,110
this is a big deal right and whichever

870
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:39,210
one you pick up the media is gonna

871
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,150
probably pick up the other one right and

872
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:45,360
so there's there's this component to it

873
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,520
where you kind of want to validate how

874
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,500
people are gonna feel about this thing

875
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,070
because if you don't you're an end up

876
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,780
having the public and the media possibly

877
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,760
take up that alternative view that you

878
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,400
don't want that the component is is

879
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:03,750
making sure that all the information is

880
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,730
out there job with its rolling back and

881
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:07,770
being willing to take an analysis of its

882
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,160
situation say you know what this was a

883
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:15,720
mistake

884
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:17,580
and we will fix it so yeah so the other

885
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,310
component that I don't have don't have

886
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:24,240
slide spoiler is the follow-up that I

887
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:32,099
had with both bugcrowd and after one

888
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:34,680
so after this whole disclosure Pollan

889
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,400
after this whole disclosure went through

890
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,509
one of the things that you'll notice

891
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,089
throughout bugcrowd

892
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:41,260
sorry and these programs is that a lot

893
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:43,180
of these programs a lot of companies

894
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,559
have private programs right they they

895
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,549
have companies that have private

896
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:50,770
programs on them and these private

897
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:53,170
programs usually have non-disclosure

898
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,000
agreements to them right no Lord much

899
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,819
well it's fine I don't need the slides

900
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,270
right now in case you don't worry about

901
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:06,400
it thank you

902
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:08,109
so the so hacker TSO hacker wanted in in

903
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,510
buck crab both have these these programs

904
00:41:08,109 --> 00:41:15,538
but there's no really good way of saying

905
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:17,950
like I have a bug in a company software

906
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,569
for example a company that runs there

907
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,558
they're bugging a program through hacker

908
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:22,960
one or bugcrowd

909
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,190
and and say I would like to disclose

910
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,299
this vulnerability but I don't agree to

911
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,599
the terms of the bug bounty program

912
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:30,640
right like I don't fundamentally like

913
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,430
the terms that I use don't the terms of

914
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,529
the grant program and interesting

915
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:39,098
response that I got from bugcrowd

916
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:44,079
which they have since apologized for was

917
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:45,760
an immediate response of yes like we're

918
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,170
really glad that you didn't disclose via

919
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,910
their program and and ordering using

920
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,440
their bugcrowd using their bug mentor

921
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,569
program and then try to hold it for 90

922
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,559
days close your window basically you

923
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:58,660
probably would have been evicted from

924
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,839
the platform had you done that and so

925
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,009
yes I'm very full that I didn't use cuz

926
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,430
I'd like to still be able to use

927
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,819
bugcrowd

928
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:08,078
in the future hacker one took a

929
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:10,960
different approach they actually changed

930
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,640
their policy around disclosure and they

931
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,599
added some guidance for people that

932
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,730
wanted to disclosure owner abilities not

933
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,049
that did not perform at the bug bounty

934
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,789
program for the company and they said

935
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:25,450
you can disclose it through disclose it

936
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,859
through us by our just general reporting

937
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,220
and they will guide you to the right way

938
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:32,250
to the right channels right so so there

939
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,250
there are

940
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,810
you there there are a lot of problems

941
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:41,109
with bug net programs currently where

942
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:44,190
it's hard to hold these companies to

943
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:46,359
disclosure windows because fundamentally

944
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:49,690
when they have these private programs

945
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:52,119
they say no disclosure they're kind of

946
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,220
buying your silence and I don't really

947
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,320
do that especially right in the zoom

948
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,089
case had I not gone public

949
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,410
happily probably wouldn't stepped in and

950
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,800
fix this right it wouldn't have in

951
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,600
public

952
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,510
nobody would have known about this and

953
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,819
and who would have come in to get rid of

954
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,840
this remote code execution from millions

955
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,530
of computers right

956
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,500
and so non-disclosure when it comes to

957
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:18,670
big issues like this can be really

958
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:21,940
really detrimental in a long-term and so

959
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,930
I think that public disclosure is an

960
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,700
important part of this process

961
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,350
especially when we have shipped software

962
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,109
it's not as necessarily as important

963
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:30,670
when you have a SAS service right that

964
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,259
the companies only sip their software

965
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,730
for but when you're dealing with the

966
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,160
stupid software that's sold like this

967
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,510
there should be CV he's assigned there

968
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,399
should be public disclosure of these

969
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,680
things and you should have a remediation

970
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,300
and you need to also maybe engage with

971
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:51,160
Apple to say hey we need to get rid of

972
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:56,230
this so yeah my new comeback oh please

973
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:59,740
I think that's about it for me my HDMI

974
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:05,560
connection has cut out now let's turn

975
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:08,229
off all right so dude I have second yeah

00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,530
what do you think and I've been like I

987
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,930
will have a look or I have other people

988
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,850
that I now know that can help you look

989
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,379
at things because there are other people

990
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,060
that I realize are out there that can

991
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:43,290
help you figure out the dynamics of the

992
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,610
vulnerability and so yeah so are there

993
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:59,790
any questions this time I'm yeah

994
00:44:44,610 --> 00:45:00,840
anything yes private I they so the

995
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,240
reason I can say they have a private

996
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,710
program is cuz they told they they have

997
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,259
a public thing that now says they have a

998
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,220
public but ever heard I do not feel

999
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,700
comfortable sharing that information

1000
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,020
because the information that I know is

1001
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:17,970
technically I'm in their program and not

1002
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:21,270
a lot to talk about so right late yeah

1003
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,709
so in response though I want to say so I

1004
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:27,060
did turn down the initial bug bounty

1005
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:29,730
program the CEO of zoom has I've since

1006
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:32,009
had a lot of conversations with him he

1007
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,830
did really appreciate that I went public

1008
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:39,210
about that well he's a preacher of the

1009
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:41,190
end results right and at the end of this

1010
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,560
whole thing I did end up with a sizable

1011
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:46,050
II larger bug bounty paid out I'm not

1012
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,210
gonna say how much but it netted me

1013
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,250
quite a bit more money and my college

1014
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,810
loans are quite a chunk off of that

1015
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,810
which is appreciated so yes

1016
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,129
yeah I haven't I don't have a number I

1017
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:12,470
yeah right yeah how many zeros right I

1018
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:18,170
know no I'd actually I I haven't

1019
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:22,490
actually so I'm not willing to disclose

1020
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:26,089
their I'm in their bug bounty program if

1021
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,140
I were to disclose the amount I would be

1022
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:29,900
at risk of getting thrown off with

1023
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,480
bugcrowd in general right and so I don't

1024
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,980
necessarily I I mean I could probably

1025
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,210
comfortably leave tsums bug gunner

1026
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,490
program because I'd probably disclose

1027
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,779
via their public Channel eat anyways in

1028
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,950
the future I probably would not use our

1029
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:42,440
private bug binary program because their

1030
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,118
rules are still non-disclosure right in

1031
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,369
that private program I would not use

1032
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,690
that right so I don't know that quite

1033
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:52,009
answered your question and as to my

1034
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:55,880
selling point I finally believe that

1035
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:59,960
user security matters right I also

1036
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:01,700
really like telling a story and you know

1037
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,539
like those two components tied together

1038
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,220
right like I don't want to be having my

1039
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:08,869
silence bought except for if I'm

1040
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,669
necessarily working for a company right

1041
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,160
like that I think is understandable when

1042
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,400
you're like finding vulnerabilities

1043
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,598
especially when there are

1044
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,999
vulnerabilities that are important to

1045
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,670
become public because they impact a much

1046
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:21,348
wider just like space you have shipped a

1047
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,059
piece of software and if you don't go

1048
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,309
public about it you're not necessarily

1049
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:27,499
going to get the response for a fix that

1050
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:29,299
you need for that vulnerability that's

1051
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:31,569
where is a serious problem so yeah

1052
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:31,569
anybody

1053
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:37,130
no I reached out to them I sent them the

1054
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:45,820
information this is dynamic they're that

1055
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:45,820
I also can't talk about anybody else

1056
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,880
yeah please also feel free to come up

1057
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,319
and talk to me afterwards like I'm happy

1058
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,600
to chat about it I guess afterwards so

1059
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,420
yeah I appreciate your time I appreciate

1060
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,940
your humorous laughter the only other

1061
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,859
thing is you know like the slide

1062
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,359
carousels were forms like carnivals

1063
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:06,410
appreciate them for giving me the nice

1064
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:09,080
backgrounds thank you all so much I

1065
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:13,440
really appreciate it

1066
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,440
[Applause]
