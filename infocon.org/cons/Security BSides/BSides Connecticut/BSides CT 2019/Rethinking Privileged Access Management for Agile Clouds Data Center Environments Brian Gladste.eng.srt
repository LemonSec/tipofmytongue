1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
from CMD he's got over 15 years of

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:09,019
experience in cybersecurity and I'll let

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,910
him introduce himself thank you so much

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:15,210
you guys hear me okay

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,529
great hey thanks for thanks for showing

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,330
up thanks for being here today I'm

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,270
really excited this is my first besides

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,948
talk so go easy on me but I'm actually

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,930
from Connecticut I grew up in Trumbull

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,740
so I was really excited to like come

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,660
down today and see you guys and gals so

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,930
I'm gonna be talking about privileged

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,820
access management on Linux and a little

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,760
bit of background well before I get into

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,260
anything I saw this on any you guys see

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,180
this on reddit just like a few days ago

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,160
I saw this on reddit just a few days ago

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,710
which I thought was very coincidental

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,919
given I'm giving a talk about this right

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,649
now

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,980
I'll give you a second to read it all

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,640
right

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,739
the chuckles tell me you've read it I

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,050
you know I I wanted to just put this up

25
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,570
there because when I think about

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,789
privileged access or access in general

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,700
this is just a reminder that it's a very

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,110
human problem to write there's you know

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,119
if you think about it what we're doing

30
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,740
is we're we're taking a computer and

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,470
we're telling a machine hey you have to

32
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,479
authenticate a person and here's some

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,479
rules that tell you how you're gonna do

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,850
that and once you do I'm trusting you

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,220
the machine to make that decision and

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,429
then from then on you let them do

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,079
whatever they need to do and that is

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,509
fine if you have a lot of right

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,949
technology but because there's a human

40
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,110
on the other end because there's humans

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,720
all throughout that humans could take

42
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,030
advantage of that and that's social

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,770
engineering that's hitting somebody with

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,409
a wrench until you get the password out

45
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,720
of them all these all these examples are

46
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,149
ways that people get around access

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,520
problems that hackers that attackers get

48
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,990
around access problems so I just thought

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,210
this was an interesting one it kind of

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,548
reminds me about the human angle of

51
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,369
security which is really really

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,930
important so that's kind of what I'm

53
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,758
going to talk about today is privileged

54
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,220
access management particularly as it

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,529
applies to Linux environments and I

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,540
talked about high velocity high

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,610
gaile you know data centers and clouds

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,730
these types of environments that have

59
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,890
really exploded in the last few years

60
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,440
we'll talk about what Pam which has been

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,540
around for decades but what it needs to

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,180
do today to operate well in those

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,590
environments how data and analytics can

64
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,850
actually solve some of the challenges

65
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,040
that we have with access in those

66
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,450
environments and then I work for a

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,790
company CMD we're getting ready to

68
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,890
release a free product so I'll just give

69
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,850
a little plug for that because this is

70
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:48,480
free so yeah I've been in cybersecurity

71
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,299
for 15 years 17 years actually I'm not

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,149
an analyst I've never worked directly

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
you know stopping threats what I do do

74
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,150
is I work with companies who are

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,700
developing innovative security

76
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,769
technologies I work at CMD now

77
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,540
previously I was at carbon black I was

78
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,230
at bit 9 in the early days I worked at

79
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,269
RSA back in 2004 on the security ID

80
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,149
token so I've kind of been in this space

81
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,530
for a really long time and I've done a

82
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,540
bunch of consulting for a lot of other

83
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,980
companies too the last few years I've

84
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,679
really spent a lot of time in threat

85
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,230
research and working with the data that

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,660
we're seeing in actual incident response

87
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,268
scenarios the data that we can collect

88
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,549
in clouds of all the activity that's

89
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,140
going around that's going on that's

90
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,930
leading to breaches and things like that

91
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,700
and working with these teams to

92
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,230
understand the story understand what was

93
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,560
happening and help communicate that out

94
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,358
and what was really interesting through

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,250
that experience because I love I

96
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,959
actually have a technical background I

97
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,390
got my computer science degree way back

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,370
when so yeah I can get a little deep in

99
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,048
the weeds there and what I think is so

100
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,870
interesting about that whole space is

101
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,989
kind of watching how attacker behavior

102
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,959
evolves and what we really started to

103
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,820
see over the last few years was all this

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,239
technology that we're building to keep

105
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,579
people out of where the goods are but

106
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,829
the truth is they get into those systems

107
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,870
and those systems are primarily Linux

108
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,000
these days there's so much information

109
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,470
that the attackers are after that is

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,529
sitting in the cloud and sitting in data

111
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,690
centers so so I just thought this was a

112
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,070
really interesting space right and as

113
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,169
much activity is happening in

114
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,480
cybersecurity

115
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,520
there was this this lack of

116
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,620
solutions for how do you really secure

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Linux and then a few months ago I got

118
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,700
introduced to this company CMD and they

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,950
said you know what we're gonna solve the

120
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,080
Linux security problem and this is my

121
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,820
first Tom Cruise movie reference of the

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,560
slide show so I just totally broke down

123
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,719
I said yeah you got me that's the space

124
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,000
that I just know there's there's a lot

125
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,810
of opportunity for security so I've been

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,550
at the company for three months now so I

127
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,500
want to kind of back up and talk a

128
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,670
little bit about the problem with Linux

129
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,670
security and just kind of do some

130
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,340
framing here and one of the biggest

131
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,560
problems with Linux security is so much

132
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,229
effort has gone into securing the

133
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,820
network and securing Windows and it's

134
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,850
not really hard to understand why that

135
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,640
is you know a few years ago Linux was so

136
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,010
much smaller than than it is today and

137
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,780
so for decades we've had to secure

138
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,950
networks and we've had to secure Windows

139
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,080
and many companies if they had Linux it

140
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,070
was a few boxes that people needed to

141
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,870
log into sometimes and you could treat

142
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,700
those boxes very much in the same way

143
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,280
you treated any other kind of Windows

144
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,710
box so you see a lot of vendor solutions

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,419
that were built for Windows and the

146
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,849
security problems of a Windows Network

147
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,060
and they port them over to Linux

148
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,100
and and those solutions don't

149
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,720
necessarily fit the problem that's over

150
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,790
there and this is one of the things that

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,010
I you know experienced for years working

152
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,170
in this industry is customers who really

153
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,330
are pushing the boundaries of Linux and

154
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,290
the cloud and these data centers in

155
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,370
these high scale DevOps environments

156
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,740
customers who are really pushing those

157
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,970
boundaries are just frustrated with the

158
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,160
state of the products that are out there

159
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,960
like many of you guys you probably know

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,780
how to secure Linux like IT security

161
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,180
Linux is a it's a securable platform

162
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,650
right there's a lot of information in

163
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,240
it's open source you can get in deep

164
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,270
there's a lot of capabilities in there

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,430
the problem is you know how do you roll

166
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,849
that out at scale in a high velocity

167
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:32,070
very fast changing environment Linux is

168
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,410
exploding it's you know 2.3 billion

169
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,570
public facing servers I think there's on

170
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,130
the order of 2 trillion servers that are

171
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,670
actually running like inside all these

172
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,409
clouds

173
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,310
it's just enormous and it's gonna grow

174
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,100
and grow and grow

175
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,050
you look at IOT security all the IOT

176
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,790
devices are built on Linux pretty much

177
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,220
Linux is is is is just exploding the top

178
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,680
websites all the top million servers and

179
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,150
the data of course is moving into these

180
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,030
systems as well and that's what the

181
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,190
attackers are after but the solutions

182
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,119
for securing these environments they

183
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:08,219
don't really exist when we look at this

184
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,370
is a this is a chart that Gartner

185
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,370
produces and this is workload protection

186
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,220
which is you know maybe a more advanced

187
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,110
version of server security but they used

188
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,330
to draw very similar chart with slightly

189
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,100
different terms that was just server

190
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,930
security so you can really look at this

191
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,840
chart and say yeah this is these are the

192
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,060
best practices for securing servers in

193
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,219
this chart and I'll just draw your

194
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,330
attention to the things that are at the

195
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,610
top which are less critical things like

196
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,159
anti-malware and even EDR is up there

197
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,270
but these are these are less critical in

198
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,979
these server environments but it's

199
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,310
actually where a lot of the products and

200
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,710
a lot of the the mature companies have

201
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,350
built products in these spaces the stuff

202
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,460
at the bottom is much more in the realm

203
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,930
of practice best practices good hygiene

204
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,969
all the way at the foundation we have

205
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,950
things like hardening configuration

206
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,360
vulnerability management how do you make

207
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,159
sure there's no arbitrary code running

208
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,990
how do you make sure privileged access

209
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,240
is locked down and changes are locked

210
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,789
down and you're capturing logs and all

211
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,280
that if you are building the system and

212
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,900
you know this you can build it there's

213
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,979
solutions for that there's ways of

214
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,659
building cloud systems with good hygiene

215
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:24,320
but think about how fast the cloud is

216
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,240
exploding and how developers are

217
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,039
cranking up machines quickly cranking up

218
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,660
environments they're deploying apps

219
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,468
quickly they're putting something in

220
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,669
beta and guess what it works and

221
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,200
customers are happy and their company

222
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,079
puts pressure on them and suddenly that

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,909
gets rolled out to production so so the

224
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,370
problem isn't really how do I secure

225
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,620
Linux it's how do I make sure that all

226
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,560
the people who are building out these

227
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,300
massive cloud systems and these

228
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,400
applications how do we know that they're

229
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,260
following the best practices that are

230
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,110
dictated by something like this

231
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,689
that's after a few months here and all

232
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,850
the years I've had in this industry this

233
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,370
is seems to be a huge huge problem in

234
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,200
Linux in these large environments is how

235
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,090
do I know that the policies I as a

236
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,410
security person how do I know those

237
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,300
policies are actually being followed

238
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,300
it's really hard to figure that out so

239
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,369
what do you have to do you kind of have

240
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,010
to assume that you've been breached and

241
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,470
even if this is a mental exercise right

242
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,230
even if this is alright I I don't know

243
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,360
that I can completely block everybody

244
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,460
from getting in but a lot of times if

245
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,950
somebody has a password if they were

246
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,720
able to get a rogue credential somewhere

247
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,690
if they were able to steal something off

248
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,460
the web or take advantage of

249
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,740
vulnerability on some system that hadn't

250
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,420
been updated and get in they might stay

251
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,940
there for you know a couple hundred days

252
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,579
before something actually happens and in

253
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,830
that time they're doing something so you

254
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,470
have to start to think not how do I keep

255
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,200
them out or how do I know when they're

256
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,550
just about to exfiltrate data but what

257
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,950
are they doing in those couple hundred

258
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,959
days right because that's your best

259
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,820
chance of finding them if you can find

260
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,760
them doing all the things that they do

261
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,250
to get from their initial access point

262
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,250
all the way down to the data that

263
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,470
they're after and the types of things

264
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,610
that they do are reconnaissance they

265
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,740
look around at the different machines

266
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,740
they see what the environment looks like

267
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,330
they probe they look for other accounts

268
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,810
that they can hijack so they can move

269
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,880
from box box from you know a low level

270
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,770
account to a higher level account they

271
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,420
look for software that's out of date or

272
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,939
vulnerable where they can trigger some

273
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,650
kind of an exploit and trigger higher

274
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,110
privileges they move from machine to

275
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,400
machine all these things are the types

276
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,610
of activities that happen after the

277
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,640
breach but before these the incident

278
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,400
right problem is these are really hard

279
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,260
to detect we just really don't have

280
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,680
visibility if you've got you know

281
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,960
thousands of servers running in a you

282
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,359
know a typical cloud formation and

283
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,370
you've got a trap all that and all those

284
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,890
logs are coming in it's really hard to

285
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,990
find the one instance of somebody

286
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,090
probing from one system to another

287
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,900
system there's a he

288
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,310
you can see it right every day the only

289
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,740
thing that happens on most of these

290
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,359
servers is they get rebooted and one day

291
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,460
somebody runs a couple extra commands

292
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,960
and that should be super suspicious and

293
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,670
as people we can look at this we could

294
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,430
say man I really want to know what was

295
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,430
happening on October 27 like give me all

296
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,229
the information around that but the

297
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,150
types of solutions that are out there

298
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,310
for gathering and correlating all this

299
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,870
data could be really hard to spot this

300
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,969
this is a needle in the haystack but

301
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,160
it's a pretty compelling needle if you

302
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,160
can find it it's really hard to get it

303
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,470
so it makes you think that something's

304
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,410
really wrong with the way we do Linux

305
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,610
security we're kind of approaching it a

306
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,420
little backwards we don't have the right

307
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,890
solutions instead of focusing on hygiene

308
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:04,439
the market is focusing on these

309
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,810
higher-level solutions what we really

310
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,300
need is how do you give an IT security

311
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,160
professional the tools the visibility

312
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,609
the control that they need in these

313
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,520
vastly changing large Linux environments

314
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:21,570
right so that's kind of where where we

315
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,960
started so how do you solve this so I

316
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,000
want to kind of talk a little bit about

317
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:30,450
starting from scratch right and I'm

318
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,940
going to go back to this diagram and say

319
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,520
all these security solutions that you

320
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,920
have on top of this if you don't have

321
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,170
good hygiene across your environment

322
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,329
it's really hard to implement a good

323
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,280
security solution and so let's start

324
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,590
with that foundation of hygiene how do

325
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,959
you harden your configuration your

326
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,800
vulnerabilities how do you make sure

327
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,230
that you're doing the right things

328
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,339
operationally and I and I think this is

329
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,190
really interesting when you actually

330
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,300
look at these individual foundational

331
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,350
elements right so there's four of them

332
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,750
I'm gonna start with log management

333
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,520
because I think most companies do pretty

334
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,260
good log management they there's a lot

335
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,569
of products out there you can suck all

336
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,430
logs into a sim or into some other kind

337
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,960
of log management tool you get all that

338
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,819
stuff out there now the quality of your

339
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,840
logs may be a different story but at

340
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,030
least you can do

341
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,540
fair amount of log management but some

342
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,040
of these other things are really

343
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,529
are actually really hard in these

344
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,290
environments so look at no arbitrary

345
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,970
code no email or web client probably

346
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,000
you're not running an email browser a

347
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,980
web browser and in a in a Linux cloud

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,570
that you're spinning up but how do you

349
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,209
know that you don't have arbitrary code

350
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,339
running like you'd like to believe that

351
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,560
there's no arbitrary code running but

352
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,360
hey if somebody's got root access and

353
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,040
you don't know that they went and

354
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,380
downloaded some binary just to try it

355
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,870
out somebody's responding to an incident

356
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,760
and they needed a tool and it wasn't

357
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,560
tracked or recorded right but they

358
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,019
needed it right then there's actually a

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,989
lot of instances where arbitrary code

360
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,260
does get run in these environments and

361
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,000
it ties back to how did you manage the

362
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,269
privilege that allowed somebody to do

363
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,310
that in the first place and change

364
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:13,899
management and similar story how do I

365
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,699
know that the changes that are happening

366
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:19,260
are the changes that are supposed to

367
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:21,819
happen when I look at a high velocity

368
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,010
DevOps environment a see I see the

369
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,110
environment I've got code dropping into

370
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,939
production multiple times a day you

371
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,970
really have to trust that all the right

372
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,970
steps are happening right it would be

373
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,279
great if dev sec ops was real if we

374
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,980
developed code and tested it and tested

375
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,540
it for security unit by unit and rolled

376
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,010
it out into production and Matt all

377
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,870
worked great that would be wonderful

378
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,180
but that's not really how most

379
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,360
organizations operate at this point so

380
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,310
you do these changes and the volume of

381
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,540
change is significant and how do you

382
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:54,459
really know the right changes are

383
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,990
happening if you don't have good

384
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,518
privileged access management it's

385
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,089
actually hard to really even tell that

386
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,089
so we look across these and I think in

387
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,980
Linux a lot of the problems here come

388
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,279
down to the way privileged access works

389
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,649
in Linux right if you solve that you can

390
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,079
bubble that up and improve hygiene all

391
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:19,060
across all across the board here out of

392
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:21,459
foundational level and privileged access

393
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,369
on Linux is a security hole big enough

394
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:27,189
to drive a truck through and what do I

395
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,569
mean by that well once you get access

396
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,610
you can do anything that that account

397
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:32,649
lets you do you can do anything on a

398
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,200
Windows environment you've got GPOs

399
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,570
right you can as a Security

400
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,180
traitor you can set policy that even a

401
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,250
Windows administrator has to at least

402
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,709
jump through hoops to get around and

403
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,630
those hoops you can track but most

404
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,820
Windows administrators are not bad

405
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,890
people they will hit one of those

406
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,180
guardrails and realize oh I I guess I'm

407
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,130
not supposed to change that I better

408
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,319
find another way instead of actually

409
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,710
trying to actively subvert the policy

410
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,720
none of that exists in Linux if you get

411
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,450
root access you can do anything your god

412
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,270
and there's no protection there's no

413
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,020
guardrails from threats from errors from

414
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,610
mistakes

415
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,560
somebody could log into a production

416
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,600
environment thinking it was a test

417
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,000
environment make a change install a

418
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,130
install a tool to help them debug a

419
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,170
problem leave it there by accident that

420
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,790
tool has a vulnerability in it there's

421
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,740
all sorts of errors that can happen

422
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,300
along the way and you don't have

423
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,350
visibility and you don't have guardrails

424
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:34,189
to keep that from happening

425
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:36,490
I I've used this picture I've used this

426
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,750
scene you guys know what this is from

427
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,180
does anybody not know what this is from

428
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,610
maybe I'm just like super old but like

429
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,709
this is like a classic you know seeing

430
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,390
this is one of the classics Mission

431
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,980
Impossible I just was reading about this

432
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,620
Tom Cruise did all his own stunts in

433
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,450
this too like a the one where he's lying

434
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,200
like an inch from the floor he actually

435
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,760
that was all real and all him but I'll

436
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,060
set it up right so this scene they're

437
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,920
trying to get the the list of agents

438
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,829
that's stored on this computer that's in

439
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,349
the secure facility in the secure super

440
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,980
secure room inside this even more super

441
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:16,730
secure facility and and there's all this

442
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,680
technology that exists as he if he were

443
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,240
to walk directly into the room you know

444
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,740
scanning and biometrics and all those

445
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,030
other stuff that that way he would

446
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,069
immediately trigger and he wouldn't be

447
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,589
able to get in so what they decide to do

448
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,629
is wait until the room is out of

449
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,639
operation right nobody's in there

450
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,070
nobody's logged in and they sneak in

451
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,580
through the ceiling and and the thing is

452
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:39,710
the room is making sure nobody can sneak

453
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,840
in because the floor is touch sensitive

454
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,870
if he steps on the floor if there's like

455
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,860
a drop of sweat lands on the floor it's

456
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,590
going to trigger the alarm

457
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,939
I think there's temperature controls in

458
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,209
the room so they have to like keep the

459
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,919
10

460
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,740
sure at the right thing there's noise as

461
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,140
microphones so if he's too loud it's

462
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,029
gonna set off the trigger right so he

463
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,860
they go through all these gymnastics and

464
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,649
then he's you know kind of fly in there

465
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,939
right above the keyboard and he goes to

466
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,070
the keyboard and he types in the

467
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,890
password that they stole and he puts a

468
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,658
disk in the in the machine and he

469
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,360
downloads this super secure list that

470
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:18,470
all this technology was built to protect

471
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,059
to make sure nobody downloaded it now I

472
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,130
wonder why there's a floppy drive on

473
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:26,809
this machine in the first place right

474
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:29,470
that seems a little ridiculous but if

475
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:33,340
you think about it it's really good

476
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:35,929
parallel to the way like development and

477
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,480
operational security kind of work right

478
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,279
a developer built this machine a

479
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
developer built the system that holds

480
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,690
the data they weren't really thinking

481
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,610
about security at the time if they were

482
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,230
they might have put in something on that

483
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,620
machine to make sure that you know what

484
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,120
you can't log in if if the door is

485
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,918
closed and we're in the off mode in the

486
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:01,459
room right you might say um every time

487
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,230
somebody logs in they're walking on the

488
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,580
floor and I can detect that and this

489
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,320
time somebody's logging in and there's

490
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,879
nothing on the floor maybe that's maybe

491
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,600
that's risky maybe there's something

492
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,850
wrong there right there's all this data

493
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,490
that the security people had to build a

494
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,580
really large sophisticated fence around

495
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,610
this thing that the developer built to

496
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,529
make sure that nobody could penetrate it

497
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,110
to the point where the weak security is

498
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:28,909
exposed right there's so many things

499
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,620
that if you actually tied in what's

500
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:32,059
happening on the system to what's

501
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,340
happening in the room there's so much

502
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:37,010
data there that would make this whole

503
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,570
thing just a ridiculous concept right

504
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,220
and I think I've used this

505
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,110
I think this scene I've used it actually

506
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,940
multiple times and talking about

507
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,340
multiple different security issues I

508
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,980
still think it's a great scene fantastic

509
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,689
movie um but it really illustrates I

510
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,549
think what happens when you have

511
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,409
development and security and they're

512
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,370
kind of separate and they're not sharing

513
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:57,860
data and they're not sharing information

514
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:01,158
and they're not building secure systems

515
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:03,889
and it would be great if those groups

516
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,330
work together from the beginning but

517
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,860
a lot of times it's just not reality

518
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,110
right

519
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,919
[Music]

520
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:15,860
even linus torvalds and this is only a

521
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,650
few weeks ago finally admitted that this

522
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,240
hole in route security is something that

523
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,450
should be addressed that there should be

524
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,240
a way to lock down a kernel in Linux

525
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,450
even if somebody's logged in as root

526
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,309
right

527
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,650
he pushed back on this for a long time I

528
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,020
don't really know why but he pushed back

529
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,360
on this for a long time a lot of the a

530
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,299
lot of the flavors of Linux have

531
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,330
actually put this technology in so it

532
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,549
was out there but there was a resistance

533
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,850
you know all the way up to Linus himself

534
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:48,918
for getting rid of this idea that a root

535
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,469
user is essentially God and I think

536
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,179
times have changed enough now where yeah

537
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,280
you know what we need to have some cure

538
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,610
some security controls even for a root

539
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,168
user but that's not how most of the

540
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,659
systems that are in operation now are

541
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,600
working so we have this hole and it's

542
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:08,390
something that we have to deal with now

543
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,980
how do you deal with access today well I

544
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,290
kind of mentioned earlier a lot of these

545
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,750
access control solutions were built for

546
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,510
Windows and then ported over to Linux

547
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,040
and and so I mean without naming like

548
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,900
who these tools are I just wanted to

549
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,700
show like some of the techniques that

550
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,090
you see for how you deal with privileged

551
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,429
access out there this one it's it's very

552
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,820
much like a Windows administrators view

553
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:33,530
right okay I've got not a thousand

554
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,559
servers that I'm trying to manage or a

555
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,030
bunch of you know ephemeral or ephemeral

556
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,950
servers right servers that are coming in

557
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,899
and drop it out and containers and all

558
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,000
that but I have a list of servers that I

559
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,210
can browse through and identify and I'm

560
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,820
gonna want to log into one of them and

561
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,740
and not supply password I'm gonna grab

562
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,500
it out of a vault so it's one time and

563
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,990
it can be tracked to me it's it's built

564
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,419
through this proprietary tool so if you

565
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,150
are in DevOps and need access to that

566
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:04,400
server it means you've got to go out of

567
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,200
your workflow and go into some other

568
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,730
browser and log in to some other system

569
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
and grab the password and bring it back

570
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,000
that's not how DevOps likes to work

571
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,400
that's not how people who build in Linux

572
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,650
like to work you don't have any control

573
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,120
once they get in they get in with root

574
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,220
access they can do whatever they want to

575
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,600
do

576
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,390
this is another one that's a little

577
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,949
newer a little more recent it gets rid

578
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,650
of the password vault it's got some

579
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:31,190
other benefits over some of the older

580
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:33,590
Pam stuff but it still does not strike

581
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,490
you as yeah this is the way Linux is

582
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,409
supposed to work

583
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,440
all right people who work in Linux they

584
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,140
love Linux like it's a it's a it's a

585
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,140
lifestyle almost it's a it's a way of

586
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:50,930
working and it's not this totally

587
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:52,910
different world when you go there so so

588
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,830
where are we so we've talked about kind

589
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,650
of the problem with access on Linux and

590
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,960
we've talked about the state of the

591
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,790
tools that exist to protect that access

592
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,160
and so now we're at a point you know

593
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,420
what what if we took a totally different

594
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,450
approach what if we started from scratch

595
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,250
and said if we were gonna build a

596
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,340
privileged access system for today's

597
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,400
Linux you know with DevOps with cloud

598
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:20,000
with massive data centers with high

599
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,190
velocity code changes with developers or

600
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,020
operators who need root access to solve

601
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,420
problems because problems happen all the

602
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:30,170
time with containers we were gonna start

603
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:32,780
there what would it look like so I think

604
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,960
there are there are four things that you

605
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,860
need in this kind of environment if

606
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,330
you're really gonna have solid

607
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,000
visibility and control over who's

608
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,610
logging in and what they can do so the

609
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,370
first one is a hundred percent identity

610
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,260
based tracking everything that happens

611
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,899
should be tied to an individual that you

612
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,129
can recognize right now in Linux you

613
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,110
have shared accounts it's so easy to

614
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,110
take an account take a password and pass

615
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,790
it over to somebody else like that it

616
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,070
would be great if you could disambiguate

617
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,740
that and you know that you know brian's

618
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,750
password or Brian used the shared

619
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,120
account on this instance but Sam used

620
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,770
the shared account in that instance so I

621
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,229
think we need this we need a hundred

622
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,670
percent identity based tracking the

623
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,290
second thing we need to do is we need

624
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,810
access control not at the session level

625
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,550
but at the command level it's fine if

626
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,990
you want to browse a directory it's not

627
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,440
fine if you want to dump a customer

628
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:31,220
database we should be able to get

629
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,470
granular enough to create those rules

630
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,050
then we need detection and remediation

631
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,420
of access gaps so what that means is if

632
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,540
somebody is doing something that they're

633
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,930
not supposed to men send me an alert let

634
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,159
me know you know tell me this person did

635
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,050
something that they're not supposed to

636
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,990
and there's an opportunity to fix it

637
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,970
right and we don't fix it by putting

638
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,860
anti-malware signatures in the way you

639
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,600
do on Windows you fix it by going back

640
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,189
and changing the configuration of Linux

641
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,659
or changing the configuration of the

642
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,000
container that's what we do in the Linux

643
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,710
world so so you need to be able to

644
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,630
detect those gaps and you need to be

645
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,580
able to remediate them and then lastly

646
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,170
it's got to be DevOps friendly if your

647
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,419
developers and your operators if they

648
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,220
have to jump into another tool if it

649
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,160
doesn't fit with their tools in their

650
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,840
workflow they won't use it and anybody

651
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,060
with a credit card can pull their credit

652
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,699
card out and open up their own account

653
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,649
and start doing stuff and integrated in

654
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,820
you want to make it as easy as possible

655
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:31,880
to for the rest of your developer and

656
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,590
operational organization to actually use

657
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,990
it and that means take the

658
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:42,280
responsibility out of their hands right

659
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:44,240
put it into the IT security hands and

660
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,139
these are different than what's

661
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,070
available today so I'll call it old Pam

662
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,320
I wanted to find a picture of Pam from

663
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,840
the office like through one of those age

664
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,120
filters and put it on here but I

665
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,240
couldn't find that so I'll just settle

666
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,239
for name old Pam so so old Pam

667
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,620
identities are only tracked with their

668
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,680
only tracked if you go through these

669
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,510
proprietary access methods so you're

670
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,300
used to writing pseudo well now you have

671
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,850
to write something else do right you're

672
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,409
used to just logging into a machine now

673
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,730
you have to go get a credential from

674
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,230
somewhere else and you have to drop in

675
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,360
so only if you use these proprietary

676
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,160
controls you only have session level

677
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,919
access control are they allowed to login

678
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,540
or are they not allowed to log in and

679
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,530
there's no detection or remediation and

680
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,050
they're really built for the windows

681
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,250
case so we need something kind of

682
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,840
different right and it's got different

683
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:40,010
requirements now to do that we start to

684
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,990
think all right well how do you do that

685
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,250
like what would you need to do you're a

686
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,470
security professional you want to put

687
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,649
those requirements in place

688
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,090
you need a lot of data and that's what

689
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,649
I'm going to talk through next is like

690
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,500
what kind of data do you actually have

691
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:56,570
access to and how would you use it to

692
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,700
solve to address these requirements to

693
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,820
fulfill these um and it's kind of like

694
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,070
what we're doing is saying all the stuff

695
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,080
in the Tom Cruise room in the white room

696
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,990
we're actually gonna plug it into that

697
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,908
login console on the computer and in

698
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,559
fact onto every command that he issues

699
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:14,590
right into the operating system so

700
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,879
everything knows the state of the room

701
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:20,269
where he's hanging and dangling right

702
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,760
there so you get that data you put it

703
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:24,980
centrally you can build monitoring and

704
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,110
detection on top of it you can use it to

705
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,110
define policies that are really granular

706
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,889
and you can use it to enforce control

707
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:35,870
what's actually happening and so that's

708
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:38,120
kind of the model here totally different

709
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:41,809
way from the way access management is

710
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,580
done today alright so now what I want to

711
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,408
do is walk through what some of that

712
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,279
data looks like and some of the work

713
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:50,570
that we've done with customers and if

714
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,700
you were going to be doing some of this

715
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,950
stuff like what kind of data would you

716
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,510
need to suck in and how would you want

717
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,070
to evaluate that what kind of stuff

718
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,250
would you need to do to make these

719
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,620
decisions as you go and what you find is

720
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,659
that like this is hard there's a lot of

721
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,668
data available you can just imagine the

722
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:10,820
volume of data we've collected like 40

723
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:13,279
billion data points at this point

724
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,740
command-line arguments that we're using

725
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,539
with all this context and we're starting

726
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,659
to see some really interesting patterns

727
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:22,250
and we see them even with a single site

728
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:24,200
but it's a very different way of solving

729
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,740
this problem so what kind of data is

730
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,289
available to us right we've got there's

731
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,549
actually a lot of data with that comes

732
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,070
with the command line that you can

733
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:36,679
capture so you know when the command was

734
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,330
executed you know who did it whoever was

735
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,059
logged in maybe not the specific

736
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,189
identity but whoever that login user was

737
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,899
you have all the data that's on the

738
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,820
command line itself you know how that

739
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:48,168
command line was issued is it an

740
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,510
interactive session or was it done

741
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,100
through a shell script and on and on

742
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,139
it's actually a lot of information

743
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,340
that's sitting in the room right there's

744
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,899
a lot of information that if that

745
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,470
computer was connected to the rest of

746
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:01,820
the room could make a much smarter just

747
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,600
so first we have to collect all this we

748
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:09,320
have to pull it together and then you

749
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,600
got data science data science in this

750
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,970
area is actually pretty hard just like

751
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,189
it is in security in general and I think

752
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,740
one of the biggest reasons one of the

753
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,240
biggest things that makes it hard it's

754
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,530
actually the second point on here is the

755
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,130
fact that security data is not

756
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:29,420
stationary so I can set up a machine

757
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,940
learning algorithm to identify a bowl as

758
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:34,250
opposed to a fork or a spoon because

759
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,080
bowls don't change I mean they may

760
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,520
change a little bit but basically bowls

761
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,699
have certain characteristics that don't

762
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,200
change forks and spoons same story but

763
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,820
security there's a human on the other

764
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,320
end

765
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,300
security tactics change all the time

766
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,210
attacker tactics change all the time

767
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,190
they try new things so you're not

768
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,210
working with a stable data set you're

769
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,430
working with the data set that's

770
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,840
actually always evolving that may that

771
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,280
means you have to constantly be

772
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,199
retraining your algorithms on this data

773
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,580
so that makes it hard the assumptions

774
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
that you make about that data to the

775
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,360
first point make it hard to those

776
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,970
assumptions can have big big

777
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,409
consequences one way or another it's

778
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,050
actually hard to get accurate training

779
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,670
data so nobody is sitting there saying

780
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,040
here's all the commands that were run

781
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,050
and who ran them like you have to get a

782
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,480
lot of good training data in that's

783
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:25,610
reliable in order to create these

784
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,680
algorithms so it's hard to even

785
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,600
accumulate that much data the data may

786
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,610
not be rich enough you may not know the

787
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,679
features of the data you have to be

788
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,800
really accurate and how you classify the

789
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,830
data all this stuff makes data science

790
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,360
hard in this realm but as we start to

791
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,889
look at it and we start to see it

792
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,260
because there's so much of it happening

793
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,820
we got a large pool we can actually

794
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,120
start to build some pretty decent

795
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,760
algorithms out of it and then we can

796
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,590
start to do really interesting things so

797
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,090
there's a bunch of stuff that we could

798
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,040
do with this information if you know

799
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,810
every command line and all the context

800
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,940
around every command line you can start

801
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,290
to model user behavior and that's the

802
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,840
one I'm going to dive into so I have a

803
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:08,270
few I kind of walk you through what that

804
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,280
actually looks like and in actually real

805
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,950
terms but you can detect share

806
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,899
credentials you can detect in true

807
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,520
you can prevent sensitive information

808
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,080
hacking there's a lot of stuff that you

809
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,410
can do with this information at that

810
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,879
granular level once you have it well

811
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,450
let's dive into that user behavior

812
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,799
modeling scenario so the so this data

813
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:32,510
here these next few slides are actually

814
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:36,350
from a real site where we collected data

815
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:37,340
and we ran these algorithms and and we

816
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,010
actually discovered some interesting

817
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,370
interesting things going on that the

818
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,809
that the site didn't know about so first

819
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,969
thing like obviously we've changed the

820
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:50,360
names it's not really Bob and Alice and

821
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,799
all them we just put those names in so

822
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,240
what we're looking at here are set of

823
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,639
six users that had access to this

824
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,700
environment three of them are active

825
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,580
three of them are active today and the

826
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,679
height here in the purple or the gray

827
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,530
that shows kind of their average number

828
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,200
of sessions per day the green is how

829
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:12,200
many sessions those users are have

830
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,919
executed just on this day today right so

831
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,570
we're gonna look at Bob Bob is this is

832
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,150
his third session of the day and

833
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,620
typically he executes I don't know like

834
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,929
eight or something like that whatever

835
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,379
that number is but you can kind of see

836
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,880
just that that average across all these

837
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:33,799
obviously if somebody one day logged in

838
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,720
a thousand times that would be a flag we

839
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,660
can look at these three sessions that

840
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,390
Bob executed and we can start to look at

841
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,070
the commands so what was he doing be

842
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,270
nice to know what he's doing and it

843
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:50,090
turns out two of these sessions looked

844
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:53,418
similar to each other he executed a lot

845
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,830
of route commands but one session was

846
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:58,970
different and he was executing a lot of

847
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:02,030
file commands now knowing Bob's job as

848
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,040
an administrator he's really there to

849
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,649
make sure the machines are healthy he's

850
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,540
not there to move files around so maybe

851
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,460
there's something interesting there now

852
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,610
if you're just looking at those command

853
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,260
levels you know no no analysis is going

854
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,260
to just trigger and say oh somebody

855
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,400
catid a file that's got to be bad but

856
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,620
what we're trying to do is build a

857
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,940
picture here across all this information

858
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,939
so that stands out

859
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,809
we can pull in some more information

860
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:32,510
where did he go login - sorry where did

861
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:34,190
he login from and again we see a

862
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,039
discrepancy between the first and third

863
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,360
session in the second session so in the

864
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,220
first and third session he was logging

865
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,928
in from a private IP address in the

866
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,720
second session he was logging in from a

867
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:46,610
public IP address and we rewind the tape

868
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,669
and look historically and it turns out

869
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,559
hey there's actually a series of

870
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:53,330
sessions over over the last you know

871
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:55,428
week or two weeks or whatever this time

872
00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:00,530
frame was where he's logged in from

873
00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:02,330
public IP s now maybe the system doesn't

874
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,740
have the right access control you know

875
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,629
there's a configuration somewhere maybe

876
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,280
nobody ever thought to make sure that

877
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,530
you can only access this environment

878
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,409
from a private IP maybe that control was

879
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:18,020
never put in place but it's interesting

880
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:20,389
to see it so we dive a little deeper we

881
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,918
take a look at the next thing which is

882
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,320
alright so we know where he came from

883
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,888
now what systems is he act accessing

884
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,020
internally and remember his job Bob's

885
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:32,659
job is to make sure that the systems are

886
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,399
healthy and so you could see to these

887
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:37,399
sessions actually in all these sessions

888
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,348
he accessed these front-end systems or a

889
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,118
particular front-end system that's fine

890
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:42,649
that's what he's supposed to do but one

891
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,750
of these sessions he's accessing a

892
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,940
system that he doesn't normally access

893
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:53,929
it's a billing system so there's a red

894
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:56,540
flag we can look at time when did he

895
00:34:53,929 --> 00:35:00,109
login he's got a very specific pattern

896
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:05,869
of time he logs in between you know 2:30

897
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:08,569
p.m. and call it 9:00 p.m. sometimes

898
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:10,160
10:00 or 11:00 but then there's a few

899
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,290
times in the wee hours of the morning

900
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,000
that he's logging in and we see some of

901
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:19,580
those as well and if you're reading logs

902
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,650
if you're looking at any one of these

903
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,720
data points nothing might flag to you

904
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,430
but at this point you've put enough

905
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,310
together to say you know what there's a

906
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,868
lot of fishy things that are here and

907
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,480
what was required was taking all that

908
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,430
data correlating it together looking at

909
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,330
those patterns and calling them out

910
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,330
right

911
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:43,220
um so what do we know from this well the

912
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,770
data you know I showed you like one day

913
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:49,189
a couple sessions well as it turns out

914
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:51,140
as we study this data uh a user's

915
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,970
patterns across all those data points

916
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,600
create almost like a fingerprint for

917
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:58,879
that user so you know the way one person

918
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,210
logs in and interacts and the commands

919
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,310
that they run isn't gonna look like a

920
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,080
second person or a third person what

921
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,210
that means is if you do see the first

922
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,220
person looking like the second person

923
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,110
the third person

924
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,689
it's probably the same person using

925
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:17,080
multiple accounts that makes sense you

926
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,610
can use this as a fingerprint to say um

927
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,770
look we think Bob's been doing some

928
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:24,050
shady things and we could take his

929
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:27,020
fingerprint though and we see Joe has

930
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:30,110
the same fingerprint so was that tell

931
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,420
you well either Bob's a bad guy and he's

932
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,400
grabbed Joe's credentials or somebody

933
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,030
has figured out how to access both Bob

934
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,800
and Joe's credentials right so you know

935
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:45,020
there's a problem and and we can see a

936
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,510
little sliver in Carol's account to that

937
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,580
or no now they've they found out who

938
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,860
Carol is and they're attempting to

939
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,049
figure out what she's got access to so

940
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,210
we see some of those same patterns right

941
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,950
in this fingerprinting method which if

942
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,020
you look at any one of these data points

943
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,910
individually it's not that telling it's

944
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,550
not like enough to spin up a whole

945
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,350
response on but when you look at them

946
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,940
across all these data points and we

947
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,830
touched on a few but there's a lot more

948
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,680
data points that you have access to with

949
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:14,630
this you can see these patterns you can

950
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,460
start to build some trust so what do you

951
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,540
do about this well you see this and

952
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,430
immediately you might say alright

953
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,620
everybody like go reset your password

954
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,419
and then it would be interesting to see

955
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,490
what happens to Bob does his behavior

956
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,040
stay the same or does it go back to like

957
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,950
a green state right now you know if

958
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,650
Bob's bad guy or if somebody else just

959
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,839
accessed his account you might start

960
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,760
some active monitoring trigger alerts

961
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,070
for some of these fingerprints coming up

962
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,300
and maybe like hey this is a really good

963
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,340
time to get some two-factor

964
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,110
authentication and because we see

965
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,540
somebody's in this environment they're

966
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,740
interested in being in this environment

967
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,240
we better make sure that the right

968
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,109
people are authenticating themselves

969
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,109
before they get access

970
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:03,050
so we did this we this was a real site

971
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,420
where we did this data analysis and the

972
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:08,450
conclusion of this was we actually found

973
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:12,260
out that there was a rogue employee a

974
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,270
contractor in I think an Indian like

975
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,570
based in India in an india-based

976
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:20,570
out sourced portion of this company that

977
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,950
was doing some bad things I don't really

978
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,660
know the details they wouldn't share her

979
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,549
what the detail not surprisingly they

980
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,810
wouldn't share exactly what he was doing

981
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,740
but they got rid of the employee and and

982
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,600
you know they found something that they

983
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,220
wouldn't found before and you can see it

984
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,500
right there in the data so a really

985
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,899
interesting example of like how this

986
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,620
information can can identify somebody

987
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:49,550
who's who's doing something bad in a

988
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:50,750
real-world scenario all right so so we

989
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,210
kind of go through that so what does all

990
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,540
that mean going back to privileged

991
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,910
access management well that foundation

992
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,710
of data and the things you can do with

993
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,000
it the analysis you can do on it the

994
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,010
controls you can build around it

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,520
actually lets you address all these

996
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:10,370
requirements so first of all you can

997
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,110
make sure that everything gets tracked

998
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,060
back to an individual person you do that

999
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,740
with a combination of like a two-factor

1000
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,200
authentication every time somebody logs

1001
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:20,990
in but now when they do you can actually

1002
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,980
confirm that any action that's happening

1003
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:27,140
you know who did it so you can do that

1004
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,060
you can put access control around those

1005
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,980
individual commands right you can

1006
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:35,029
intercept a command and block it from

1007
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:37,550
happening if it's if it's bad if it like

1008
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:43,670
we talked to we have a customer who's

1009
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:44,710
making sure that if somebody logs in so

1010
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,810
right

1011
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:50,390
somebody logs into production during

1012
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,549
normal working hours that's fine if they

1013
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,990
log in to production outside of normal

1014
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,910
working hours they need tab two-factor

1015
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,850
authentication right so you can start to

1016
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:02,299
put these really interesting rules in to

1017
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:04,130
fit your business logic um you can alert

1018
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,360
like everything that we just walked

1019
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,190
through was detecting

1020
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,630
something that was wrong and being able

1021
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,160
to learn on it and then being able to

1022
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,650
identify the problem go back and fix it

1023
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,170
and this technique is DevOps friendly

1024
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,880
you don't have to take your developers

1025
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,920
outside of their comfort zone they can

1026
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,290
they can continue to use the tools that

1027
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,920
they want to use which means it's easy

1028
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:26,360
for them so so it meets those

1029
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,440
requirements which is which is good

1030
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,500
that's what we were after

1031
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,750
um and ultimately it leads to a few good

1032
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,180
benefits that kind of really matter in

1033
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,950
the way IT security does their job you

1034
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,440
do you get better change tracking so

1035
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:42,710
there's no identity identity gaps you

1036
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,230
know hello folks I'm gig here

1037
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,270
unfortunately had an audio glitch so we

1038
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:51,670
have no more audio to the rest of this

1039
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,670
presentation sorry for the inconvenience

1040
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,700
you
