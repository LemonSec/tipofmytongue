1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,000
all right hi

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,880
everybody and welcome uh back um we're

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,639
gonna get started this is the

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,840
blue track uh for today uh we're gonna

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,519
get started with our first speaker in

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,840
just a minute uh let me introduce her

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
and her talk um

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,160
she's going to be speaking on a

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
socio-technical approach to cyber

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,519
security systems

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,920
um socio-technical systems can be viewed

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
as a linked structure of set

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
as i said structure of set of entities

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
which provide and spread information

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
through a linked structure

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
a set of linked web pages social network

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
of acquaintance or other connections

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
between individuals or common samples

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
uh in this talk she will discuss how

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,680
considering both technical and social

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
components of a complex system can help

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,879
improve the pro

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
proactive cyber threat intelligence

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
applications to protect privacy of

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,160
internet users

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
first you will talk about the history of

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
social sociotechnical systems

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
and then the recent work on their

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
evaluation then she will discuss the

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
wide range of applications where

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
considering a socio-technical approach

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:05,920
can improve

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
the security of a complex system so

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
welcome our first speaker

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
my madison and if i butchered your name

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,240

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,400
everyone

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,920
thank you again for introducing me

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:41,840
yes let me share my screen

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,320
okay

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
good uh thank you everyone and uh good

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,200
morning

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
thanks for having me today at uh besides

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,680
conference

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,320
and uh my name is matthias levi my one

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,719
as

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,960
introduced correctly and i'm an

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,239
assistant professor

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
of computer science at ccsu

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
i would like to talk about a

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,599
socio-technical

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
approach to cyber security systems as

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
the outline first we have a short

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,239
description

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,360
on sociotechnical systems and

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
dark web as an example of social

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
technical systems

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
then we review the research conducted on

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,280
dark web

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,160
and we have two studies information

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
ecosystem analysis

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,560
and information leakage assessment to

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,879
see

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,000
how uh changing our view and

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
considering dark web as a

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,000
socio-technical system helps us

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
gain a more holistic view about this

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
network

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
uh socio-technical systems are viewed as

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:56,879
a link

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,680
structure of a set of entities which

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
provide and spread information

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
to the network and

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
dark web facebook as a social

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,080
network and even the communication

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
network between

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
employees in an organization are some

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
examples of

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,599
such systems both

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
structure and information are two

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
critical aspects of

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,920
any socio-technical systems and because

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,480
they have

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,519
interaction with each other we need to

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,959
consider both of them

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,360
together when we want to evaluate a

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
socio-technical system

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,799
for example in facebook as we see

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,000
the predefined social structure that

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,200
defined in a network has direct

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
influence on

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
the information and the amount of value

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,239
each user can gain by participating in

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,360
the network

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,080
on the other hand we have the type of

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
information shared by each user

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,400
that has a direct impact on the social

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
network the user can gain

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,480
and connect with other users

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
uh let's uh begin with the definition of

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,798
dark web

105
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,478
as we know the world wide web has three

106
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,600
categories of

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
uh surface web deep web and dark web

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,919
surface web is a the regular part of the

109
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,160
internet that we daily use

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
and navigate websites using search

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,520
engines

112
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
the other part deep web contains the

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
information that cannot be indexed by

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,400
search engines and this data can be the

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
private organizational data

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,639
academic research in an institute or

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
the private records of patients in a

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
hospital

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,360
a subset of dark web is called defeb is

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
called dark

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
web that requires a unique application

122
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,080
layer protocols and

123
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,758
authorization skins to access

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
generally speaking

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,080
we have tor as the most popular

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,479
dark web in our society and as we see

127
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,440
the network contains over 6 000

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,800
volunteer relays

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
or routers that connect

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
to each other and provide anonymity for

131
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
tor users there is also a set of tour

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
authorities

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
that regularly monitor and authorize

134
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
relays if they are active and publish

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,479
the list of the authorized relays

136
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
through the network

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
to start the communication with the

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,639
server the client first needs to

139
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
incrementally establishes a path

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,440
of at least three relays

141
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
to encrypt data and uh send it to the

142
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
server

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
here all the communications uh utilize

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,759
tcp

145
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,080
and the first relay in the path is

146
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
called entry or guard and the last one

147
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,039
is

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
exit tor hidden service

149
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
also is a feature that added to the tour

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,919
network

151
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,639
to provide anonymity for service

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,520
providers

153
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,240
the users who want to publish and

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,800
provide

155
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
services on the internet and a computer

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,199
that

157
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
is used to spread information

158
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
on tor network is called a domain and

159
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
the information provided by a domain is

160
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,240
called a hidden service

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
and the addresses in tor network have a

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
suffix dot onion that indicates

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,919
the address belongs to tor network

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,280
and the rest of the address contains

165
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,120
16 digits or letters

166
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
that are meaningless i mean

167
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,199
is not a real name as we see for the

168
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,759
other

169
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,400
addresses on surface

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
as uh the related research on dark web

171
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
indicates

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
the original purpose of designing dark

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,520
web

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,160
was to circumvent internet censorship

175
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,840
around the world

176
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
and it's a good tools to release

177
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
information to public

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,319
and uh buying and selling goods and

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
services through the marketplaces

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
and these novel users make tour an

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
important sociotechnical

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,280
system in our today life

183
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,639
you may also heard about the negative

184
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
or dark side of uh tor network

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
good tools for drug dealing human

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
trafficking terrorism activities or

187
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
the other negative applications of this

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
network

189
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
reviewing the related work on tor

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
network

191
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,720
we can categorize these studies into

192
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
two groups tor structure

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
characterization which is at the

194
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,120
beginning

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
to be studied and tour information

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
characterization

197
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,960
the first group of research

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,919
concentrates on some features like

199
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,800
sparsity

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
mirroring and redundancy of tour domains

201
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,960
considering the hyperlink

202
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,840
structure of tour domains to see whether

203
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,240
they

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
follow bowtie structure robustness and

205
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
fragility against

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
node removal and how long

207
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,160
these two domains and their hyperlinks

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
can

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,880
exceed on the network

210
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,599
the second category characterizes the

211
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,559
information

212
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,839
hosted on tour dominance crawler extract

213
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,159
and analyzed topics like

214
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
drugs and human trafficking and suicide

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,360
methods therefore

216
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
the current evaluation of tor

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
concentrates

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
narrowly and exclusively on either

219
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,560
structure

220
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
or information while

221
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,959
if we consider dark web as a social

222
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,640
technical system

223
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
we require to study the interaction

224
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,320
between

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
structure and information so uh to fill

226
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
uh this gap in the current related work

227
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
on dark web

228
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
we want to see how by studying dark web

229
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
as a socio-technical system

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,320
we can gain a more holistic view of this

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
network in our first study

232
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
information ecosystem analysis

233
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
we perform a comprehensive crawler on

234
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
tor network

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,959
and through topic modeling and network

236
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,399
analysis

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
try to answer such

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
research questions how diverse is the

239
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
information and services

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
provided on tour we like to see

241
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
what is the main application of

242
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,000
information

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
and services provided on this network

244
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,079
and whether there is any

245
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
core service onto our network

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,360
structurally

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
core uh service that we may have

248
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,320
onto our network also uh how siloed are

249
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,880
the tour

250
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
information sources uh answering to

251
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,800
these questions

252
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,160
can help us find the main application

253
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
of services onto our network and

254
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
understand more about the hyperlink

255
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,240
structure of tour domains

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
to do so first we need to collect our

257
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,959
data

258
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,279
and pre-process it to start our analysis

259
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,399
uh we found 20 000

260
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
seats initial seats from some resources

261
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,880
on surface web

262
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,920
some from dark web and some

263
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,320
from related work and we fed them into

264
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
four uh power crawlers running for two

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,480
months

266
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
and crawlering up to the dev 4.

267
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
we focused only on html files to

268
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,240
avoid uh request limiters and

269
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
crawlering plugs and we found over 1

270
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,240
million

271
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,600
html files to segregate

272
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
the files belonging to dark web we did a

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
type filtering based on the suffix of

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,880
addresses that resulted in over 150

275
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
pages because the vast majority of

276
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,000
content provided on tor is in english

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
over 80 percent we did a language

278
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,440
detection

279
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
to segregate the english content

280
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
and we found over 40 000 english pages

281
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
that belong to

282
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,399
uh 1766 uh dummies in tor

283
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
and finally to assign a semantically

284
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,959
meaningful

285
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
label as a topic for each domain

286
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,279
we did topic modeling and graphics topic

287
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:01,920
labeling

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,399
based on dbpedia to find the topics of

289
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,920
each domain based on the text content of

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,519
their pages

291
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
here you see our results 9

292
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
unique topics directory

293
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,040
indicates services with huge list of

onion addresses

295
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
uh up-to-date uh information about tor

296
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
services

297
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,440
bitcoin uh belongs to services for

298
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
digital cryptocurrency and transferring

299
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,680
money to wallets

300
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,200
uh we also have news uh very similar to

301
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
personal web likes on surface web where

302
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,079
owner provides some opinions

303
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,680
about different topics and readers can

304
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
put follow-up comments email

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,519
through the network and purchasing vpns

307
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
we also have multimedia services

308
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,360
different

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
resources like videos ebooks musics

310

without any copyright restriction

311
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
shopping indicates marketplaces on tour

312
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
forum indicates services very similar to

313
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
the forums we have on surface web

314
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,200
gambling belongs to services

315
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,399
to do online games gambling

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,160
purchasing consultancy or advice on

317
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,839
gambling and finally we have dream

318
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,800
market

319
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,399
a very popular marketplace on tour

320
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
with different items from

321
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,560
laptops to directly link

322
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
and as we see here it's have its own

323
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
topic analysis on the population of

324
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,160
these

325
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,519
uh topics indicate that directory dream

326
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,000
market

327
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
and shopping have the largest population

328
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
that are used to release information

329
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,079
to public through the directory services

330
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,040
and

331
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,399
shopping on tour network and it may

332
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,320
indicate the main application

333
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
of english domains on tour the second

334
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,240
category

335
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
belongs to email forum and news that are

336
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
used to

337
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,959
free exchange for free exchange of ideas

338
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
and we also found 10 percent of

339
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,920
these population the english domains

340
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,959
are for gambling services that is kind

341
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
of surprising

342
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,959
because it suggests that people today

343
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,760
use tor to do online games as an

344
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
entertainment tools

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,760
we also found another surprising

346
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
results here we see the small population

347
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,839
of bitcoin

348
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,480
it was in contrast to our initial

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,600
expectation

350
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
because we expected to see bitcoin as

351
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,519
more popular with regard to the large

352
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,480
population of

353
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
marketplaces on tour where uh users

354
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
generally use bitcoin as a method of

355
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,240
payment

356
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
and this result may indicate that uh tor

357
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
users do not trust

358
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,880
um dark bitcoin services on tour

359
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
also to understand more about the

360
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,800
hyperlink structure of tor domains

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,839
we considered each domain as a node and

362
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
a hyperlink

363
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,680
between domains as connected edges

364
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,720
and we found this network as

365
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
we see in the table this network is a

366
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
sparse

367
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,320
only over 5500

368
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,800
edges for over

369
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,959
1700 notes and

370
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
very low density value close to zero

371
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,160
we also find 25 weekly connected

372
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,959
components

373
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,040
where the largest component contains

374
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
almost 50 percent of notes

375
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,240
and this is in contrast to what we have

376
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
in other socio-technical systems like

377
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,560
the surface web where almost all nodes

378
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,320
participate in one massive connected

379
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
component and this suggests that the

380
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,959
hyperlink structure

381
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
of tor domains discourage

382
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,759
linking to each other which helps them

383
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,040
remain isolated and difficult to

384
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,519
observe

385
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
we also uh consider the intra

386
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
connectivity analysis of tour domains to

387
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,399
see

388
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,279
if they support each other if they

389
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,560
prefer to

390
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
link and refer their own customer to

391
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,680
other domains with similar service types

392
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
as we see here during market domains are

393
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,319
tightly connected only

394
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,799
four to five strangly connected

395
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,079
components

396
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,240
also we have shopping gambling

397
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,199
multimedia

398
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,439
news and bitcoin more isolated nodes

399
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,119
and they are disconnected which reflects

400
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,039
the competition between these service

401
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,400
owners because they do not like to refer

402
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
their customers to other domains with

403
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
similar service type

404
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
on the other hand we have a directory

405
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,960
forum

406
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
and email all exhibits a single large

407
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,600
connected component with fewer number of

408
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,440
isolated nodes

409
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,320
and this indicates some levels of

410
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
support or cooperation

411
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,039
between these service owners

412
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
we also computed modularity to see if

413
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,039
there is any

414
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,799
relation between interconnectivity and

415
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,039
interconnectivity

416
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,400
of domains or domains

417
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,559
and based on the definition of

418
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,880
modularity a domain will have

419
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,720
a high modularity if it tends to

420
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
link to other domains with similar

421
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
service type

422
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,960
and has a fewer number of links to other

423
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
pages

424
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
with different service type here we see

425
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,120
uh during market has the maximum value

426
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
which uh indicates dream market domains

427
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
are largely siloed from all the other

428
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,320
domains

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,440
they have more link to each other and

430
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
a few links to other domains with

431
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
different service type also

432
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
the low value of modularity for other

433
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
services

434
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,679
indicate that the majority of tour

435
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,240
domains strongly prefer to

436
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
link to other types of services

437
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,640
we also did an importance evaluation

438
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
based on some network metrics on the

439
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
hyperlink structure of tour domains

440
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,520
to see if we can find uh the interaction

441
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,320
between information and structure on

442
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
tool

443
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,720
as we see here we have the cdf of

444
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
betweenness centrality and this

445
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
centrality indicates

446
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,039
the number of shortest path that a node

447
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,480
participates in

448
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
and it helps us detect the amount of

449
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,640
influence and node

450
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
can have over the flow of information in

451
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
our graph

452
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
the result indicates that betweenness

453
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,360
centrality for

454
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
the majority is close to zero and for a

455
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
few of them

456
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,240
it has values greater than 0.05

457
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
our manual investigation over such

458
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
domains

459
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,280
indicate that they belong to well-known

460
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
tour directories

461
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,559
so any attack removal or

462
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,080
failure of such directories may directly

463
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,200
impact the number of tor domains

464
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,440
that can be reachable by a casual

465
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,480
browsing

466
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,679
and this also indicates the important

467
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,679
role of

468
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,520
tor directories as entry points for

469
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,400
our crawlers

470
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,679
we also have eigenvector analysis

471
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
eigenvector describes the importance of

472
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,720
each

473
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,360
node in a graph as a function of the

474
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,039
importance of its

475
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,159
neighbors again we see

476
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
in the density plots of eigenvector

477
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,000
centrality

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
the majority have values

479
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
near zero and for a few domains

480
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,200
eigenvector centrality is greater than

481
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,919
point

482
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,480
two again our manual investigation over

483
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,679
these domains

484
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,080
indicate that they belong to doing

485
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,200
market domains

486
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,320
during market services and because the

487
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
organization of tor

488
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,880
is naturally developed the high

489
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
eigenvector centrality of dream markets

490
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
places them as the most meaningful

491
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,039
structurally meaningful uh core service

492
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,320
on tour so uh if we design uh

493
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,039
search engines that work based on uh

494
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,240
eigenvector

495
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
centrality like page rank

496
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,120
our search engine will rank

497
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,200
any page that has a link to dream market

498
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,200
as the top in the result of our search

499
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,840
as a summary of finding for the first

500
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,880
research

501
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
we identified over half of all english

502
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,159
domains belonging to directory and

503
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
marketplaces

504
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,760
releasing information to public and

505
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,400
shopping

506
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,600
on tour we also found surprisingly large

507
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,760
percentage of gambling domains

508
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,280
that suggest people use tor to do

509
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,159
online games we also identified dream

510
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,799
market

511
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,000
as a core service structurally important

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
core service on score and the patterns

513
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,360
in

514
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,640
intra-connectivity structure indicates

515
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
some levels of cooperation and

516
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,000
competition between

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
service owners on tour

518
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
okay with regard to the tendency of

519
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,960
tor domains to be isolated we

520
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
did another study on information

521
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,039
decage assessment to see

522
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,320
to what extent tour hidden services

523
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
may have the potential of information

524
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
leakage

525
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
because of linking to surface web here

526
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
we want to see

527
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
how many of tor dominance may have

528
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,600
linked

529
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
to the surface web which make them

530
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,840
vulnerable against

531
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,240
information leakage an answer to this

532
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,880
question

533
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
can help us improve the design of pages

534
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,039
on tour

535
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,000
in a way that we can reduce the

536
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,720
potential

537
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
information leakage from the perspective

538
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,760
of service owners designing the page

539
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,840
with fewer potential for information

540
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,039
leakage

541
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,440
helps customers to trust in our services

542
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
so uh first begin with the definition of

543
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
information leakage as we know there are

544
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,559
two ways to connect to our network

545
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
directly using tor browser that is

546
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,720
suggested by the main project and

547
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
indirectly

548
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,799
using tor proxies like torture and it's

549
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,200
not

550
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
recommended by a tor

551
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,159
project in the second way

552
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
uh proxy plays as the middleman between

553
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,159
tor client

554
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,000
and dark web and when the client

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,440
requests a page from dark web proxy

556
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
finds the page on dark web retrieves it

557
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
from dark web and rewrites the content

558
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
and delivers it to the tor client but

559
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,880
here if the requested page contains any

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,320
link to the surface web these

561
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,320
links will not rewritten by the proxy

562
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,080
so the browser that is used by tor

563
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,200
client

564
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,400
can uh see the identity of

565
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,840
tor client so this uh is the general

566
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
procedure that happens for the

567
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
information leakage problem

568
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,559
and this problem happens because the

569
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
user doesn't follow

570
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,760
the recommended way to connect to the

571
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,240
tor

572
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,080
network we again

573
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,279
crawlered pages on dark web

574
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,880
and this time we collected

575
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
and kept both pages from surface

576
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
web and dark web because we want to

577
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
see how many of dark domains have linked

578
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,799
to the surface web

579
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,960
we found near 2 million distinct pages

580
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
over 3500 from surface web

581
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
and 3200 from dark atomics

582
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,918
to see

583
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
to what extent tour domains have the

584
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,080
potential

585
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,039
of information leakage due to linking to

586
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,559
the surface web

587
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,840
we considered a number of neighbors each

588
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,039
tour domain

589
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,320
has from both surface web and dark

590
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,120
domains

591
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,159
as we see here a plot

592
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
in logarithmic scale indicates number of

593
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,640
surface web neighbors

594
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,279
versus the number of dark web neighbors

595
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,200
for each tour dummy

596
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,240
we found three different areas

597
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
in this plot the first area

598
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,799
that is the blue one belongs to services

599
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,000
with less than

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
three surface neighbors that form

601
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,320
13 percent of dark services where eight

602
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,600
percent have only

603
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,799
links to tour dummies so

604
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,240
this indicates only less than 0.1

605
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
percent

606
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,080
of dark services have immunity against

607
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
the information leakage

608
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,320
because they do not have any link to the

609
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
surface

610
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,880
the second area the green one indicates

611
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
services with less than three dark

612
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
neighbors

613
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
and this area forms 20 percent of dark

614
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,480
services

615
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
where 14 percent have only links to the

616
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
surface

617
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
so less than 0.2 percent of dark

618
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:00,960
services

619
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,960
have only links to the surface websites

620
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,440
the rest belongs to 78 percent of all

621
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,919
points

622
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,120
in our plot dark services that contain

623
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,559
hyperlinks to both

624
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,720
surface and dark web and this population

625
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
in addition to the size of second

626
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,960
category that indicated

627
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,679
number of tour domains with linked to

628
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,039
the surface web

629
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,080
implies that more than 90 percent of

630
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,360
tour domains

631
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
contain at least one link to the surface

632
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,559
web

633
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,720
so they have the potential of

634
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,840
information

635
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,919
leakage problem we also

636
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
analyze the reference view of tor

637
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
services

638
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
to see whether linking to the surface

639
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,039
can

640
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,640
change the hyperlink structure of tor

641
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,080
dummies i also refer you to

642
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,200
our main paper for the other

643
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,399
network metrics but today i just want to

644
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,200
talk about

645
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
edge betweenness centrality and stress

646
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,200
centrality

647
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
as we know edge betweenness centrality

648
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,559
of an edge

649
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,760
indicates to what extent

650
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,480
the age plays a role in bridging

651
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,360
communication

652
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,399
between network notes

653
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,000
so again we plotted

654
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
the city ccdf of edge between the

655
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,480
centralities

656
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,760
and we found a few domains with very

657
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,039
large betweenness centrality more than

658
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,080
ten thousand manual investigation on

659
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,399
such domains indicate that

660
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,600
these ages belong to

661
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,720
connect toward directories to each other

662
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,000
so removal or failure of

663
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,200
these directories may affect the

664
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
communication

665
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
between several pairs of domains on the

666
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,000
tor

667
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
network

668
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,919
also as stress centrality of a node

669
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:04,640
indicates

670
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
number of shortest paths running to the

671
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,520
node in a network

672
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,120
we want to see which domains in the tour

673
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
have high value of stress that

674
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,200
indicates the node plays an important

675
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
role in information dissemination

676
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,919
through the network

677
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
again a ccdf plot of stress centrality

678
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
indicates that only six percent of

679
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
our data have a stress centrality

680
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
greater than the average

681
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
so large portion of tour services

682
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
are reluctant to contribute to

683
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
information dissemination

684
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
which helps them remain difficult to

685
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,480
discover

686
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
remain isolated we also investigated

687
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
domains with high stress and found that

688
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,880
more than half of them belong to

689
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,159
well-known directories on tour

690
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
so as a result of our finding

691
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,200
90 percent of tour domains have at least

692
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,039
one link to the surface web

693
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,380
and have the vulnerability against

694
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,640
[Music]

695
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,159
information leakage and we found that

696
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,080
well-known tour directories

697
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
significantly contribute to

698
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,799
communication and information

699
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,240
dissemination

700
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,399
in the network of dark to surface

701
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,159
graph so

702
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,000
as a quick conclusion on our talk

703
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
we identified how we can change

704
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,399
our view to the dark web and by

705
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,279
considering

706
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,399
dark web as a socio-technical system

707
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
we can find uh more

708
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
about the interaction between a

709
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,799
structure and information

710
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,919
on tor which helps us gain a more

711
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,600
holistic view onto our network

712
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,960
as the direction for a future work

713
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,320
we like to study more novel analytics to

714
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,039
evaluate

715
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
tour ecosystem and compare its

716
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,000
hyperlink structure with other

717
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,440
socio-technical systems

718
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,039
whether we can model this underlying

719
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:21,919
hyperlink

720
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,519
network using other network models

721
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,519
like ergon and also

722
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,760
we will consider the modest operandi of

723
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,480
services

724
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,240
in non-english languages to see how

725
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,080
people around the world use tor network

726
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,320
okay uh thank you very much for your

727
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,840
attention and

728
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
please let me know if you have any

729
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,600
questions or contact me

730
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,600
for more details about our studies

731
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,840
thank you

732
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,840
okay please let me know if you have any

733
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
questions

734
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,840
uh yes there is a question uh for me how

735
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
does dark web based

736
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,760
uh okay impact your

737
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
thank you thank you for your question

738
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,679
yes uh we found also

739
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,279
capture coding for some pages on dark

740
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:51,919
web

741
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,960
particularly uh dream market pages

742
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,399
use this coding to make sure

743
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,919
who connects and use their web pages

744
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,720
our crawler ignored the pages with

745
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,840
capture codes

746
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,120
but there is also a direction

747
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,360
to improve our clearing techniques to

748
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,440
collect data from dark

749
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:25,840
yes thank you for your question

750
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
