uh our first talk for the red track

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,480
today

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,040
is by chris anti i think you guys are

7

uh he's going to talk about

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
cryptocurrency blockchain

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
ransomware and at the end of his talk

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,600

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,160
you

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
and make it all sense and you'll uh see

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
where um everything just

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
meets up on these uh three different

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
technologies

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
so let me bring chris in now

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
[Music]

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
can you guys see me and hear me i can

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,920

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,399
thanks awesome all right take it away

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
okay well big thanks to the b-sides

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,480
connecticut team

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
for uh giving me the opportunity to

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
speak i think

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
um a positive of having these virtual

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
conferences especially during

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,800
the global pandemic is that i guess

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
people from

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,039
other geographically located areas are

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,239
able to participate

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,640
in conferences like this so i i'm not

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
part of the

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
i guess i'm not located near the

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
connecticut uh new england area so

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,360
i think it's really cool that i have

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
this opportunity so thank you for that

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
let me share my screen

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,200
okay

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:41,840
give me one second guys

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
okay so what i'm going to be talking

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,240
about today is

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
cryptocurrency and the evolving threat

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,360
of ransomware

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
um thank you guys again for joining

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
pretty early on a saturday

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
but this i think this topic is is pretty

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
interesting so hopefully it'll

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
keep you guys awake and um involved and

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,280
just

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
interested in general so uh i guess just

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,880
as a

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
general disclaimer

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
the stuff i'll talk about in this

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,239
presentation

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
was research and done in my own

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,520
individual

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
accord and on my own time

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,160
it's not representative of miter's views

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
on the technologies or some of the

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
um different concepts that i'm talking

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
about here so just wanted to

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
lay that out there um so

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
quick intro about myself so i work

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
for the mitre corporation as a cyber

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,480
security engineer

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
if you're not familiar with mitre we are

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
not for profit that

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
works in the public interest so that

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
means working with the federal

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
government working with state and local

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,519
governments

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
by also putting out public solutions for

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
the general community to use whether it

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
be in info securi

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
or information security healthcare

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,000
aerospace

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
we cover a bunch of different technology

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
domains

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,239
but my focus at mitre is working on

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
cyber threat intelligence

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
and some of you might be familiar with

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
the attack framework and i believe there

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
was also

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
a workshop on this yesterday if you guys

86
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
had the chance to

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
attend it unfortunately i wasn't but uh

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,920
if you're not familiar

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
attack stands for the adversarial

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
tactics techniques

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
and common knowledge framework uh and

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
it's basically a knowledge base

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
of adversarial tactics and techniques

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,120
that have been used

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
in the wild by legitimate threat actors

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,440
whether it be from nation states

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
or cyber criminals and really just

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
building upon

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
threat intelligence gathered from

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
reporting and

101
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,879
incorporating that into your own

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
security posture whether it be through

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
red teaming

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
security operations defensive operations

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
there's a bunch of different use cases

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
and i could talk about attack for a

107
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,680
while but

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
that's a little bit about my current

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
position so some of my interests

110
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,959
uh like i mentioned cyber threat

111
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,360
intelligence uh adversarial emulation

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
so that's combining red teaming plus uh

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,959
threat intelligence

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
um from legitimate reporting

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,720
and adversaries uh techniques and

116
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
combining that all together

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
industrial control systems and the

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
internet of things blockchain

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
hence why i'm talking about this

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
specific topic cloud

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
some of my previous roles include

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
working as a technology consultant at

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,840
ibm where i had worked with a lot of

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,440
these new emerging technologies that's

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,240
actually how

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,479
i kind of got my start in blockchain

127
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,520
cloud

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,560
devsecops and i think just the evolving

129
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
nature of

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
technology and how it i guess it manages

131
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,960
to

132
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
change and vastly

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
become vastly different on a yearly

134
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,400
basis is really exciting and i think

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
this is definitely the

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
field to be in so before ibm or before

137
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
my position ibm i worked as the

138
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
program director of cyber security for

139
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,199
the national student leadership

140
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,000
conference

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
uh this was a leadership conference for

142
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
high school students where i would

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
uh teach both technical cyber skills as

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,199
well as

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
leadership skills for them to get

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
excited about you know becoming eventual

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,639
leaders in the field if this is

148
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,199
something

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
that they did want to pursue down the

150
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
line

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
um so i'm also pursuing a masters in

152
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
applied intelligence just to

153
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
supplement and build upon my just

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
overall interest and passion

155
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
around cyber threat intelligence and

156
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
understanding adversary intent

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,360
uh the cultural context behind why

158
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
certain

159
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,759
cyber criminals nation states

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
hacktivists uh go about the

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
i guess the actions that they

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
participate in

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
um so i am also pursuing that

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
uh in my free time i love to play piano

165
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,639
if you

166
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,120
you can see a picture here uh i guess my

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,759
collection

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
and it shows a a variety of different

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,479
fandoms or uh different media forms i'm

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,280
a fan of

171
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
so baby yoda pikachu so on so forth

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
uh the the picture on the left is a

173
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
picture of me attempting to birdwatch

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
unfortunately i don't think in this

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
specific picture that i was

176
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
able to see any actual birds but it's

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
something i've also picked up during

178
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
quarantine uh which is a pretty nice you

179
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
know social distancing

180
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
activity it's really relaxing to just

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,400
kind of get out there and

182
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
enjoy the simple things in life um like

183
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
birds

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,039
and then i will tell this to everyone

185
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
normally as my my first icebreaker

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
but i'm heavily anti-pineapple on pizza

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
feel free to discuss that with me after

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,199
this presentation and discord or

189
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
shoot me a tweet i'll share my contact

190
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
info

191
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,400
but we can have a discussion about that

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,440
just know that i'm

193
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,960
big anti-pineapple on pizza

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
so i don't have an outline slide but i

195
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
guess i'll talk about

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,599
what um i guess the general topics that

197
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,280
will be covered in this presentation so

198
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,080
first off i'll

199
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,479
start talking about uh the general

200
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,160
technology behind blockchain

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,479
how it operates some attacks on the

202
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,520
blockchain

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
the history of ransomware dating back to

204
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,759
the early 90s

205
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
and making its way to the present day

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,599
and how some of the

207
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
techniques of deploying ransomware and

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,080
just the way ransomware operates

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
has evolved throughout the past two

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,759
decades or so

211
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
um and then comparing different

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin

213
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
and monero which is a privacy coin um

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
it's a cryptocurrency that is focused

215
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
and has security and privacy built into

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,960
it

217
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
um and i'll explain the differences

218
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,400
between those and then

219
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
uh towards the end i'll try to bring it

220
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,520
all together and you know

221
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,080
relate it back to our current situation

222
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,639
and

223
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,639
stuff you should be i guess just

224
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,280
generally weary about

225
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
so another quick disclaimer uh this

226
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
presentation is not going to be me

227
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,599
pitching any specific cryptocurrency i'm

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,039
solely going to be talking about

229
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,960
uh the technologies and how

230
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
cryptocurrencies

231
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
are used by malicious actors from pretty

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,080
high level i won't

233
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
dive too deep into any one any

234
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,160
one specific topic but hopefully you'll

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,639
you know

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
carry out from this conversation and

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
this presentation

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
um and be able to give a quick elevator

239
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,160
pitch to

240
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
to someone if they were to ask you uh

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
can you give me um

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,199
a quick primer on what blockchain is

243
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
like i always hear about it on the news

244
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,199
or um how do i invest in cryptocurrency

245
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,080
you won't learn how to

246
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
invest in cryptocurrency but you'll have

247
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
a better understanding of

248
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,759
what it is why it's important and why

249
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,919
just the general world is starting to

250
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,919
you know really keep their eyes on it

251
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,958
it's been

252
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
pretty popular i'd say for the past five

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,159
years or so

254
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
um but it's continuing to grow in

255
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,599
popularity and

256
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,040
you know the technology has a lot of

257
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,760
implications and uh useful use cases

258
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,320
that

259
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
if used correctly um can definitely be

260
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
beneficial to

261
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
society in general so quick disclaimer

262
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,720
there uh no stunks

263
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
so what is blockchain and a really

264
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,000
simple way to

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
think of it is that it's essentially a

266
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,440
digital record

267
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
or a ledger so a ledger is the term that

268
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,760
the blockchain security community likes

269
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,320
to use

270
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
but it's essentially a digital record of

271
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
transactions

272
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
uh just a large uh yeah i'm hesitant to

273
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,600
call it a database

274
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
but it's essentially a record of all

275
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
these different transactions and

276
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
i guess what differentiates itself from

277
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
a traditional database

278
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
are these key characteristics here so

279
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
the first one is immutability

280
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
so every time a transaction is added to

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
a blockchain network

282
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
it can never be changed that ensures

283
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,240
integrity

284
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
and just ensures that you know people

285
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
operating on the blockchain

286
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
don't do things they're not supposed to

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
and obviously there are caveats to this

288
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
that i'll

289
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,640
cover in a little bit but generally

290
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
blockchains are

291
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,880
immutable decentralization so the idea

292
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,680
of a blockchain network is that people

293
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
operate blockchain nodes

294
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,360
um and that can just be a server that

295
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,959
they're running on their their house

296
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,839
or in their house um on a device running

297
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
a specific blockchain node

298
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,279
um and if that specific node goes down

299
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,040
uh the blockchain network will continue

300
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
to persist ensuring that there's no

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
single point of failure rather than

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
um you know a centralized database being

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
behind some

304
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
um you know bank pay system and

305
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,920
if a malicious actor takes down that

306
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,440
database um

307
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,399
then that's a huge data breach and it

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
would be very hard for

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
that specific organization to recover

310
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
because it was

311
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
centralized in one location so fault

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
tolerance is is really

313
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
uh key in just the concept of a

314
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
blockchain network and

315
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
it being distributed so anyone can host

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
a blockchain network depending on the

317
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,240
specific blockchain

318
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,720
of course but it kind of falls in with

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
the past point about

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,399
blockchain being decentralized

321
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
transparency so this is really important

322
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,880
um with most blockchains especially

323
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,839
bitcoin and

324
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
uh other popular uh cryptocurrencies

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
like litecoin ethereum you could go out

326
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,240
and

327
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,079
go on a specific website which we'll do

328
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
later on in this presentation

329
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
and look at all the historical

330
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
transactions and data that have

331
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,839
occurred on uh the blockchain network so

332
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,519
in this case for bitcoin

333
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
you can go back as far as 2009 and just

334
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
download all the historical data

335
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
and just do a quick analysis of how

336
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
transactions have changed and

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
um you know just examine the the

338
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
characteristics and

339
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,279
different transactions that have

340
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
happened throughout the years

341
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
and arguably the most important point is

342
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
that blockchain is

343
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,160
intended to be secure by using really

344
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
complex cryptographic

345
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
protocols um and again there are caveats

346
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,880
to this

347
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,120
and i think a problem that a lot of

348
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
non-technical users or really people who

349
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
don't understand blockchain is

350
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
they assume blockchain is the end-all

351
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,680
be-all solution

352
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
to a back-end or once they implement

353
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,120
quote-unquote blockchain into their

354
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
enterprise or their network or in some

355
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,360
application in some way

356
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,440
that it will solve all their problems

357
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
and they won't have to worry about that

358
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,519
but

359
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,120
obviously as security professionals we

360
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
know that's not the case

361
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
and you know honestly in my opinion

362
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
there's no

363
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
perfect system i'm not sure other people

364
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
have differing opinions but

365
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,920
you know considering the evolving

366
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
technological landscape there will never

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,320
be

368
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
a perfectly secure system because of

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,440
human error

370
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
and again the evolving technological

371
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,560
landscape

372
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
so those are the key characteristics of

373
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,079
a blockchain and here's

374
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,399
just a quick infographic of how it works

375
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,959
so a user will request a transaction

376
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,120
um that transaction is represented in a

377
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
block that block is then broadcasted to

378
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,839
the the nodes that are hosting the

379
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,680
blockchain network so all the different

380
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
servers and devices that are hosting

381
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
that specific blockchain network

382
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,279
those nodes then validate that

383
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,360
transaction and once that validation

384
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,000
happens

385
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,560
that block is added to the chain thus

386
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,639
making a blockchain and the transaction

387
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
is you know confirmed and executed

388
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,800
so hopefully all of you now know just

389
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
generally how a blockchain works and how

390
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,760
transactions are

391
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
are added um and that i guess what i

392
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,440
just talked about

393
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
is pretty much the same across all types

394
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,040
of blockchains there

395
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
there are uh nuances between uh

396
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
different

397
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
different cryptocurrencies and different

398
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
use cases but in general that's how they

399
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,639
operate

400
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
so speaking of use cases besides

401
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
cryptocurrency there there are

402
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
some pretty significant use cases that

403
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,279
are in the works right now

404
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,920
in academia and research and even

405
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,560
industry

406
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
that are trying to implement blockchain

407
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,680
so

408
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
uh what the first one is digital

409
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
identity you know being able to prove

410
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
who you are and uh making sure your

411
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
identity isn't compromised in some way

412
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
and blockchain is

413
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,079
a technology that could potentially help

414
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,120
in

415
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
bridging together that gap between

416
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,160
identification

417
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
and you know making sure not and

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
not too much personal information is

419
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,399
leaked out then than necessary

420
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
supply chain is another good use case so

421
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,440
making sure

422
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
all the parts of maybe your hardware

423
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
components or

424
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
a computer that you're trying to build

425
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,560
or any kind of hardware components

426
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,880
along the supply chain get to the place

427
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,839
that they need to

428
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
and again aren't tampered with or aren't

429
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
stolen

430
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
and you know they're not meant to

431
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
you know be tampered with in some way

432
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
and

433
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,120
yeah so that supply chain is a very

434
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
useful use case for for blockchain

435
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
right now healthit so this is similar to

436
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,560
digital

437
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
identity in a way just making sure that

438
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
both your i.t

439
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,040
health networks are secure but also

440
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,560
making sure that your personal health

441
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,519
information

442
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
is um you know it doesn't get into the

443
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
hands of

444
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,440
people that shouldn't be seeing this

445
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,399
information on a health it network

446
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,480
and then finances of course so that

447
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
brings us to cryptocurrency

448
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
and you might recognize some of the the

449
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,000
cryptocurrencies here but

450
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
um if you let me see if i can do a

451
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
can i do a laser pointer yeah i can

452
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,440
awesome

453
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,839
um so this one right here is bitcoin you

454
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,240
probably all recognize it in some

455
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
capacity you've seen it on the news or

456
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,279
just talked about

457
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,680
uh this is monero this is the logo for

458
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,279
monero the privacy coin i mentioned at

459
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,480
the beginning of the talk

460
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
this is ripple litecoin ethereum

461
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,079
and then dogecoin so you've probably

462
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
seen this uh meme dawn pretty

463
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
pretty often but these are some of the

464
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,560
most popular cryptocurrencies and

465
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,040
this infograph i believe is

466
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,480
i'm not sure if this is the one from may

467
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
or if i updated it but just real

468
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
just know that generally these are the

469
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,920
top

470
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
10 most popular cryptocurrencies you

471
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
know at all times and bitcoin and

472
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
ethereum will always

473
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
um essentially be at the top and

474
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
let's actually talk about some of the

475
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,160
differences between cryptocurrency like

476
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,880
bitcoin

477
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,639
and ethereum so with bitcoin

478
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
a thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin

479
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
is really just an

480
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
application of a blockchain network and

481
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
the purpose of bitcoin is to serve as

482
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
a digital currency platform whereas

483
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
something like ethereum

484
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,920
ethereum is built off blockchain but

485
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
ethereum itself

486
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
is an application platform it's a

487
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,880
competing platform

488
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,399
that has cryptocurrency uh functionality

489
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:32,800
so

490
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,279
ethereum's cryptocurrency is actually

491
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
called ether

492
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,959
but the ethereum platform allows for

493
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
robust applications to be built on

494
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
the ethereum blockchain and one of the

495
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
most important features of ethereum is

496
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
something called smart contracts

497
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
which allows users on the ethereum

498
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,519
network

499
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,000
to execute certain business rules for

500
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
their application

501
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
and that's a really high level way of

502
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
putting it but

503
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,959
the way it's implemented allows users to

504
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
add in additional complex features that

505
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,880
will only

506
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
execute transactions modify transactions

507
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,480
uh when a certain condition is met and

508
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,439
this is something that

509
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
isn't offered in in bitcoin so the

510
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
consensus algorithm is how a bitcoin or

511
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,000
ethereum

512
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
um is collected so you might have heard

513
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,119
of bitcoin mining

514
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,760
that essentially is trying to solve

515
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
really complex

516
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
mathematical cryptographic problems to

517
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,120
be able to

518
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,320
earn bitcoin and the point to

519
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,960
where it is now bitcoin mining is is

520
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,720
quite difficult there are

521
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,360
um there are dedicated cities in china

522
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
you might have heard of this in the news

523
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,720
but there are dedicated mining cities in

524
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,679
in china that are

525
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
running 24 7 just trying to mine bitcoin

526
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,720
but

527
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
um as it's grown throughout the years

528
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
and since its conception in

529
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
um 2009 it's become that

530
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,559
much more increasingly difficult to mine

531
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,400
bitcoin and ethereum

532
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
so ethereum right now also works on the

533
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,760
same consensus algorithm

534
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
but they're moving towards what's called

535
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,880
proof-of-stake uh

536
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,280
a proof-of-stake protocol means that the

537
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,720
more

538
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,440
i guess presence or the more the more

539
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,919
stake

540
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
for lack of a better term that you have

541
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,760
in the ethereum network the more mining

542
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
power

543
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
you'll have so what does that mean that

544
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
means if you operate

545
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
uh an ethereum node that gives you that

546
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
much more ability to

547
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,400
successfully mine ethereum and this is

548
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
still incredibly difficult but it gives

549
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,000
a little incentive for

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
for community users in the community to

551
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
help contribute back to

552
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,720
um cryptocurrency and just blocked in

553
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,919
blockchain in general

554
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,640
because it is so community driven and um

555
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,120
you know

556
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,919
blockchain really is dependent on its

557
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,200
users from

558
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
all around the world and all over the

559
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,720
community and just a quick thing so

560
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million

561
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
so once 21 million bitcoin have been

562
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,120
mined there will be no more bitcoin

563
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
um whereas ethereum or i should say

564
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
ether the cryptocurrency

565
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,320
there's no fixed supply for that

566
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,679
so there are some specific

567
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
cryptocurrency attacks

568
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
and they can be bundled into about three

569
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,600
buckets i want to say there's more

570
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
categories than this but in general

571
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
these are some of the more popular and

572
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,960
documented

573
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
cryptocurrency attacks that have

574
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
happened throughout the years so

575
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
the first one is attempting to directly

576
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,440
attack

577
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,240
the blockchain network and what the

578
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,880
first

579
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
option here is called uh symbol attack

580
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
and the way this works is that it will

581
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
target the entire blockchain network

582
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
um but it will be one individual or

583
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,440
group

584
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,919
operating under the the guise of

585
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,799
multiple

586
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
blockchain or cryptocurrency addresses

587
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,799
so from an outside perspective

588
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
it may look like the addresses that are

589
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
operating on the blockchain network

590
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
are you know happening from different

591
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
individuals but really it's

592
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,120
one collective group or one individual

593
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,960
who's trying to gain influence on

594
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
that blockchain network so that's a

595
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,640
simple attack

596
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,159
51 attack so this is similar to

597
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,760
building upon the proof of stake

598
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,480
protocol this means that if you control

599
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,360
51 of the mining power on a blockchain

600
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
network

601
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
theoretically you can influence the

602
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,520
blockchain network

603
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,360
to function in ways that it wasn't

604
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
necessarily intended to so this will

605
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,559
would allow you to

606
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
train change historical transactions

607
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,400
modify transactions

608
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
uh double spend um and

609
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
the concept of double spending is

610
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
essentially um

611
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,679
you know buying cryptocurrency and

612
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,640
doubling your money

613
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
in a in a way uh that is not

614
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
meant to be within the balance of the

615
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
the blockchain network

616
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,679
and this is only doable on smaller or

617
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,360
newer blockchain networks and again this

618
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
is theoretical

619
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
but a 51 attack is is not feasible on

620
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
um a bitcoin or ethereum network

621
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
litecoin one of the more popular

622
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,880
uh blockchain networks so a smart

623
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
contract based attack

624
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,720
is the next attack that is a direct

625
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
attack on the blockchain network

626
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
and the most popular

627
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
example of this smart contract based

628
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:22,960
attack was the

629
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,280
decentralized autonomous organization

630
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,720
attack and this was a

631
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,559
vulnerability actually in the ether

632
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,640
cryptocurrency where

633
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
the smart contract was susceptible to

634
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
being exploited

635
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,799
with its withdrawal feature and before

636
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,720
that final confirmation from all the

637
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,679
blockchain

638
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,640
nodes operating on the ethereum network

639
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,480
malicious actor was able to pull out

640
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
funds and i think it was something about

641
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,799
like a hundred million dollars worth

642
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,400
um usd worth in ethereum that they're

643
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,120
able to

644
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,159
exploit out of the dao attack

645
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
so pretty pretty big stuff so that

646
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
covers blockchain attacks

647
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,520
the second bucket is cryptojacking so

648
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
this is essentially

649
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
turning devices in a network into tools

650
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
that'll help you mine a specific

651
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,159
cryptocurrency so this involves um you

652
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
know maliciously taking over

653
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
someone's desktop a laptop a phone and

654
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
adding them into

655
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,080
a malicious mining network so crypto

656
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,799
jacking is is quite popular as well

657
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
and then ransomware so we're gonna dive

658
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
a little deeper into

659
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
this but ransomware in its simplicity is

660
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,640
it's malware that

661
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,039
will encrypt and lock your files until a

662
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:33,840
certain

663
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
financial amount is paid to the

664
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,880
malicious actor that

665
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,039
deployed the the ransomware onto your

666
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,840
account

667
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,240
so let's talk about a brief history of

668
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
ransomware and just how it's evolved

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,799
throughout the years

670
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
so this screenshot is from 1991

671
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,720
and i'm i want to bet that some of you

672
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,039
probably didn't know that ransomware um

673
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,080
was around this

674
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,880
this early or i guess the concept of uh

675
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
holding a ransom and deploying a

676
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
computer malware onto someone's device

677
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,720
for a certain amount of money but with

678
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,840
this

679
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
specific piece of ransomware or this is

680
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,919
referred to as the aids or

681
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,039
pc cyborg ransomware and it was coined

682
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,080
aids because

683
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
this was mailed to i believe in aids

684
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
research distribution

685
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,120
mailing list and pc cyborg because that

686
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
was a fake organization that the

687
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,600
malicious actors would you know make

688
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,559
these victims

689
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,679
pay out the certain payment to so you

690
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,880
could see the note here

691
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,039
uh full amount of 189 or 378 dollars

692
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
um and the way this would work was once

693
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,559
it made its way

694
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,720
onto the victims machine and normally

695
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,159
this

696
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,200
like i mentioned this was through a

697
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
mailing list so typical spearfishing or

698
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
or fishing attachment that would be

699
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,159
clicked on by the victim

700
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
and it would encrypt the the c drive so

701
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,520
this was a windows operated malware

702
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,360
it would encrypt the c drive after after

703
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
90 boots and it would replace the

704
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,919
the batch script um with the trojan

705
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,039
horse that would then load

706
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,400
load this message after after 90 boots

707
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
so this is one of the first you know

708
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,880
really popular instances

709
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
of ransomware but people kind of just

710
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,320
dusted it off and you know one about

711
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,600
their business not really

712
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
worrying about computer security or the

713
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
idea of ransomware

714
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
around this time so let's jump ahead

715
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,799
quite a few years so this is

716
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,799
i think this operating system is xp i

717
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,840
could be wrong

718
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,360
or 2003. um but this this ransomware is

719
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,760
called

720
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,159
archives and again it would operate very

721
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,840
similarly to

722
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,360
how a normal ransomware would work

723
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,279
it would load itself onto the victim

724
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
machine and you'd be

725
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,039
prompted with a message to make a

726
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
certain financial

727
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,279
payment to a certain address or a

728
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,240
certain victim

729
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
or not victim not victim certain

730
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,840
malicious actor

731
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,559
and keep in mind this could be in cash

732
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,360
this could be

733
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,679
in a check order this could be in gift

734
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
cards

735
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
at this time there are a variety of

736
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,080
different

737
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,320
methods and i guess options that

738
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
malicious actors would ask their their

739
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,440
victims to

740
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
to pay out their their ransoms to so

741
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
again this would equip the users files

742
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
and you would be given the password

743
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,000
after making the

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
the certain payment so luckily in 2006

745
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,159
the the password was cracked to archives

746
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,720
so

747
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
if you're one of the unlucky souls to

748
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
somehow

749
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
um get hit by archives or for some

750
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,279
reason or running

751
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,559
windows xp or windows 2003 in a vm

752
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
and you get hit by archives uh the

753
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,039
password is easily googleable

754
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,440
or searchable i don't know if google's

755
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,279
word um

756
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
but you could easily search it up and

757
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,120
just paste it in and you're

758
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,240
free to go um but i hope some

759
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,480
i hope you guys aren't running xp or

760
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
2003 unless you're

761
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
trying to test your buffer overflows or

762
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
something like that

763
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,320
so moving on this is and some of you

764
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,120
guys might have

765
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,520
come across this in just your daily

766
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,159
lives or

767
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,919
just your experiences throughout the

768
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,600
years but this is

769
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,640
referred to as what's called uh police

770
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
ransomware so

771
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,279
this ransomware would make its way to a

772
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,559
victim's machine

773
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
and operate under the guise of scaring

774
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,120
you into thinking

775
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,360
that the operator of this ransomware is

776
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,400
from a legitimate

777
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,760
federal agency so it's not specific to

778
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,840
the us they could have this could happen

779
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,159
across the globe in any specific country

780
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
and they could use

781
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,400
um you know the scare tactics of the

782
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,600
federal government

783
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,240
spying on you to coerce you to making a

784
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,039
certain payment

785
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,799
out and they throw all these different

786
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,960
legal terms um

787
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,320
17 us code s 512 to make it seem

788
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,039
you know very official and that the

789
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
government is legitimately tracking

790
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,039
what you're doing so collected technical

791
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,240
data some of the

792
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,760
information that they'll present back to

793
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,080
you like your ip address your internet

794
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,960
service provider

795
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
the operating system that you're using

796
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,120
some of the things that you might be

797
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,760
doing

798
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,960
even if you're not you know engaging in

799
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
in these things again scare tactics to

800
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,240
coerce you

801
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,279
to making a a payment and keep in mind

802
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
the federal government will never ask

803
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,559
you to to make payments like this

804
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,600
especially just

805
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,919
especially out of the blue and scared

806
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,960
tactics like this

807
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,120
and um you know in the infosec community

808
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
we all basically know this at this point

809
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,480
um

810
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
but you know to help out our relatives

811
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,080
and maybe those who aren't as

812
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
keen on proper cyber hygiene

813
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
and security practices you know just be

814
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
sure to

815
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,919
i guess brief them and let them know

816
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
that if they do come across something

817
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,799
like this

818
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,679
to not fall into the tricks and fall

819
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,320
into

820
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,240
you know the fancy emblems you know you

821
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,679
could literally just look up the nsa

822
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,799
logo on google and

823
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,279
um paste it on your image and somehow

824
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,640
it's officially nsa

825
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,039
official so and then throwing in the

826
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
swat team in there too

827
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,520
don't fall into this i'm sure all of us

828
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,440
are are keenly aware of this but again

829
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,480
a proper cyber security uh and proper

830
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,039
infrastructure in cyberspace really

831
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,440
requires all of us to share the wealth

832
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
and share the information so

833
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,679
this was police ransomware and this

834
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,799
specific

835
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,320
uh version of police ransomware was

836
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
called uh reviton

837
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,399
and i guess a side thing to note was

838
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:40,720
that

839
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,080
in i think around july 2013 this was one

840
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,760
that was pretty popular

841
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
the os x version would use javascript

842
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,840
iframes

843
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,880
and every time you would close a certain

844
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,640
pop-up window another one would pop up

845
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,039
so

846
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,679
it was really annoying when you would be

847
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,039
hit by rebitin

848
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,360
and you would be forced to run like a

849
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
hard reset

850
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,480
on your computer and when you open it

851
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
back up uh the ransomware would still be

852
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
there and you'd be falling back

853
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,799
into the endless clicking you know war

854
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,279
with

855
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,240
with the rabbits and ransomware so that

856
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,760
must have been fun to deal with for

857
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,960
whoever had to

858
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,039
um you know deal with this unfortunate

859
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
situation

860
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
so that's around 2013 and we're jumping

861
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,360
a little ahead

862
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,720
um to about modern times but um

863
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
cryptolocker and wannacry so you might

864
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,000
have

865
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,480
also seen these names in the news but

866
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
cryptolocker

867
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
was the first ransomware that decided to

868
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
switch its demands

869
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
to uh to bitcoin so

870
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
um this was around the september 2013

871
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,120
and may

872
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,480
2014 time span timeline

873
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,559
and there was a large international

874
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,720
effort to take down

875
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,880
the botnet that helped propagate

876
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,159
cryptolocker

877
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,399
among all these different uh machines

878
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:01,360
that were affected

879
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,919
by cryptolocker and the private key

880
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,120
luckily was

881
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
or all the different private keys to

882
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,240
unlock

883
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,640
the cryptolocker affected machines were

884
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
stored on the malicious

885
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
actors command and control server so the

886
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,240
international co-op

887
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,039
or operation carried out by i believe

888
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,000
europol

889
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,919
you know the us department of justice

890
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,120
interpol um

891
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
all these different organizations

892
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
collaborated together to

893
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,520
retrieve these private keys so um those

894
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
affected by cryptolocker could

895
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,080
unlock their computers once again and

896
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,120
then jumping

897
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,159
about three years to wannacry so may

898
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,120
2017

899
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,559
and uh this was huge wannacry affected

900
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,159
um a ton of out-of-band windows devices

901
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,640
that

902
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,080
uh weren't properly patched and uh

903
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,760
the group that was behind wannacry

904
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
the shadow brokers uh utilized the nsa

905
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,919
exploit eternal blue and eternal blue is

906
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,159
an exploit targeted towards

907
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,360
smb or the server message block and

908
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
this exploit worked on a ton of outdated

909
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
windows machines

910
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,240
across the world and it made it

911
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
or this obviously got microsoft's

912
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,600
attention so

913
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,519
microsoft released out of band security

914
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
updates for a lot of these machines but

915
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,519
at that time these machines were already

916
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,640
affected by

917
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,720
eternal blue so it was hard to recover

918
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,760
some of the

919
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
the damage that shadow brokers already

920
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
did

921
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,960
and this was attributed back to to north

922
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,559
korea at some point

923
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,799
and then i also have august 2018 listed

924
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,320
here as a date because that was the most

925
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,200
recent

926
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,559
variant of wannacry that hit taiwanese

927
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,960
semi-conductor manufacturing companies

928
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
um and again

929
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,080
these are new demands because they

930
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,919
started to uh request

931
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
bitcoin rather than your traditional

932
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:52,960
check

933
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,080
cash gift card order um and

934
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
cryptocurrency was evolving in its

935
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
popularity at this time

936
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,600
so taking a look at our timeline now

937
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
we're about

938
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,799
around the 2018 timeline and this is an

939
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,320
infographic from

940
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,600
ibm security showing that uh during 2018

941
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,120
ransomware actually started

942
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,600
to decline and cryptojacking like i

943
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,720
mentioned earlier

944
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,039
in the presentation started to increase

945
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,399
its its popularity

946
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,200
um quite a lot actually you know it

947
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,640
increased pretty steadily throughout the

948
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,200
year

949
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,279
uh in 2018 but despite ransomware's

950
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:33,919
decline

951
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,120
in 2018 um i'm sure many of you are

952
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,840
familiar

953
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,480
that ransomware has not gone away by any

954
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,960
means

955
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,080
if anything it has blown up especially

956
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,360
in the past month or so

957
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,200
so some of the new age ransomware that

958
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,559
um will be covered

959
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,559
the first one is ryok

960
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
and some of you guys might have heard of

961
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
ryok in

962
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,960
the news because it actually has been in

963
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
the news

964
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,519
um pretty recently there was a

965
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,960
huge i guess story around

966
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,559
the trickbot botnet um that would help

967
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,360
propagate the the rio ransomware and

968
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,000
there was

969
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,880
a or there were separate takedowns by

970
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
both the microsoft

971
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
uh threat hunting team and u.s cyber

972
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,679
command

973
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,399
that you know work to take down both

974
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,360
trickbot

975
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,640
and uh ryok and ryuk is in

976
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
it's it's in its own separate field as

977
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,960
well because it's also

978
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,399
been largely targeting health i.t

979
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,440
networks i the most recent example i can

980
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,480
think of

981
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,799
was the takedown of the united health

982
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,559
systems

983
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,880
health i.t networks and it was very

984
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,919
detrimental

985
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,919
um so this specific news headline

986
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,320
uh i believe was from a couple years ago

987
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,679
but this was

988
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,159
when ryok was starting to get popular

989
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:04,840
and

990
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,000
um the way it started to evolve

991
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,839
is ransomware traditionally would target

992
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,119
individual

993
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,760
individuals but now it's starting to

994
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,679
target actual critical infrastructure

995
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,159
like

996
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,399
oil and gas facilities hospitals like i

997
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,280
mentioned

998
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,079
um and then using and targeting a

999
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,599
specific infrastructure

1000
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,520
like active directory so active

1001
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
directory is used and

1002
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,918
i believe it's 95 of enterprise i.t

1003
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,719
networks

1004
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,760
around the world nowadays so um

1005
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,199
the the version of i guess ransomware um

1006
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,839
nowadays is that it's beginning to

1007
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,560
target

1008
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,520
um more of these low-hanging fruit that

1009
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,239
are

1010
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,119
you know really beneficial and essential

1011
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,199
for

1012
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,679
individuals and just normal businesses

1013
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,440
to go about their

1014
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
daily operations so pure locker is an

1015
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,160
interesting case

1016
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,680
because uh the way this ransomware works

1017
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,400
is that

1018
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
it uses the programming language pure

1019
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,599
basic which

1020
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,240
um is a fork off the the basic

1021
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,599
programming language so

1022
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,079
one of the um you know first really

1023
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,680
popular programming languages that some

1024
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,359
of you might have experience with

1025
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,320
um but it's pulled up it's built off

1026
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,880
pure

1027
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,960
basic and it made it really difficult

1028
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
for um

1029
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,200
av and threat intel companies to detect

1030
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,839
this at first because pure basic is so

1031
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,760
underutilized and it was it was pretty

1032
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,079
unusual that they would pick this

1033
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,880
uh specific technology but it seemed to

1034
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,920
work in the malicious actors

1035
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,480
you know favor at the time so i thought

1036
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,720
that was worth noting

1037
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,880
and then there's so do no kibi or you

1038
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
know the easier way to say that is

1039
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
are you evil but ari evil and

1040
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,280
ryok they fall into um

1041
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,560
a family of ransomware that

1042
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,240
most of you i'm sure are familiar with

1043
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,760
but it falls into

1044
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,160
what's called ransomware as a service

1045
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,800
and

1046
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
the way ransomware as a service works is

1047
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
that it functions very similar to just a

1048
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
regular business model

1049
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,400
um these ads for ras

1050
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,640
are scattered all across the dark web

1051
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
and you know once you come across an

1052
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000
ad that's advertising uh ras or

1053
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
just any general ransomware as a service

1054
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,240
they're meant to be very easily deployed

1055
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,680
so you hire the specific threat actor

1056
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
uh you tell them the target that they

1057
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
want you to

1058
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,920
or that you want them to send ransomware

1059
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,480
to

1060
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,079
and it's a very low effort on your end

1061
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
and these ransomware kits are scalable

1062
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,200
based on

1063
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,240
um the package that you want to give the

1064
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,960
specific

1065
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,079
cyber criminal or threat actor that is

1066
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,280
you know willing to propagate and

1067
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,520
you know release this ransomware onto

1068
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,640
you know whoever

1069
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,400
you want to send this ransomware to

1070
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,720
don't don't go around doing that but

1071
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,760
um if that was that's the mindset of

1072
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
malicious actors

1073
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,079
and these are some of the screenshots

1074
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,920
that you'll find for ras

1075
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,400
scattered across the dark web so uh like

1076
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,040
i mentioned

1077
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,440
they really will try to you know sell it

1078
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
as a a market pitch

1079
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
telling you that it's fully customizable

1080
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
you'll get 50 off uh

1081
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,440
the decryption price and it will just

1082
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,040
tell you the different features

1083
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,560
that are offered with the different

1084
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,440
versions of ransomware as a service that

1085
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
are scattered across

1086
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,160
the dark web and an important thing to

1087
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,280
note about

1088
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,320
um these ransomwares is that they

1089
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,040
really heavily emphasize uh the use of

1090
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,000
cryptocurrency

1091
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,960
bitcoin is really popular but re evil

1092
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
specifically so going back a few

1093
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,560
this specific ransomware suite started

1094
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
to recently make the switch

1095
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,320
to monero and again like i mentioned

1096
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,000
manero it's a privacy coin

1097
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
um but just keep down the back of your

1098
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,359
minds and that

1099
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,960
is definitely an important point that i

1100
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,760
will touch upon in a little bit

1101
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,560
so let's talk about the traceability and

1102
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,079
trackability of

1103
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,800
a bitcoin so like i mentioned blockchain

1104
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
in general

1105
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,359
is quite transparent and you can go on a

1106
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,560
um you know a website like

1107
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,880
blockchain.info

1108
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
and look at historical transactions that

1109
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
have happened throughout the

1110
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
longevity of the cryptocurrencies

1111
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,119
network in this case it's bitcoin and

1112
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,079
bitcoin is

1113
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,119
uh one of the most transparent

1114
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,200
there are definitely security features

1115
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,320
and different

1116
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,640
techniques that you can use to to limit

1117
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,079
your traceability on

1118
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,400
your blog on the blockchain network but

1119
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,920
in general you're able to

1120
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
you know pull out some pretty juicy

1121
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,119
information if you

1122
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,560
decide to uh start an investigation on

1123
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,440
maybe a bitcoin address or a transaction

1124
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,760
that

1125
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
might look a little malicious to you

1126
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
might look a little suspicious but you

1127
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
need a little more info

1128
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,680
so you would come to a website like

1129
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,960
blockchain.info and start your

1130
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,359
investigation so this is my pseudo demo

1131
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,200
these are just in screenshots but

1132
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,440
clicking on this transaction ash

1133
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,480
right here will bring us to a summary of

1134
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
the transaction so this bitcoin address

1135
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,720
is sending about half a bitcoin or 0.4

1136
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,000
for bitcoin to this bitcoin address

1137
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
and blockchain.info and all these

1138
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,040
different

1139
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
blockchain tracing websites will give

1140
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
you the ability to look at

1141
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
the metadata and information of this

1142
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,640
specific bitcoin address

1143
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,000
so clicking on the 39 vavs address

1144
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,079
it'll tell us that two transactions took

1145
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,200
place

1146
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,320
it received 0.44 bitcoin but it also

1147
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,079
sent out 0.44

1148
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
bitcoin out of this address

1149
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
so that's some of the information that

1150
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,760
you could pull out from a blockchain

1151
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
explorer from the get-go but what if we

1152
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,359
wanted to learn a little more

1153
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,200
information about this specific bitcoin

1154
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
address

1155
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,599
we could go to uh bitcoin who's who dot

1156
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,160
com

1157
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,960
and we can plug in this address to see

1158
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
if we can gain any more information on

1159
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,079
the specific

1160
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,839
bitcoin address whether it's been

1161
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,640
involved in some fraudulent scam

1162
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,079
whether it's been spotted on the dark

1163
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,040
web and that's really the key feature of

1164
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,880
bitcoin who's who

1165
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,079
providing users the ability to to

1166
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,280
manually update

1167
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,720
and generate reports of specific bitcoin

1168
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,680
addresses

1169
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,920
that might seem malicious or they've had

1170
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,760
some you know bad interaction with

1171
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,319
and a bitcoin who's who will flag that

1172
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,000
uh bitcoin address as

1173
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,040
a scam or potentially malicious so if we

1174
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
click on search here gonna act like i'm

1175
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
clicking on the search button this will

1176
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,400
give us more information

1177
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
than we were able to pull out from just

1178
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,640
the the general transaction history

1179
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,119
searching

1180
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,880
website for this specific bitcoin

1181
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,400
address so

1182
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,680
it tells us that um it belongs to

1183
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,319
this wallet name um and a cryptocurrency

1184
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,760
wallet is essentially where you

1185
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,839
you know store your cryptocurrency uh

1186
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,880
you share out

1187
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
cryptocurrency transactions and normally

1188
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
you will

1189
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,359
or individuals or groups that operate

1190
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,040
wallets will have multiple bitcoin

1191
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,079
addresses

1192
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,920
associated with this wallet and then

1193
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
there's wallet searching software out

1194
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
there as well you could

1195
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,040
look up blockchain wallet or bitcoin

1196
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,880
wallet you know searcher on your

1197
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,079
favorite search engine

1198
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,000
and you know plug this wallet name into

1199
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,440
there as well

1200
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,960
it'll tell you the current balance of

1201
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,640
this bitcoin address

1202
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,160
again how much it's received how much

1203
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
i guess it doesn't show how much it's

1204
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,599
sent out but um it shows you how much

1205
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,640
it's received the

1206
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,480
transactions that were sent out how many

1207
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,839
transactions have happened

1208
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,920
in general the dates of the first and

1209
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,119
last transactions

1210
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,359
a lot of good good information for an

1211
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,880
ocean investigator open source

1212
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,760
intelligence

1213
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,079
or really anyone just trying to to probe

1214
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:52,800
around

1215
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,319
on the blockchain and collect more

1216
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,400
information so that's

1217
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,839
bitcoin who's who just kind of a

1218
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,599
theoretical way to do an investigation

1219
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,880
if we were to do a specific use case

1220
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,720
you guys might remember from a few

1221
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,000
months ago

1222
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,319
former president barack obama generously

1223
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,200
gave the option of people sending a

1224
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,960
thousand dollars to this bitcoin address

1225
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,839
and because you know he's so gracious as

1226
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,359
a president he was willing to

1227
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,520
to double your your payment back to

1228
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,720
yourself so

1229
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,040
um you know people sent this over you

1230
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,400
know crossing their fingers and really

1231
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,200
just hoping

1232
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,880
that they would get back double the

1233
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
amount of their money

1234
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,520
uh lo behold this was a typical scam uh

1235
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,880
the double spending scam

1236
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,640
that some of you might be familiar with

1237
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,000
on uh

1238
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,800
video game platforms like runescape this

1239
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,319
was a scam that's happened

1240
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,000
um all throughout the video game

1241
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
industry but with this specific

1242
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,359
uh incident it wasn't just barack

1243
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,400
obama's

1244
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,160
twitter account that was compromised

1245
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
elon musk's and

1246
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,560
uh i believe coinbase two uh just a

1247
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,640
variety of different high profile

1248
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,760
twitter accounts were

1249
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,640
were compromised but they all had this

1250
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,079
specific bitcoin address

1251
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,280
so for those who were

1252
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
interested or you know just have you

1253
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,359
know general interest in looking into

1254
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,400
cryptocurrencies

1255
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,560
you know providing this bitcoin address

1256
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
had you know these different bitcoin

1257
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,839
investigators

1258
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,400
researchers cryptocurrency researchers

1259
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
foaming at the mouth you know this is

1260
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,520
good information to start your

1261
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
investigation off of so if we were to do

1262
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,079
that

1263
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,480
follow the same methods that we tried

1264
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,480
before

1265
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,680
we'll plug this bitcoin address into

1266
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,040
uh blockchain.info and we see again

1267
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,720
the number of transactions that have

1268
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,480
happened you know a lot of people fell

1269
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,280
for this

1270
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,240
uh bitcoin scam unfortunately uh it

1271
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,160
received over 12 bitcoin

1272
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,079
and if you do the conversions i think

1273
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,599
bitcoin is about

1274
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,119
15 000 usd right now so uh

1275
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,720
this equal i don't want to do that path

1276
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,800
in my head right now but

1277
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,079
i think at the time bitcoin

1278
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,119
12.8 bitcoin equaled out to about 150

1279
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,359
000 us dollars and a key thing to note

1280
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,560
as an investigator

1281
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,520
is that it also sent out the total

1282
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,160
amount

1283
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,640
that it received in bitcoin so that

1284
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,240
tells us that

1285
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,720
the money is not persisting in this

1286
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,960
wallet you'll see a final balance here

1287
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,480
but that's really just the leftover um

1288
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,119
cryptocurrency transaction fees that

1289
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,560
occur from transaction

1290
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,520
to transaction so this is this is just

1291
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,200
arbitrary money

1292
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,839
at this point but seeing this is is

1293
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,599
really important

1294
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,839
so as an investigator or as a you know

1295
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,599
infosec professional if we want to

1296
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,000
go down deeper the rabbit hole we could

1297
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,040
see that

1298
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,119
this bitcoin address the twitter bitcoin

1299
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,880
address sent it out to

1300
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,800
these addresses and we could follow down

1301
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,319
that money trail manually and if we

1302
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,160
want to be organized we could use some

1303
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,760
kind of mind mapping

1304
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,040
software to keep track of um bitcoin

1305
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,839
addresses that

1306
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,160
you know seem interesting or seem like

1307
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,440
they can

1308
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,119
um you know provide a little more

1309
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,440
information but it's very easy to go

1310
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,160
down

1311
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,200
um this intermingled web of

1312
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,920
different bitcoin addresses and um you

1313
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,760
know the format of a bitcoin address

1314
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,960
will you know they will confuse you

1315
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,440
if you decide to go down uh the specific

1316
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,359
rabbit hole of just manually

1317
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,119
clicking through the different

1318
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,200
transactions and there are commercial

1319
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,000
tools out there

1320
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,680
that will help you do this obviously

1321
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,800
they're commercial so you would have to

1322
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,760
pay for them

1323
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
but there are you know different scripts

1324
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,359
on github and different

1325
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,040
open source tools that'll also help

1326
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,720
automate and

1327
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,880
better organize your your investigation

1328
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,240
or just your general research if you

1329
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,400
want to look into a bitcoin address

1330
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,240
so what we can do from here is actually

1331
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,000
plug in this

1332
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,560
bitcoin address into bitcoin who's who

1333
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,680
again

1334
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,920
and if you notice that plugging that

1335
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,560
bitcoin address the bc1 twitter

1336
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,680
address will redirect us to

1337
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,599
this bitcoin address and this is

1338
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,119
obviously different but

1339
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,520
a cool feature of bitcoin who's who is

1340
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,359
because of its scam reporting

1341
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,440
functionality it will help

1342
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,960
cross-correlate

1343
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,280
some of the the information across these

1344
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,240
reports and

1345
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
at some point they were able to

1346
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,800
associate this bitcoin address with the

1347
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,160
original bc1

1348
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,240
twitter bitcoin address and we're

1349
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,920
getting a lot of juicy information

1350
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,119
here so 57 transactions for for this

1351
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,560
address that

1352
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,960
57 is is pretty high for a bitcoin

1353
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,880
address in general 400

1354
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,599
for that twitter bitcoin address was

1355
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
very significant but 57 is still

1356
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,319
uh worth noting and now that we know

1357
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,520
that this address

1358
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,000
is associated with that original uh

1359
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,119
bitcoin address

1360
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,440
twitter bitcoin scam address i'm saying

1361
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,119
bitcoin address a lot

1362
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,400
um we could look at the other fields

1363
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,599
that bitcoin who's who

1364
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,160
can give us and use these as pivot

1365
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,960
points for

1366
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,920
different research points that we could

1367
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,119
further go to

1368
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,880
so from here we can see that the first

1369
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
transaction actually happened

1370
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,480
on may 3rd 2020 but the twitter bitcoin

1371
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,680
scam happened around

1372
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,720
this time frame so july 16 2020. so this

1373
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,000
gives us a timeline

1374
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
of the malicious actors or the cyber

1375
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,359
criminals that were

1376
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,240
operating with this specific bitcoin

1377
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,760
address or maybe at the time they

1378
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,480
weren't even

1379
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,040
specifically involved or you know

1380
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,400
planning on hacking twitter

1381
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,880
at the time but this gives us a timeline

1382
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,400
of you know different transactions we

1383
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,359
can look into

1384
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,880
and start to fingerprint who this

1385
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,040
individual might be

1386
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,960
and probably the most important part

1387
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,040
here is that it actually gives us

1388
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,000
ip addresses for the last transaction

1389
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,079
and i don't have a slide here

1390
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,119
for it but if you plug this ip address

1391
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,079
into or both ip addresses actually into

1392
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,280
some ipg

1393
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,079
locator i forget which one it is but one

1394
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:00,800
of them

1395
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,440
uh redirects to the united kingdom and

1396
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,359
if you look up what happened

1397
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,359
um or the aftermath of the twitter

1398
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,200
bitcoin scam it's actually found

1399
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,760
that one of the uh twitter bitcoin

1400
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,480
scammers

1401
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,240
there were three of them one of them was

1402
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,160
operating at florida he was a 17 year

1403
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,559
old

1404
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,720
and then the other two were i believe

1405
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,480
like 20 21 year olds

1406
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,920
um but one of the the older individuals

1407
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,680
was actually located in the united

1408
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,599
kingdom as well so

1409
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,319
um you know a resource like bitcoin news

1410
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:30,800
who is

1411
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,839
really useful in identifying some of the

1412
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:34,960
key information

1413
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,000
like that and you're able to again it

1414
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,280
doesn't always give you

1415
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,000
information like the ip address or you

1416
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,359
know when the first transaction or last

1417
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,800
transaction happened

1418
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,119
or i should say it's not always useful

1419
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,880
it might just be in the same day or

1420
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,559
someone might use a bitcoin address

1421
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,280
as an individual throwaway address and

1422
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
never use it again

1423
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,480
but again there's a lot of information

1424
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,920
that we could use

1425
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,480
off of here for you know our research

1426
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,119
purposes

1427
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,680
or you know looking into the the bitcoin

1428
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,000
money trail

1429
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,440
so actually if we try to directly paste

1430
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,280
the twitter bitcoin address into bitcoin

1431
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,520
usu unfortunately bitcoin who's who

1432
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,480
doesn't process

1433
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,359
this uh specific format of bitcoin

1434
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:17,839
address

1435
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,760
i believe it's a functionality that

1436
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,119
they're working to implement

1437
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,319
but luckily because of that

1438
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,480
cross-correlation from the past slide

1439
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,599
um we were able to get the information

1440
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,480
we needed to at least continue on uh

1441
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,079
with our research

1442
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,400
so that generally covers you know very

1443
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,119
high level

1444
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,040
um collecting open source intelligence

1445
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,480
on bitcoin and

1446
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,839
you know how easy it is to gain

1447
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,920
really significant information and

1448
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,839
collect information that could be vital

1449
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,520
to either your research your

1450
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,359
investigation um

1451
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,359
or just your general bitcoin

1452
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,440
cryptocurrency interests

1453
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,800
and i kept talking about monero in the

1454
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,640
past but let's actually dive a little

1455
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,319
deeper into it

1456
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,599
so if we were to attempt the same

1457
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,040
sort of methodology with uh narrow

1458
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,240
we're tldr you're not going to get the

1459
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,200
same results

1460
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,559
again monero is a privacy coin it

1461
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,319
has privacy features and security

1462
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,680
features built into

1463
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,599
its core making it that much more

1464
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,800
difficult for

1465
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,520
um investigators and researchers to

1466
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,079
trace and collect information on

1467
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,240
so sudo demo again if we click on i

1468
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,598
believe it's this block hash

1469
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,000
regardless so clicking on you know the

1470
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,960
address that

1471
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,200
um or the hash that's offered um on

1472
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,400
moneroblox.info so it's a similar

1473
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,280
blockchain searching website like uh

1474
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,559
blockchain.info for

1475
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,200
for bitcoin it'll give us transactions

1476
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,400
that

1477
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,599
you know really don't tell us that much

1478
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,680
information actually doesn't give us the

1479
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,480
output total

1480
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,160
so if we click on this transaction hash

1481
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,079
again it really doesn't give us that

1482
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,400
much information at least compared to

1483
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,960
to bitcoin and you know there's not much

1484
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,839
we can really

1485
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,760
pull out of here and again this is

1486
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,880
because

1487
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,960
monero has features that are built into

1488
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,000
its core to

1489
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,559
help ensure its confidentiality and

1490
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,280
there are

1491
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,319
two key features implemented right now

1492
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,400
and then there's one that's actively you

1493
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,040
know being worked on the first one

1494
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,680
are what's called stealth addresses so

1495
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
every transaction

1496
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,359
from outside um from an outside

1497
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,400
perspective so if you go onto

1498
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,920
moneroblocks.inflow and you look at the

1499
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,200
transaction history

1500
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,880
all those addresses are different

1501
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,319
they're one-time addresses for

1502
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,720
the transactions and the only ones who

1503
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,359
will know the legitimate

1504
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,440
addresses going from a receiver to a

1505
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,040
sender

1506
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,599
are the users participating in that

1507
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,240
transaction

1508
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,480
so think of this as the end-to-end

1509
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,680
encrypted version

1510
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,160
of a transaction on a blockchain network

1511
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,160
and monero does this really well because

1512
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,119
of

1513
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,680
their stealth address functionality

1514
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,440
another key feature are what's called

1515
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
ring confidential transactions

1516
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,920
or ring ct these are built off the ring

1517
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,960
signature

1518
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,359
cryptographic protocol i'm not a

1519
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:14,400
cryptography expert by any means but

1520
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,520
in the use case of monero this means

1521
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,000
that from an outside perspective too

1522
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
we saw that all the transactions were

1523
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,480
confidential but if you were able to

1524
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,359
maybe get your hands on an amount or

1525
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,040
some kind of clear text

1526
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,599
amount for the funds being transacted

1527
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,880
between

1528
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,599
an address and another address uh those

1529
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,359
random those funds will

1530
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,800
not be accurate because there are

1531
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,559
randomized funds that are thrown

1532
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,160
into every transaction meant to

1533
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,559
obfuscate um the

1534
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,240
you know actual transaction happening

1535
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,760
between the um

1536
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,520
the different individuals and then

1537
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,200
covering so this is a

1538
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,640
active development feature that's

1539
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,720
incorporating a technology similar to

1540
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,400
tor so onion routing

1541
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
um and again this is just to ensure its

1542
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,760
security and privacy which is so

1543
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,079
essential to the monero network

1544
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,359
i'm running out of time so i'm going to

1545
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,040
have to burst through these next few

1546
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,920
slides

1547
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,240
a little quickly so this is another use

1548
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,960
case and

1549
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,440
just really shows the difficulty of

1550
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,400
tracking

1551
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,839
you know monero address and the the

1552
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,760
us department of treasury operates

1553
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,359
what's called the office of

1554
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,440
uh foreign asset controls and specially

1555
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,880
designated nationals

1556
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,520
black persons list that's a that's a

1557
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,079
mouthful

1558
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,480
but essentially they uh sanction certain

1559
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,520
individuals

1560
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,960
um both in normal fiat

1561
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,079
currency so this is usds and then also

1562
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,240
cryptocurrencies and you'll notice here

1563
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,480
that they've marked a

1564
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
monero address at least what they assume

1565
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,160
to be a monero address

1566
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,480
right here but if we were to go to the

1567
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,160
same

1568
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,400
monero blocks website we'll actually see

1569
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,319
that this is a payment id

1570
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,800
this is an address associated to an

1571
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
individual these are

1572
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,000
arbitrary outside identifiers given

1573
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,359
to a transaction um you know by the

1574
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,319
specific

1575
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,480
exchange that the individuals are

1576
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,319
operating on or wherever they're sending

1577
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,359
monero from

1578
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,280
so sanctioning the payment id

1579
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,400
essentially does

1580
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,319
nothing and this is really just to show

1581
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,520
how difficult it is to track monero

1582
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,440
and point it back to a certain

1583
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,720
individual and

1584
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,760
just honestly applause to the

1585
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,920
monero team monero research team for

1586
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,960
putting that much effort

1587
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,920
into ensuring the security and privacy

1588
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,400
of

1589
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,240
you know individuals operating with

1590
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,400
monero but again obviously there

1591
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,280
are uh it's there's gray area for cyber

1592
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,319
criminals

1593
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,799
now switching over to monero and

1594
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,079
increasing their

1595
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,760
um lack of traceability i would say

1596
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,960
you know making it that much more

1597
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,520
difficult for law enforcement to track

1598
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,119
them down and they continue

1599
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,359
to operate with their listed activities

1600
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,400
so this is my kind of conclusion slide

1601
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,680
so why does this all matter

1602
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,960
in the i guess the the time frame of

1603
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,480
you know kobe 19 we've been in

1604
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,559
quarantine for about um

1605
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,640
eight nine months now almost the entire

1606
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,720
year working remotely

1607
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,119
and not everyone has this luxury but for

1608
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,000
the infosec

1609
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,319
world you know this is something that we

1610
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,520
have been blessed with

1611
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,280
working remotely definitely makes us

1612
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,880
more susceptible we're

1613
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,559
on our devices constantly and you know

1614
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,880
i think the human aspect definitely

1615
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
falls into this because

1616
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,119
we're so used to being around our

1617
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,280
devices and our work laptops you know

1618
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,280
so often uh we can kind of get

1619
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,040
complacent um

1620
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,200
in terms of keeping up with our cyber

1621
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,480
hygiene so

1622
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,559
this is more of just a you know a

1623
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,520
reminder to

1624
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,680
you know be resilient and make sure

1625
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,960
you're

1626
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,240
um practicing safe cyber practices

1627
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,480
discovery of insecure software so this

1628
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,920
was you know definitely key in the

1629
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,480
beginning

1630
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,880
of kobe 19 you might have mentioned

1631
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,720
remember the the zoom vulnerabilities

1632
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,839
that were going around

1633
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,200
huge um tick tock you know large talks

1634
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,520
around security vulnerabilities there

1635
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,160
just the the general nature of the

1636
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,480
platform and who it's being operated by

1637
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,599
cyber crime has risen exponentially

1638
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,599
during coven 19 especially in the the

1639
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,359
past month and then

1640
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,400
just in general digital currency um in

1641
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,799
my

1642
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,040
view is definitely going to become one

1643
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,240
of the standards of the financial

1644
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,960
industry

1645
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,960
whether it is decentralized or

1646
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,160
centralized so

1647
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,319
um certain governments around the world

1648
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,599
have started to implement a digital

1649
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,400
currency

1650
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,079
um but is being operated by the

1651
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,079
government so it's not necessarily

1652
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,319
blockchain based it's not decentralized

1653
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,359
but

1654
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,960
in general digital currency virtual

1655
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,559
currency will definitely become one of

1656
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,760
the norms

1657
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,200
as we begin to to go through these years

1658
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,559
and then these are some of the resources

1659
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,480
that i recommend

1660
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,160
there's a book dedicated to

1661
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,760
investigating cryptocurrencies

1662
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,400
uh there's a podcast video series uh

1663
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,359
dedicated to

1664
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,440
monero and some of the vulnerabilities

1665
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,280
and then just generally hunting cyber

1666
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,000
criminals

1667
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,920
uh this is something i like to to do in

1668
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,839
my free time and just do

1669
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,520
open source investigations and

1670
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,880
participate

1671
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,119
in the trace labs missing persons

1672
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,799
capture the flag competitions

1673
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,640
really cool stuff if you are not aware

1674
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,160
about that um

1675
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,000
but that being said that brings me to

1676
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
the end of my presentation

1677
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,520
are there any questions and here's my

1678
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,599
contact info there's my email

1679
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,480
my twitter feel free to follow me and

1680
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,359
then my linkedin too

1681
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,480
feel free to connect with me but um does

1682
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,680
anyone have any questions

1683
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,720
let me take a look at the

1684
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,799
does blockchain have a use case in

1685
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,480
voting and reducing voter fraud

1686
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,760
yes so great question um

1687
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,520
obviously from the beginning blockchain

1688
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,040
you know as an inherently secure

1689
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,400
platform was proposed as a solution to

1690
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,799
ensuring electoral integrity and

1691
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:05,760
security

1692
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,960
um and honestly i don't know

1693
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,200
all the specific reasons but in general

1694
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,319
blockchain

1695
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,200
um is not only difficult to implement

1696
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:15,680
into

1697
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,960
uh an electoral system uh voting system

1698
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,319
but it it's hard to

1699
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,240
it becomes very muddled when it comes to

1700
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,359
being able to

1701
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,240
identify voters and you know ensuring

1702
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,880
that

1703
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,599
um you know proper identifications and

1704
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,280
guardrails are in place to

1705
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,240
ensure that uh voter counts are you know

1706
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,280
not tampered with

1707
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,760
and you know counted and i know that's

1708
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,880
kind of a non-answer

1709
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,240
but um blockchain is not the solution to

1710
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,839
election security but um shout out to

1711
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:48,880
you know the cyber security

1712
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
infrastructure and security agency team

1713
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,960
for you know providing the most secure

1714
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,319
uh election

1715
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,480
in american history i think you know

1716
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,599
that is a big feat

1717
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,040
in itself and they didn't have to use

1718
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,880
blockchain so i think that's worth

1719
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,799
noting but down the line i think if

1720
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,319
they're able to find a more robust

1721
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,359
solution

1722
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,960
to implementing blockchain i think it

1723
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,799
definitely could work i think just some

1724
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,520
of the

1725
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,920
um the functionality and features of

1726
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,799
privacy

1727
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,359
um incorporated into blockchain are a

1728
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,000
little difficult to deconflict when it

1729
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,599
comes to

1730
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,119
being able to identify voters and

1731
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,599
confirm that voters are legitimately

1732
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:26,319
registered

1733
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,960
with you know a certain system

1734
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,000
so other questions actually there are

1735
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,480
still many

1736
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,520
yes that that is very crazy point of

1737
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,200
sale systems um

1738
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,520
i'm sure you guys know are big targets

1739
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,079
so um

1740
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:46,960
yeah they're they're definitely

1741
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,520
susceptible to vulnerabilities or

1742
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,720
like the archives ransomware or or even

1743
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,440
zero days that have been patched on

1744
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
modern day machines but you know pos

1745
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,880
systems like you mentioned are

1746
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,280
pretty outdated manufacturing has plenty

1747
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,520
too

1748
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,960
thanks chris shout out to another chris

1750
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,440
yeah so it doesn't look like there's any

1751
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,920
other questions

1752
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,520
