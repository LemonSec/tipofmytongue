1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:06,799
so

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,360
very excited about this next talk uh

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
from wendy knox everett

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,799
who is noteworthy for a couple of

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,120
reasons one

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
she's a lawyer working at leviathan

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
security and it's always great to meet a

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
lawyer at a security firm

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
because they'll actually keep your stuff

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,439
straight

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,840
second she's going to tackle uh

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,640
something that

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,439
is surprisingly relevant to a lot of us

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,480
which is

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,200
sock two right this is the compliance

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,920
model

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
that we all need to do so we all spend

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,120
our days and nights thinking about

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
security

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
but at the end of the day someone has to

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
show whether or not we're doing what we

22
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
have to and wendy's going to dive into

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
that security assurance and third and

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
something that i'm the most proud of

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
is that wendy once upon a time was my

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,840
intern at ntia and she kind of broke the

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,559
mold for

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
all other following interns uh she's

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,120
just a bloody rock star in fact she's

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,399
better than a rock star

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
she's a willie nelson so i think you'll

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
find this is going to be one of the more

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
interesting compliance oriented talks

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
you'll ever see

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
so take it away wendy

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
hi and welcome to our exploration of all

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
things sock 2 at besides lv

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,759
2021 so you might be saying

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
what i may have heard that term before

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
but i have no idea what it means

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
well you're in the right talk to learn

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
some more sock 2 audits are designed to

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
provide a way for organizations to

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,079
demonstrate to customers that they have

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
at least a minimal set of security

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
controls and some oversight in place

47
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,920
many companies have built software as a

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
service or web hosted software tools

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
seek out a sock 2 audit

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
to provide a security maturity signal to

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
their potential customers

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,399
and hi i'm wendy i'm a senior security

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,240
advisor at leviathan security group

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
i work with startups to help build their

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
security programs and grow their

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,719
enterprise sales

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,960
as part of that i often help them go

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
through their first sock 2 audits

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
so today i'm going to share some of that

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
knowledge with you

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,079
this talk is really designed as an

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,318
introduction to sock stock2 audits

63
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,520
we're going to walk through what it

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
would cover and discuss preparing for

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
your first audit

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
and how to make sure your company is set

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
up for success

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,239
so what even are we talking about there

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
are several types of security program

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,480
audits

71
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
like iso 27001 bedram or high trust

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
each of these at a really high level

73
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
tries to check whether the audited

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,599
company

75
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
has functional security controls in

76
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
place some of these like fedramp

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,680
are required before the company can sell

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,200
their software to a particular type of

79
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
customer

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
like federal agencies in the case of

81
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
fedramp but some are voluntary

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,239
like stock 2 and iso audits usually are

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,160
but if it's voluntary why would any

84
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
company willingly undergo a security

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,200
audit

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
well in this age of storing your

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
sensitive information and systems that

88
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,239
you haven't built and don't operate

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,040
yourself

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,159
like using salesforce or aws or jira you

91
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,760
want somebody to ensure that these tools

92
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,000
will protect your proprietary data

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
and in turn if you're selling a tool

94
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,920
that will hold sensitive data

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
from your enterprise customers they want

96
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,680
insurances from you

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
the sock 2 certification is one way that

98
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
you can demonstrate that you're capable

99
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,760
of protecting sensitive data

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
understand of course that while audits

101
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,040
can demonstrate a certain level of

102
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
organizational maturity

103
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
and require some evidence of some

104
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
security safeguards it don't really mean

105
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
that a site is unhackable

106
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
and indeed really nothing can

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,560
let's pause here to know an important

108
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
distinction between audits

109
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,239
and assessments assessments can be

110
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
thought of as more informal check

111
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
checkups using a control set to generate

112
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,560
a list of gaps for an organization

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,239
audits are a little more formal and

114
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,599
usually require the auditing

115
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
firm have a certain set of credentials

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
so for a sock 2 audit

117
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
the auditing firm for instance must be a

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
licensed cpa heard

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
also note that these audits do not cover

120
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
technical security controls such as

121
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
protections against sql injection or

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,000
cross-site scripting

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
to check for those you will need to book

124
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,720
a penetration test of your application

125
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
and so let's jump on into discussing

126
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
sock 2 audits and how you can prepare

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,959
for one

128
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
every audit will check your program

129
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
against a set of rules that we refer to

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,199
as a control set

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
for a sock 2 audit your program will be

132
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,399
checked against at least

133
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,840
one of the five trust services criteria

134
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
those are as we see security

135
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
availability

136
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,880
processing integrity confidentiality

137
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,600
and privacy out of all these five only

138
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
security is mandatory and you can pick

139
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
which other ones you might like to

140
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
include the security principle

141
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
verifies that your information and

142
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
systems are protected against

143
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,520
unauthorized access

144
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
auditors will look for processes to

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
prevent or detect

146
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
security issues like breakdowns and

147
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
circumventions of

148
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
segregation of duty controls detections

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
of system failures

150
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
theft or any other unauthorized access

151
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
or removal of information

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
the availability principle meanwhile

153
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,960
covers checks to ensure that information

154
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
systems

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
are available for use the sock 2

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
availability principle

157
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
doesn't actually mandate a particular

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
sla like 5 9's

159
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,000
instead it requires that you have

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,160
monitoring and operating processes to

161
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
support your defined slas

162
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
if you're running on a cloud platform

163
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,919
like aws some of the

164
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
implementation of this principle is just

165
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
inherited from aws's sock too

166
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
however you do still need to set up

167
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
monitoring and alerting for your vms or

168
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
processes that run within aws

169
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
you'll need to do some other things like

170
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,600
disaster recovery testing

171
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
the confidentiality principle checks to

172
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
see the organization has a way to check

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
information that's designated as

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
sensitive can you limit

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,479
its access to it you limit the use and

176
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
retention and restrict disclosure only

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
to people authorized to view it

178
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
again if you're running on a cloud

179
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
platform a lot of the implementation of

180
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,440
this principle can be inherited from

181
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
that cloud platform stock too if they

182
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
have one

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
although you will still need some things

184
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
like a data classification policy

185
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,240
and if your user laptops are in scope

186
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,520
you need to have an end of life

187
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,039
procedure to protect the data

188
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,440
on those disks so those three principles

189
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
security availability and

190
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,479
confidentiality

191
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
are the three most common ones included

192
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,479
in the esoc 2 audit

193
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
but there are also two other ones you

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,919
might want to include if they need sense

195
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
for your platform

196
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,240
the processing integrity principle

197
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
verifies your organization has controls

198
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
to ensure completeness

199
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
accuracy timeliness and authorization of

200
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
systems processing

201
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
it looks to see if you set up procedures

202
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
and systems to ensure that information

203
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,479
processing is free from error delay

204
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,120
emission

205
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
and unauthorized or inadvertent

206
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,599
manipulation

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
meanwhile privacy principle checks

208
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,759
whether personal information

209
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,720
or pii is usually refer to it that is

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
collected used and retained

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,479
is managed according to a few points

212
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
that are very similar to other privacy

213
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
regimes like the gdpr or ccpa

214
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,400
there are notice and consent

215
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
verifications that check whether your

216
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
organization tells users what

217
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,599
information they collect

218
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
and what they're going to do with it the

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
auditor also will check if organization

220
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
limits the use and retention of the pii

221
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
if you have procedures to notify users

222
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
in case of a data breach

223
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
finally as with most of these controls

224
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,039
the auditor will look to see if you have

225
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
monitoring and enforcement of these

226
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,758
controls

227
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,759
so you might have noticed that two of

228
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,759
these confidentiality and privacy

229
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,319
are really similar they're actually two

230
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,639
distinct concepts

231
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,479
confidentiality checks to see if you

232
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,400
protect data deem sensitive by your

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
organization

234
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
perhaps including things like your

235
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,199
source code

236
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
meanwhile privacy looks at the controls

237
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,759
around shielding pii from accidental

238
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,639
disclosure

239
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
or misuse

240
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,520
so for each of these broad categories

241
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
we need to build a set of policies and

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
procedures for your program

243
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
that will implement the principles in

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,319
each category and which will be our

245
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
control set that we are audited against

246
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,120
the controls that we build could be

247
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,360
custom to our program and so this is a

248
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
way in which sock 2 is a little bit

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
different from a more prescriptive

250
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,720
program like fedramp

251
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
so long as they fully implement all the

252
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
relevant principles under each category

253
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
that we are going to be auditing against

254
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
so this sounds pretty generic and fuzzy

255
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200
so let's jump on in to some specifics

256
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
the trust services criteria are the

257
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
foundation and most stock 2

258
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,959
audits under each section there are

259
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
several coso principles

260
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,640
and call outs directing auditors for

261
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
what to look for

262
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
you can find each of these in a pdf

263
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
that's hosted online at this url and i

264
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,560
will tweet out my slides later if you

265
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
need to grab this

266
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,440
so let's take a look at one here's

267
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,120
one under the security category cc

268
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,320
1.3 tells us we need management to work

269
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
with their independent oversight

270
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,839
which is usually the board of directors

271
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,760
to develop a security organization that

272
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
has a charter and

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,320
clear lines of reporting and

274
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
responsibility

275
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
so note that some audit firms would give

276
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
you a set of controls that they're used

277
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,200
to working with that implement the tsps

278
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,519
however we found that smaller companies

279
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,040
is often better to create your own

280
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
control wording

281
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,519
that aligns with how you have

282
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,080
implemented each of these tsps

283
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
so for instance if you use a federated

284
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
identity management or cicd pipelines

285
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,160
let's make sure the control wording

286
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,880
reflects that so let's take a look at

287
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
two example controls that implement

288
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
this principle here

289
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
we want to write a control for our

290
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
control set but what's the idea of

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,640
authorizing and defining our recording

292
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
structure into action

293
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
an org chart is one way that you can

294
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,800
embody your organization's structure

295
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
and so first we'll write a control that

296
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
will use an art chart to track

297
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,560
who reports to who and who is in which

298
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
department

299
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,279
don't forget to account for any

300
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
contractors trump employees or interns

301
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,880
who work for you

302
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,320
and here we have a second control

303
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
reflecting that

304
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
you also need to make sure that you have

305
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
all of your policies created and

306
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
approved by management

307
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,480
you will need an overarching information

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,760
security policy

309
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
that sets up your program and includes

310
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,959
information about

311
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
who your security officers are and what

312
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
their charter is

313
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
other policies should cover areas like

314
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
access control and risk management that

315
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,120
we'll look at

316
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
very soon so some stock 2 audits

317
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
need to collect evidence to show that

318
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
you're following your controls

319
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,200
keep in mind that we need to create

320
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
evidence artifacts that show

321
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
that they are operating within our

322
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
organization we'll dig a little more

323
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
into that shortly

324
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,600
so let's first have a look at a couple

325
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
of the main areas

326
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,880
that we will be responsible for

327
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
implementing in particular

328
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,519
under the security and availability

329
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
principles

330
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
remember you need to develop policies

331
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
for each of these areas

332
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
access control is a really big area for

333
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,839
sock 2 audits

334
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,360
like most security control

335
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,680
implementations and getting this right

336
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,399
can make your other checks much easier

337
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:22,880
of course

338
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
using a federated identity management

339
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,320
system like octa can simplify this a lot

340
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
it's actually not absolutely necessary

341
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
here's one of our principles cc 6.1

342
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
there are several kosovo principles that

343
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,560
touch on access control

344
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,079
but this is the one that usually most of

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
the technical processes will fit under

346
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
in that pdf there are several relevant

347
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
points that tell the auditors what to

348
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
check for when assessing

349
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
your access controls

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
and here's an example control we would

351
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
put in place to implement

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,880
these checks within our organization for

353
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
all the systems in our audit scope

354
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
you want to have a control to capture

355
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,560
how users authenticate into that system

356
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
we also want to address the least

357
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
privileged access to cc 6.1

358
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
for using aws a control like this is a

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
great way to capture this

360
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
other things you need to set up

361
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
procedures for and right controls to

362
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,680
cover

363
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
will be security basics like onboard

364
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,279
offboarding

365
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
user access control reviews you'll want

366
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,240
someone who owns each of those processes

367
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
for startup it might just be one person

368
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,079
but in a larger company

369
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,639
it will probably be several people you

370
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
also need to make sure you're

371
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
implementing security awareness training

372
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
and track who received the training

373
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
and when this really doesn't need to be

374
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
anything fancy

375
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
you can build a simple training yourself

376
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,839
to cover how to say

377
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,160
securely use your email system how to

378
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
configure mfa

379
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,800
and teach users how to escalate

380
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,639
potential security problems

381
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,240
and then track who you give the training

382
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
to and when

383
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
another critical area is change

384
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
management aka ensuring

385
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
only modifications to software systems

386
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,839
that we expect to be implemented are

387
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,480
implemented

388
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
here's one of the principles that covers

389
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
this area it pretty much

390
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,720
says that we verify and that we track

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
modifications

392
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
so if you're using a rigid waterfall

393
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,360
development flow

394
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
it can be pretty obvious how to

395
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
implement this and many times

396
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
the control sets that others come with

397
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,839
assume that you're using a formal sdlc

398
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,680
in a waterfall flow

399
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
however you can also meet this principle

400
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
in agile environments that deploy

401
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,440
hundreds of times per day

402
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
using automated testing and ci cd

403
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
pipelines

404
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
note that these are some of the points

405
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
the auditor will look for

406
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
and we can do each one of these in that

407
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,240
agile cloud environment

408
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,040
so for example here are two controls

409
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
showing how we can meet this principle

410
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,560
without that formal waterfall splc

411
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
note how we capture some of the points

412
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
the auditors look for

413
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
documenting and testing changes in a way

414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that shows how our cloud-based system

415
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,639
handles them

416
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
another area that we need to cover is

417
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
patching and updates

418
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
we'll need a policy stating what our

419
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
patching timeline is so for example

420
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,399
critical fixes

421
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,440
may be fixed within 24 hours less

422
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
critical ones that we rate medium

423
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
within a week and we will need to retain

424
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
logs to show in our security patches

425
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
that we've installed

426
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
on in-scope systems we also need to

427
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:28,560
perform

428
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
regular security testing such as getting

429
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,720
an annual penetration test

430
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,880
and then show that we've remediated any

431
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
issues found

432
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,760
during that test one area

433
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
where a lot of smaller companies are

434
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,959
unsure how to begin

435
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,000
is risk management you want to make sure

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
you think about and

437
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,720
write down all the risks to your

438
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,040
business especially any areas that are

439
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,959
vulnerable to fraud

440
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,519
you will document each risk and its

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,399
severity

442
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,360
impact and likelihood rating such as low

443
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,639
medium and high

444
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,360
into a risk register which you can store

445
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,079
in a tool

446
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
like jira or spreadsheet you can

447
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
certainly use very complicated custom

448
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
risk management tools

449
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
but spreadsheets are also fine for your

450
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
first few years in a sock too

451
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
you definitely want to make sure you

452
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
document an annual review of each risk

453
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
as well as compensating controls that

454
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
you've implemented

455
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
a sock 2 auditor will definitely want to

456
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,399
make sure that you have a way to be

457
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,600
notified

458
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,959
of system outages or security incidents

459
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,440
for this area you might want to show how

460
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
you use guard duty

461
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
capture screenshots availability

462
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,639
alerting you've configured

463
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
do a screen share walkthrough of your

464
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
sim or your other security tools

465
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,399
and to show post-mortem write-up a past

466
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
availability or security incidents

467
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,399
particularly if you can tie them to

468
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,199
patches that you

469
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
need to correct the root causes being

470
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,079
able to track improvements you need as a

471
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,160
result of these postmortem reviews

472
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,680
will definitely help show that you have

473
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
a mature program in place

474
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
so once we've implemented various

475
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
policies and processes

476
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,279
to meet all these sections of the

477
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,600
security section

478
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,199
how do we ensure that the processes are

479
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,440
being followed within our company

480
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,880
a sock 2 auditor will ensure that you've

481
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,519
verified everything is running smoothly

482
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,040
there are a couple different ways to do

483
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,600
this

484
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
some of the nice ones are involved the

485
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
use of automated tooling

486
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
like turning on branch protection github

487
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,880
to ensure that code reviews

488
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,920
are being done your team will also want

489
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
to meet regularly to perform some checks

490
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
to ensure policies are being followed

491
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
were all access control reviews finished

492
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
last quarter

493
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,839
do all production systems still have

494
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,000
appropriate monitoring implemented

495
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
and alerting the right teams if you do

496
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
these checks monthly or on some other

497
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
regular cadence

498
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
you should then write up short minutes

499
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,279
documenting what you verified

500
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,079
and any corrections you put in place

501
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
congrats you now have a lightweight

502
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,480
internal audit process

503
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,039
here's one example that we've set up

504
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,199
that breaks down various internal task

505
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,480
checks by month

506
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,079
but you can use any schedule that works

507
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,919
for your company

508
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,000
note here that for each section

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
including access control review

510
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
and workstation controls here we have

511
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,240
both the security controls

512
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,319
that security or it or developers should

513
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,439
be doing

514
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,319
and our second meta level of internal

515
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
audit review that we will be doing

516
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
in order to verify our controls are

517
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,840
correctly being followed

518
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
so now we've reviewed a couple of the

519
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,679
areas that sock 2 audits generally cover

520
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
we want to look at how we would show

521
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
that our organization

522
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
is implementing and following all of

523
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,400
these controls throughout our period

524
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
these are two controls we discussed

525
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
earlier

526
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,520
to implement cc 1.3 in our organization

527
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,120
but how would we prove to an auditor

528
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,760
that we're following these

529
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
here are two possible types of evidence

530
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
we could use for this control

531
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
good evidence is generated by a system

532
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,000
your employees use all the time

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
not something you need to remember to

534
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,000
backfill so something like gusto

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,919
which you may be using to manage payroll

536
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,039
or benefits

537
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
is a great tool to lean on for evidence

538
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
generation

539
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,919
it should already be up to date and give

540
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,960
us accurate evidence

541
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
and also here are two types of tools we

542
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,559
could use to show

543
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,720
that contractors have defined managers

544
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
within an organization

545
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,440
and remember as you gather this evidence

546
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
you can redact sensitive information

547
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
like salary information and a screenshot

548
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,640
of the payroll system

549
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,520
what about these other controls for

550
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
these

551
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
we would likely be taking screenshots of

552
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,840
the cicd pipeline

553
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
or the security group configuration

554
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,400
files auditors need to authenticate the

555
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,679
evidence that you provide

556
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,280
and so they may ask that you do a screen

557
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,880
share or project

558
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
in a conference room as you log into the

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,039
system to run the tools and take these

560
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
screenshots or capture these logs

561
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
so you might have heard that there are

562
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
two types of sock 2 audits

563
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,720
a sock 2 type 1 and the sock 2 type 2.

564
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,480
when you go to have your sock 2 audit

565
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
performed you'll have to choose which

566
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
one you want done

567
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,640
both a type 1 and a type 2 look at the

568
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,679
same principles

569
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,200
and you would use the same control set

570
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
for both the difference

571
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,120
is what sort of evidence you would

572
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
provide and the time period the audit

573
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
looks at

574
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,760
a sac two type one a little more of a

575
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
proof of concept on it

576
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
it checks to see if your controls if

577
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,480
implemented correctly

578
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
would fulfill the principles you're

579
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
being audited against

580
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,440
if you've never done a stock 2 audit

581
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
before it's a very good idea to start

582
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
with a type 1

583
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,039
during the type 1 the auditor will look

584
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
at your policy documentation

585
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
you'll often ask to see screenshots and

586
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
other evidence of the implementation of

587
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
your controls

588
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,799
but for each control you need only show

589
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,919
that was exercised

590
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120
once so for example your hr onboarding

591
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
controls

592
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
you may be able to pick a recent

593
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
employee and show that this chosen

594
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
employee

595
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,280
signed an nda and receive security

596
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
awareness training

597
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,919
and show their onboarding checklist for

598
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,480
a type

599
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,559
2 you will need to show that all of your

600
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
controls operated

601
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
over everything over the entire period

602
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
of the audit

603
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,720
populations are requested on your

604
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
auditor for all the

605
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
the people who worked in your company or

606
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
perhaps all the jira tickets for code

607
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
that was deployed to your production

608
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,840
system

609
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
full list of your releases or your

610
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
versions from github

611
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
or perhaps all the end points in your

612
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
inventory or all the subscriptions

613
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
in your cloud each one of these

614
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
lists will be then used to request

615
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
specific pieces of evidence to show

616
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679
control operation

617
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,320
if you are doing a type 1 audit this is

618
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
a little bit less important

619
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
an auditor might ask for a list of your

620
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,000
employees and type 1

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,280
just to ensure you're tracking the

622
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
information could generate it

623
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,880
but they likely won't select particular

624
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,840
items from that list to ask for evidence

625
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,159
about

626
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
however in a type 2 an auditor will want

627
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
to authenticate your population polls

628
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
which might be done with screen sharing

629
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,559
and then we would want to simply

630
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,679
so if you're doing a type 2 audit

631
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
the auditor will want to make sure that

632
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
your control is always operated during

633
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,679
the test period

634
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
they do this with sampling the auditor

635
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
will randomly select the subset of items

636
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,159
from your populations and ask you to

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
provide evidence that you control

638
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,559
operated

639
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,600
on those samples so for example

640
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
they may ask for the full list of all

641
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
your employees hired during the test

642
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,039
period such as over the last six months

643
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,360
or over last year

644
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
from that they may select a set of

645
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
employees and ask you to provide

646
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
the signed nda's onboarding checklist

647
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,240
evidence that a permission group owner

648
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
granted permission for each permission

649
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,960
type they have such as access to an aws

650
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
environment or github permissions

651
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
you would do that for every employee

652
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,879
selected in that sample

653
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
so as you build your controls and

654
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
procedures

655
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
think about how you routine artifacts

656
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,039
that show that the procedure was

657
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,640
followed

658
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,600
also think about retention if you have a

659
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,039
control that says that you run

660
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,640
automated tasks on every production

661
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,440
release make sure that you retain logs

662
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,799
from all the test runs

663
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
during that test period if your test

664
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,799
period is one year long

665
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,679
but you only keep two weeks of test rent

666
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,559
logs

667
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,640
you have no way to prove to the auditor

668
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
that the tests ran for the other 50

669
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,280
weeks

670
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,840
and this can lead to a control failure

671
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
so the best types of evidence are those

672
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
that are created by the system used to

673
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
do the action

674
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
and which require users to have logged

675
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,000
in or otherwise authenticated themselves

676
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
to it so that you know who did the

677
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
action

678
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,159
ideally also with a time stamp with our

679
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
automated test control

680
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
your ci cd pipeline should automatically

681
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
create a test log

682
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
it's great just make sure that they're

683
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,799
being retained on a disk somewhere

684
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
if you have a control that says that you

685
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
do access control reviews

686
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,919
try to use a tool that logs if the

687
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,400
review happened so for example

688
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
you could build a tool that generates

689
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
newly populated google spreadsheet with

690
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,280
all the members of each

691
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,159
aws security group and email that to the

692
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,000
group owners each quarter

693
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,360
they could then add a note to the

694
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
spreadsheet about whether the member

695
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
should still have access

696
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,200
or whether they removed them now you

697
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
have authenticated evidence in that

698
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
google sheet with timestamps showing

699
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,720
that the access control reviews happened

700
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,480
audit scope by the way is something we

701
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
referred to a few times here

702
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,039
it is a definition of what systems are

703
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,720
actually reviewed in the audit

704
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
for a stock 2 report the auditor will

705
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,640
help you with a system description

706
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,000
that goes into the beginning of your

707
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
audit report in which describes the

708
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
scope of the system is covered

709
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,320
do you want to restrict your sock 2 to

710
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
just your aws

711
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
or gcp environment our user laptops and

712
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,559
scope as well

713
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,960
your auditor will probably have input on

714
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
that but you should think ahead of time

715
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,039
about the advantages and disadvantages

716
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
of various scopes

717
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,559
so we've talked a lot about what audit

718
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,240
firms will look for

719
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,679
during your sock 2 audit let's also chat

720
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,200
a little bit about how you can select

721
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,640
the firm to do your audit

722
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
this can be a really big scary choice

723
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,919
if you want a reputable firm who you can

724
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,640
work well with

725
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,960
if you've built your control set to

726
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
match your company's security

727
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,240
program and how you operate as a company

728
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
and you might want to find a farm that

729
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
can audit you against your own control

730
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
set

731
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
some firms will be able to check that

732
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
your control set fully implements

733
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,360
esp's and they may then have slight

734
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,120
adjustments to ensure

735
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,559
that you're correctly implementing the

736
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,600
tsps often they will add supplementary

737
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,039
controls at this point

738
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,400
or they may point out that you have

739
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
duplicate controls that can be merged

740
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,080
together

741
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
but some firms may only be able to audit

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
you against their standard set of

743
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,000
controls

744
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,159
these controls could be overly

745
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,840
cumbersome for smaller or

746
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
agile shops you should have a very frank

747
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
discussion with the audit firm

748
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,880
about what control set they will use and

749
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,559
what evidence they will expect you to

750
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,200
provide

751
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,919
for each of these discuss with them how

752
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,600
much flexibility there might be

753
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
in their control set and any gaps that

754
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,640
they see

755
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,840
in any controls that you bring to the

756
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
table

757
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,559
similarly each firm will collect

758
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,240
evidence in a different way

759
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,400
it's a very good idea to ask to see a

760
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,320
screen share of how this tool works for

761
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
the firm

762
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,520
and you're going to spend a lot of time

763
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,440
interfacing with it

764
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
is it clear to you how you will tie

765
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
uploaded evidence to a particular

766
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,960
control

767
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
definitely make sure you discuss how

768
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
they handle situations where

769
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
one piece of evidence addresses many

770
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
controls

771
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
how do they let you know if a piece of

772
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
evidence is inadequate and you need to

773
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,720
provide a different screenshot or log

774
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,559
finally can you easily communicate

775
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
status through the platform

776
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,400
do you know when they have done done an

777
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
initial sign off on a control or when

778
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
they need

779
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
more information or more screenshots or

780
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
better screenshots of timestamps in them

781
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,840
from you

782
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,279
those pandemic a lot of audits have

783
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,000
shifted

784
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
from a few people squeezed into a

785
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
conference room for a week

786
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
more virtual events perhaps some kickoff

787
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,320
video conferencing

788
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
and screen sharing walkthroughs but

789
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,559
otherwise a little bit more asynchronous

790
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
rounds of evidence collection

791
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
and review facilitated by the audit

792
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
firm's evidence collection tool

793
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,919
you will want to ensure that the firm

794
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,320
understands what your application does

795
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
during the kickoff and schedule time for

796
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,000
walkthroughs

797
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
of things like monitoring and alerting

798
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
systems

799
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
including appropriate technical subject

800
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,600
matters so that the auditors can see

801
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,399
how you have implemented your controls

802
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,159
also note that you'll need a way to

803
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,200
track your status

804
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,320
internally i'm a big fan of syncing

805
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,960
every evidence request into the

806
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
company's

807
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,440
jira and then tracking evidence within

808
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,760
there

809
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
closed uploading his attachments and

810
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,200
closing the jira ticket and we believe

811
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,679
that the control has been satisfied

812
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,120
but note that you should use your own

813
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,799
system whatever works with how you

814
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,840
usually work

815
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,440
at the end of the audit you'll receive a

816
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,679
report with your audit result

817
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,080
with luck this will be an unqualified

818
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
opinion

819
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
and state that the firm was able to

820
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,360
verify

821
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,919
that all of your controls operated

822
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,720
across

823
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
all of the samples that they checked

824
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
throughout the entire period

825
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,799
it is possible however that the control

826
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
or that's report will note that some

827
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,559
controls did not operate

828
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
in a tiny startup for instance it's

829
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
possible to have a note saying that for

830
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
example

831
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
off-boarding controls did not operate

832
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
and that might simply be because no one

833
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,240
left the company

834
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,760
during the audit period this sort of

835
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,320
control did not operate is fine you

836
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,880
don't want

837
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
too too many of them but people will

838
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,039
understand that especially a small

839
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:53,600
company

840
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
people may not join with the company and

841
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
people may not switch roles

842
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,960
however if you are not able to provide

843
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,559
evidence of a particular control

844
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,640
operating for the full period

845
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,320
you may receive an exception on that

846
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
control for example

847
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
if we have that ci cd pipeline that only

848
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,000
retains two weeks worth

849
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,240
of logs and we had a year-long audit

850
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,200
period

851
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
you may find that the audit firm has put

852
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
an exception in the report

853
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,720
explaining they could not verify that

854
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
all releases during the year

855
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,559
were verified by automated tests before

856
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,640
being released to production

857
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,559
if you don't have the logs anymore the

858
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
audit firm cannot just take your word

859
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
for it

860
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,840
so qualified disclaimer or adverse

861
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,880
opinions

862
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,559
mean that the audit firm is not able to

863
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,159
verify that your control is operated

864
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
during the test period

865
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,240
and essentially are feeling opinions in

866
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
the case of a sock 2 type 1

867
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,919
it is highly unlikely you would get one

868
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,919
of these the audit firm will instead

869
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,279
work with you

870
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,600
on implementing each of the control set

871
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
until you have a full control set

872
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,480
that is adequate to fulfill the tsps

873
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,279
however

874
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,600
in a sock 2 type 2 with a defined time

875
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
period

876
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
you must be able to show to the audit

877
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,919
firm that every control

878
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,440
operated across every item in your

879
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,399
environment throughout the entire period

880
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
if you receive a qualified disclaimer or

881
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,520
adverse opinion

882
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
you need to work at the audit firm

883
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
understand what caused the failure and

884
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,840
how best to correct the gas for the next

885
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
audit

886
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,360
so after your first successful type 1

887
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,320
audit

888
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,960
you'll want to roll into a test period

889
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
that would conclude with your first type

890
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,039
2

891
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,080
audit and after each type 2 audit

892
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,240
you should begin another test period to

893
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,000
end with your next annual type 2 audit

894
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,039
at the end of each audit however you

895
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,480
should sit down with everyone involved

896
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,440
in your program

897
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,679
and discuss what went well and where you

898
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,679
can improve your processes

899
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,440
it's possible that your auditor may

900
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
provide suggestions for better ways to

901
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,320
generate evidence or improvements in

902
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,919
your procedures

903
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,399
flagging opportunities for automation or

904
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,159
fine-tuning your processes will make

905
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:04,799
each

906
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
next audit cycle go much easier

907
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,559
at the same time an audit firm will

908
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,760
often accept

909
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,480
expect to see some growth maturity of

910
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,159
your processes

911
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,919
you may receive recommendations from the

912
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,159
audit firm about tweets you can make in

913
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,360
areas for growth

914
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
you want to take these under

915
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,120
consideration particularly areas like

916
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
risk management

917
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,080
where you can show that you have a more

918
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,240
sophisticated understanding of the risks

919
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,640
facing your business and better ways to

920
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,480
implement compensating controls

921
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,799
and to address them year after year

922
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,320
and so we've now covered the basics of a

923
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,840
soc2 audit

924
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,279
hopefully this information has set your

925
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,200
security program up for a successful

926
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,720
social prep

927
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,360
and audit i'm happy to answer questions

928
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,000
in our q

929
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,880
a period or come by our discord please

930
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,440
tweet me

931
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,080
at 1dck and i will have these slides up

932
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,919
so that you can grab things like the url

933
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,159
to the trust services criteria

934
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,000
later thank you all right

935
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
dive in i will

936
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
uh i have the discord absence so if you

937
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
guys are not hearing me please yell

938
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,559
loudly

939
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,159
in discord i would say that

940
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,039
the question about can a company use the

941
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,039
controls to define the scope of the sock

942
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,559
2 report

943
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,200
is a great question one of the first

944
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,039
things that we like to talk about

945
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,559
with people is whether you want to

946
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,399
restrict your scope just to your cloud

947
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,440
environment

948
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,799
or whether you're also going to include

949
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,320
your user laptops and your office and so

950
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,880
forth

951
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,799
and so obviously if you start bringing

952
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,960
in physical security controls

953
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
um that does change the scope of it here

954
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
if you're restricted to the cloud

955
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
environment the physical security

956
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
controls are basically all inherited

957
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,600
from aws or from gcp

958
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,159
wherever you guys are running as soon as

959
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,279
we start talking about

960
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,679
cameras and so forth in the office that

961
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,960
becomes in scope

962
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
and one of the things i like to tell

963
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,159
people is sure we could restrict it just

964
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,279
to your cloud environment

965
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,440
but if you have confidential customer

966
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
information on your user laptops or

967
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,200
people are doing things on the mobile

968
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,000
devices

969
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,760
those need to be in scope because really

970
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,519
people are concerned about getting your

971
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
sock to report and finding out are you

972
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,880
going to protect my information

973
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
and so if we have a ton of customer data

974
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,320
on user laptops but it's not in scope

975
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,159
then that can be an issue and that

976
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,240
actually is something if i see

977
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
a report from a company that is just

978
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,399
restricted to

979
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,000
the cloud environment i'm going to look

980
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
for data classification so the controls

981
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
that says that you can't put customer

982
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,240
data

983
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
on user laptops and if not i'm going to

984
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
follow up with them with questions

985
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,919
um so yes that is sort of one way that

986
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,440
you can use controls to define the scope

987
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,640
of your report that's one of the

988
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
questions you should

989
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,080
uh address with your audit team you know

990
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,679
this is what we'd like this scope to be

991
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,120
and so let's make sure that the controls

992
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,080
meet it

993
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
um i would say there was also a question

994
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,919
that went blind before we dive in

995
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:58,960
because there's so

996
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
decaf has a fun point which is saying

997
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,080
hey does that mean that we should think

998
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
about scope as

999
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,640
following where the data goes yeah if

1000
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,639
you're beating the spirit of the sock

1001
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,520
too

1002
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,119
which i'm going to understand i hate to

1003
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,719
say this when people play compliance

1004
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,079
games very much

1005
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,639
and people play scope games a lot if

1006
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,480
they're following this correctly then

1007
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,119
yes

1008
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,679
um you should think in terms of anything

1009
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,679
that has the customer confidential data

1010
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,119
which is what we care about protecting

1011
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,719
from most of the software reports when

1012
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,280
we're talking about a cloud sas

1013
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,560
that yes there should be controls that

1014
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,839
cover everything in there and they

1015
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,199
should have a very strong data

1016
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,359
classification policy that says

1017
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,079
you know customer pii is this particular

1018
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,520
level some of our ip

1019
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,079
is this other less sensitive level um

1020
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,440
you know and there are controls that

1021
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
address where each one of them can go

1022
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
and controls that say how you secure the

1023
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,679
data on each of those places

1024
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,079
like that jim chimes in that says data

1025
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,599
mapping is now actually one of those

1026
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,800
controls

1027
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
yeah yeah you pretty much are going to

1028
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,240
have a very hard time trying to do a

1029
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,800
sock too without a data classification

1030
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,880
i think providing architecture diagrams

1031
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,320
and so forth to the auto team they will

1032
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,400
want to see how that flow goes

1033
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,160
the answer just can't be it goes

1034
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
everywhere

1035
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
uh you're going to have an extremely

1036
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
difficult time doing a sock 2 with a

1037
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,520
reputable audit firm with that kind of

1038
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
answer

1039
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,920
yeah so wendy that actually gets to one

1040
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
of the questions that

1041
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,599
someone raised earlier which is hey what

1042
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,440
do i look for

1043
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,359
when i'm sort of poking around to say

1044
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,960
this and and i guess there are two ways

1045
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,000
right let's let's answer

1046
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
the if i want to actually show i'm

1047
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,280
secure

1048
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
and and then maybe you could give us

1049
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,240
the uh venal bad answer which is

1050
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
what do i look for if i just want to

1051
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
pass

1052
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,359
if you just want to pass oh man so let's

1053
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,640
answer the correct one first

1054
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,040
um you should talk to the auditors when

1055
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
you're interviewing them

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,680
and make sure uh since we're talking

1057
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,200
about cloud sasses and so forth if they

1058
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,520
even understand what aws is and what gcp

1059
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,720
is there's a lot of auditors have been

1060
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
out there are much more used to

1061
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,839
um you know data centers um sort of the

1062
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
90s architecture and so forth and

1063
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,480
they're probably

1064
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
great auditors but for that sort of

1065
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,400
environment and so we want to make sure

1066
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
they understand our technology

1067
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,960
and looking at around the audit firm's

1068
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,599
website

1069
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,680
do their auditors have certifications

1070
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
and of course you know certifications

1071
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
do not mean everything but they can be a

1072
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,960
little bit of a ground for looking to

1073
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,640
see if the auditor's gone

1074
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
um and published you know talks or

1075
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,560
written blog posts or stuff that

1076
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,200
sounds credible and also um if you're

1077
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
doing vendor security reviews

1078
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,880
for companies a lot of times you are

1079
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,240
seeing a lot of sock chews come

1080
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,880
in and i sometimes make note of like hey

1081
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,040
you know the intro to the sock to report

1082
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
sounds pretty good the notes

1083
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
um and the controls here sound like the

1084
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
auditor understands what's going on and

1085
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,119
like okay

1086
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
audit firm probably has at least a

1087
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
little bit of a clue um

1088
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,480
on it and so you sort of get used to

1089
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,920
audit firms that

1090
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,520
you know are pretty good in the cod area

1091
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
if you just want to scrape by and pass

1092
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
um you want auditors where

1093
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,800
basically i hate to say this but if an

1094
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
auditor doesn't understand the

1095
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
technology it's sometimes easier to push

1096
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,720
over uh things too

1097
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
it's happening behind the magic screen

1098
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
here don't dig in too deeply

1099
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
um you know go for the ones where if you

1100
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,359
say

1101
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
we use blockchain they'll be like oh

1102
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,280
that's good yeah

1103
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,520
yeah um i hate to say but i've had

1104
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,040
arguments with auditors about

1105
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,200
why i don't have av in my lambdas and

1106
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
i'm like i

1107
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
let me sit down and attempt to explain

1108
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
to you how why it's super

1109
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,200
unlikely to have malware sitting in my

1110
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,880
lambdas and talk about why that's a

1111
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,480
really dumb thing to be asking me

1112
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,839
like you know what's level set and

1113
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,280
what's going on here um and that's

1114
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
happened with auditors who

1115
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
are pretty up on aws but maybe not all

1116
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,320
of the newest stuff

1117
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,560
fun is there a question that you had in

1118
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,720
mind or we can we can there was

1119
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,960
the uh one that was asked a little bit

1120
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
ago about is there a typical set of

1121
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,240
controls available for a small startup

1122
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,200
or do you have to start with the

1123
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
controls provided by the auditor and

1124
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
then customize from there

1125
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
um a lot of times if you don't have any

1126
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,880
controls at all the auditor

1127
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,800
should be able to come in and give you a

1128
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,640
fairly good set of controls some of them

1129
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,480
are more flexible than others about how

1130
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
much modification they will allow

1131
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,560
some of them a lot of times due to the

1132
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,160
nature of how they run their audits and

1133
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,359
how they collect their evidence

1134
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,079
really uh struggled to change the

1135
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,520
control set um and

1136
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,119
my advice is if you're a small startup

1137
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,960
that runs on aws

1138
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
unless that is a really good control set

1139
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,640
for that you may want to stay away from

1140
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,680
working with them just because it's

1141
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
gonna be a lot of struggle for you

1142
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,880
as a company as a need to suck too um

1143
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
but yeah so i really don't want to come

1144
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,520
in and be like well i'm a consultant and

1145
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,040
i can do this um i have a set of

1146
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,720
controls that i often start with with a

1147
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,599
company but then i

1148
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,359
interview them and talk about like okay

1149
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,800
how are you actually doing this and so

1150
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,160
you can also do the same thing you can

1151
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,440
sit down like okay

1152
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,720
i'm going to look at the trust services

1153
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
criteria that says that i need to secure

1154
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,480
access to customer data how are we doing

1155
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,560
this how are we gaining access into aws

1156
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,000
well let's write a control to say what

1157
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
we do and you don't need to worry about

1158
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,640
perfectly refining that control that is

1159
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
something the auditor can work with you

1160
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,040
if you say

1161
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,079
we use multi-factor and you need to

1162
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,280
assume a security role within aws or we

1163
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
you know use multi-factor and gcp the

1164
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,760
auditor can help you sort of clean that

1165
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,560
up to be

1166
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,960
the appropriate language for it and one

1167
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,160
of the things that

1168
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,440
people sometimes get stumped about with

1169
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
sock 2 when they start it is that

1170
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,400
there's essentially a many-to-many

1171
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,599
relationship

1172
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,280
one control can fulfill many trust

1173
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,880
services principles

1174
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,280
and also you have many controls that

1175
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,640
fulfill a signal trust services

1176
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,839
principles it's not like you need to

1177
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,359
write one mega control

1178
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,839
to meet a trust services principle

1179
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,440
you're going to be fulfilling different

1180
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
aspects of different controls

1181
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
and so that many to many could be a

1182
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
little weird when you start out

1183
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,800
but that is essentially how you know we

1184
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,320
work with folks to

1185
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
meet it we're basically trying to

1186
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
capture what their processes actually

1187
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:53,839
are

1188
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,119
and obviously there's gaps in those

1189
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,040
processes if we say okay

1190
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,119
you know you have all these really great

1191
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,119
controls for aws but you also allow

1192
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,960
people to put data on your endpoints so

1193
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
we need to talk about your laptop

1194
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,680
controls let's talk about how you're

1195
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,359
ensuring that people are updating the

1196
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,800
software on there

1197
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,880
and requiring file vault for bitlocker

1198
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,839
and so forth

1199
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,200
and an auditor can do the same thing

1200
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
they can catch those gaps and work with

1201
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,640
you to address them

1202
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,160
yeah i like that well are there

1203
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,839
other questions

1204
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
i really like jim's about using grc

1205
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,599
platforms to manage stock 2 and

1206
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,040
compliance frameworks

1207
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
i got to be honest i use jira

1208
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
extensively

1209
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,040
there's a jira plug-in called recurring

1210
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,800
tasks that you can buy in the jira

1211
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,319
marketplace and it allows you to set up

1212
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,000
templates and it will fire as often as

1213
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,040
you tell them so

1214
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
i run access control reviews through

1215
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,400
that i run a lot of internal audit

1216
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
through that like you have an annual one

1217
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
that will fire to do

1218
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,880
go schedule our pen test and annual and

1219
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,960
a few months later to make sure that

1220
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,119
we have tracked things that came out of

1221
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,520
the pen test and we're addressing them

1222
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
and then also google sheets i don't use

1223
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
a lot of custom grc software

1224
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
mostly because i work with startups that

1225
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,400
are already usually paying for google

1226
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,880
docs

1227
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,240
and i don't want to be like oh you need

1228
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,760
to go buy this thirty thousand dollar

1229
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,480
tool

1230
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,880
um i do risk registers in uh google

1231
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,079
sheets most of the time

1232
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,760
or within jira and those tools um can be

1233
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,359
flexed especially things like jira

1234
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,800
recurring task plug-in

1235
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,760
in order to meet most of the needs for a

1236
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,240
small

1237
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,000
company doing this talk to you obviously

1238
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
if you're a really big huge enterprise

1239
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
and you're also doing photographs and so

1240
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,839
forth

1241
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,119
you're in a whole another level of

1242
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,520
maturity and you probably already have

1243
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,480
uh grc platforms in place which you know

1244
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,240
would that make sense to do that

1245
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,839
yeah cool so you

1246
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,040
talked about uh sort of automation

1247
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,640
and how that could scale are there

1248
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,560
things that you see are there

1249
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,640
new tools coming on the marketplace or

1250
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,400
even the open source that you think are

1251
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,920
really exciting

1252
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
um oh well that's a good question uh

1253
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,160
dependable has made our lives so so so

1254
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,599
much easier on the vulnerability

1255
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,200
managing thing

1256
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,440
if we set up branch protection within

1257
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,119
github and we set up kendabot and

1258
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,240
whatever

1259
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,480
those two things alone can get rid of a

1260
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,000
lot of problems that we've had

1261
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
in the past and making sure that all the

1262
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,079
changes that get merged in

1263
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,079
have been reviewed and making sure that

1264
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,520
we're on top of getting

1265
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,480
uh patches fixed uh some other kind of

1266
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,119
automation

1267
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,599
um the jira recurring task is one of my

1268
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,200
favorite things i've seen people do

1269
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,920
stuff with

1270
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,280
uh you know scripting against the octa

1271
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,440
api and so forth

1272
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,200
some of that usually i will provide

1273
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,760
advice on like hey i see us struggling

1274
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,680
in the sock 2 every year for this

1275
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,839
particular thing like you're

1276
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,000
um do you have sres or other folks who

1277
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,079
are able to go in and do it

1278
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,400
as a consultant i often don't end up

1279
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,560
writing it myself

1280
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,119
for them but definitely doing code

1281
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,599
reviews

1282
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,160
on things and so forth to make sure that

1283
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,680
you know whatever we put in place is not

1284
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
too brittle

1285
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,280
fun and yeah and i'd like your super

1286
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
well i'd like your approach and say hey

1287
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,440
you know it's often

1288
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,920
google docs is going to help us as well

1289
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,720
yeah

1290
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,920
yeah uh flagging uh your

1291
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,839
gaps with different conditional

1292
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,280
formatting and things

1293
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
just those very simple things will go a

1294
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,640
very long way to help you

1295
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
sort of see at a glance what your status

1296
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,319
is for these and for me that's really

1297
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,520
important because a lot of times i'm

1298
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,319
running

1299
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,319
uh three or four different sock two

1300
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,200
audits at the same time

1301
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
and so there's a lot to sort of track

1302
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
through there

1303
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,839
uh so let's see um there's a question

1304
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,680
about how do you get your auditors

1305
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,280
comfortable with ci cd

1306
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,760
uh if you're looking for right if your

1307
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,359
auditors are a little more classic big

1308
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,800
industry

1309
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,000
how do you sort of help them understand

1310
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,920
that they want to see that

1311
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,560
a lot of times it's getting the sres or

1312
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,920
other engineers in there who have

1313
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,200
written

1314
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,280
the tests and we talk about you know

1315
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,040
here's what the gates are we don't

1316
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
deploy until certain tests go

1317
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,920
some folks still are using ci cd but

1318
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,560
they

1319
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,720
hold things at you know maybe a five

1320
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,400
percent deploy to a canary and then

1321
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,040
require

1322
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,800
someone just use a slack bot or

1323
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,480
something to approve it to go beyond

1324
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,960
that

1325
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,240
and so if you have auditors who are

1326
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,839
really uncomfortable with things you can

1327
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,280
do that sort of

1328
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,400
uh last gate to push things out

1329
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,960
um but yeah they're usually once we talk

1330
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,839
through like

1331
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,520
uh here's the checks that we're doing

1332
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,960
and it's not just you know a bunch of

1333
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,160
really stupid print

1334
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,520
out uh within the test it works i

1335
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,920
remember there was a recruiting ad for a

1336
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,359
giant tech company

1337
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,599
maybe 10 years ago and it was someone

1338
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:34,960
saying i've only been here three weeks

1339
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,720
i'm already pushing code i'm like

1340
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,040
i don't know if that's a good thing it

1341
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,240
is a good thing though

1342
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
that means that you have really strong

1343
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,920
unit tests and you have a really mature

1344
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,880
framework um

1345
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,480
and you're rolling out to canary and

1346
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,000
making sure errors aren't spiking and

1347
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,359
then approving your release to go out

1348
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,240
further

1349
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,720
yeah so that's a very important sign i

1350
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,160
love it that's fantastic

1351
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,440
so uh we only have a few more minutes

1352
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
and when i wanted to you could speculate

1353
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
you know this isn't necessarily heavy

1354
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,119
aware but

1355
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
as you look towards the future of this

1356
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
kind of compliance regime

1357
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,720
what are some of the things that you

1358
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
think maybe aren't going to be

1359
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,119
in the certification today but you have

1360
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,240
a hunch we're going to

1361
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,599
need to think about in the future um

1362
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,200
let's see i have not yet had any

1363
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,880
auditors asking me about s-bomb and i

1364
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,000
think that that's really something

1365
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,960
that's kind of

1366
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,720
important coming up um yes

1367
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
yeah i mean i would really love to see

1368
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,720
auditors just getting more comfortable

1369
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
with understanding what security groups

1370
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,880
are and working with the tools that

1371
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
azure and so forth make available aws

1372
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,240
and azure have a ton of really great

1373
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,960
compliance tools available and so

1374
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,119
maybe making it easier for those to

1375
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,720
connect directly to

1376
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,720
audit firm evidence collection things so

1377
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,079
i don't have to do the manual seeking

1378
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,040
between them

1379
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,800
excellent well wendy one of the things

1380
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,000
i'm always blown away by all your

1381
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,440
presentations you take things that are

1382
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
sort of dry and obscure and legal

1383
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,880
and make them not only accessible but

1384
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,480
really interesting so

1385
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,640
thank you so much for doing that again

1386
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,839
uh you're just gonna have to work to

1387
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,839
find more boring topics to get us all

1388
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,200
really excited about because i know a

1389
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,960
lot of us are now more excited about

1390
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,440
sock too well thank you so much

1391
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,440
