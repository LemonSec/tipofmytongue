00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,080
what also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them is that not all of</font>

33
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,020
them are saying this much difference

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,020
like there are many desk affiliates like

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,030
debian google do slackware our clinics

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,140
and many of them so why can't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of thing in security so that's</font>

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:24,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we started and we just follow the</font>

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,310
free spirit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux to do that and</font>

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:32,380
three years back or four years back I

41
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,690
know nothing of UNIX even to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,079
in my computerized to take days or

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,790
someone's help to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,600
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a good way to learn</font>

45
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:48,609
linux and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,480
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were some issues with only</font>

47
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:55,540
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> disposed there and they need</font>

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,600
some manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that to</font>

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,630
actually get them working so just to

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,090
walk on them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made it pretty easy to</font>

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,829
get put it up and just start winning

52
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,650
your applications of tools for your

53
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:15,299
security scanning or framework or

54
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:18,690
anything so and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one and</font>

55
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:22,239
initially it was started just so that

56
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,570
you know to meet our needs and just to

57
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,190
have a pillow on my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> mag image</font>

58
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,519
computer to just work can I do

59
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,660
occasions and packages that we needed

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:39,260
but then it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got popular so we have</font>

61
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a persuasive distribution so</font>

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,429
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the challenges we</font>

63
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,540
finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> I usually be standing up in</font>

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,990
slacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> then / having some limitations</font>

65
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,810
because a linux distro move for<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

66
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">initiative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly needs to be you know</font>

67
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't apply or to a flash drive and</font>

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
if you go to flag it takes a lot of

69
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,790
times to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put up after people to head</font>

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so and then you switch to voodoo</font>

71
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:16,560
and we work with three millions of bits

72
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:20,880
of poop and right now the last version

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,290
was based on debian and the next one is

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,570
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> every between debian and slaps</font>

75
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,870
it's mostly a debian look alike and then

76
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,680
feel the kernel level and some of the

77
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:39,030
stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly /y emphasize on slacks</font>

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,669
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> slacks the comfort my sister</font>

79
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,780
compression is too high if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

80
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> google to or ubuntu basic estimate</font>

81
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,750
for your desktop and if you look at the

82
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">slack better iphone is there's a google</font>

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">who comes with a 700 mb m is or a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slash</font>

84
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,119
comes with the same set of tools and

85
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications you need for your desktop</font>

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,110
in 350 or 300 mb so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:10,169
difference there so when you come to a

88
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,040
little security<font color="#CCCCCC"> room you mostly want to</font>

89
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:17,370
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be booted from a flashlight</font>

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:20,520
from your wrist so you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as</font>

91
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,390
small as you can so that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

92
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,799
different plans

93
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:29,849
we do games three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years so he would</font>

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be better knew how a bill that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

95
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,130
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in a one gig or do we so that's</font>

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason kind of like we started with</font>

97
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:42,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and initially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I wasn't really</font>

98
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,119
like experience with lyrics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,580
say that and there are issues with

100
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,850
collaborating with different application

101
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:57,419
developers and others and we like the

102
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,810
infrastructure forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> anita and the</font>

103
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,580
legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues because you know don't</font>

104
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,010
about exploit development<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

105
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:12,599
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the financial</font>

106
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:17,190
issue so it was launched in 2008 based

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:20,340
on slacks like i said and two variants

108
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:25,100
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fubu do but when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really picked up</font>

109
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:27,599
was when we moved to debian in 2011 and

110
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,900
matrix was the first one to be based on

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,820
debian all the other linux distros which

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,580
were in the security and forensics where

113
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,688
most people

114
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:41,318
by the time and we pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continue</font>

115
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:44,590
the sticking with debian for a long time

116
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,169
and looked at who stick that stick to

117
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,210
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good when</font>

118
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:55,000
you're considering build up stuff and

119
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:59,739
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it get them together so</font>

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,409
push it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> Demetri exits designed to</font>

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,539
we plan to cover most of the group of

<font color="#CCCCCC">back with XZ compression so that you can</font>

compress the file system to a good level

<font color="#E5E5E5">working but the few tests does need to</font>

452
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,300
be done because there there there might

453
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,300
be some hardware issues that might come

454
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,960
up later on when we release there might

455
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,889
be issues with some computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> this won't</font>

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wireless drivers in the colonel</font>

464
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:15,310
so no one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to you know get it</font>

465
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:21,270
installed on UTS can then work through

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mangoes for the barges cars and</font>

467
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:26,020
there are some other projects we are

468
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:32,320
working on like the material<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

469
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:35,260
framework yes what is it virtualize

470
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">no.22 TM yes it's right on running</font>

471
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,590
running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> VirtualBox I use virtualbox</font>

472
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,900
to develop so that every time I can take

473
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:48,600
a snapshot and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something breaks up I</font>

474
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,600
can just sit back there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

475
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:56,550
integrated with virtualbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right</font>

476
00:29:51,700 --> 00:30:01,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">now this version is running in life I</font>

477
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:03,399
just I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it as life sweetie and</font>

478
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,120
running but if you see pretty much

479
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualbox it's just going</font>

480
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,830
easy with that because if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

481
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:16,300
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux distribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a</font>

482
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,340
VMware virtual box you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get it</font>

483
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,950
installed and then have the guest

484
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">additions sort of the separate packages</font>

485
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:27,040
that you have for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be installed</font>

486
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,010
so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much taken care of that</font>

487
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,990
it works easy with the virtual moves and

488
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,990
VMware you see

489
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:44,439
this and I so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes also what you</font>

490
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:50,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">say github repository we didn't upload a</font>

491
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:52,899

ticket when I was even soul food

493
00:30:52,899 --> 00:31:00,580

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> magic security testing framework</font>

499

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,730
colonel when you're compiling it takes

576
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,589
three or four hours to just compile it

577
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,880

586
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:02,560
sometimes it just takes a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

587
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,680
I mean if I have to go through knowing

592
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,290
it so it just pretty much takes time

593
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:28,560
that it takes for you to install and

sorry

597
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:44,820
that's great Ricky the reason is it's

598
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">tough to even get crazy drivers to run</font>

getting the traffic that was running I

603
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,930
think that's something I look at the end
