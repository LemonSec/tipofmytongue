all right hey everyone welcome to

malware heuristics we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,700
over a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things today we're</font>

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to teach you how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform</font>

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,820
basic android malware analysis I'm gonna

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,070
focus on ATP analysis rent on Charles's

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,930
android apps other than static code

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,660
analysis and how those convicted

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,698
conjunction basically taking from not

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,759
going a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our analysis into</font>

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,260
being able to do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more serious stuff</font>

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matt's going to talk about a deeper</font>

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,399
interesting and then Jimmy is going to

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,899
talk about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool can help but since</font>

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,500
malware analysis and that's actually

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this top so that we</font>

can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take someone it doesn't</font>

have a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience doing</font>

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,940
that and teach them some stuff so I'm

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,400
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a professional malware researcher</font>

39
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,500
not a reverse engineer definitely not an

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,670
Android expert I actually have an iphone

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,490
I don't even have a physical address

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,090
pretty embarrassing and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as ugly</font>

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,110
developing so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's start going to</font>

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,000
begin we're just going to define the

45
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,530
problem of mobile malware because it's

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a little bit different than</font>

47
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,460
conventional now we're a couple

48
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,200
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways so the big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of text</font>

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about that we're going to</font>

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">find malicious software as any software</font>

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,210
that you through the abuse of granted

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,339
permissions or the in traditional

53
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,740
exploitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> conduct activity that may</font>

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,300
be considered malicious or mishandled or

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,610
maybe said when programmatically

56
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,320
permissions abuse or exploitation or

57
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,940
security this configuration needles

58
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,250
something that we would say is malicious

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,900
in some play now the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

60
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,700
different than conventional now where is

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if we have say an app that reads</font>

62
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,480
through your address book uploads all

63
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">their contacts is some over to the</font>

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">alternative to some arbitrary server and</font>

65
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,089
then periodically stems blast out text

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all of in contacts anyway we</font>

67
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the colors community with my new</font>

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,430
bikini pictures you know when we

69
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,380
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that validates give this</font>

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,910
propagating so now conventionally we put

71
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,650
this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much exactly with the</font>

72
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">melissa understood back to the day</font>

73
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,700
example female

74
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,160
text messages so we'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

75
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,810
propagating itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Excalibur but we</font>

76
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't say that it's a social network</font>

77
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,920
that has 10 million users and yes we

78
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,170
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out but it's</font>

79
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,700
the most recent example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of okay well</font>

80
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,559
when given this<font color="#E5E5E5"> app permissions we think</font>

81
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,940
it's something that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,500
actually using those permissions that is

83
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,840
you know texting the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone book</font>

84
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,300
at 6am are doing something he would say

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">is bad and the way that it can do this</font>

86
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,510
is that it's amusing permissions that

87
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,369
you've actually given it you saying yeah

88
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,019
you can read my contacts EIU<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside up</font>

89
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,910
text me I you do all this for maybe

90
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,470
somewhat legitimate purposes at the time

91
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,109
but it turns out that it's actually

92
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,090
abusing those provisions so we have a

93
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,100
screenshot of a town that has all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

94
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,650
these provisions it can access your

95
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,790
personal information it can send text

96
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,860
messages protect which is actually

97
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,720
labeled as services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs you money</font>

98
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm an access to find you guessed</font>

99
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,830
location it can delete things on your

100
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,569
USB storage you can basically do

101
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,180
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and traditionally we need to</font>

102
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,500
actually exploit a device for an

103
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,920
operating system to get these

104
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,930
permissions but as we found out to say

105
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,280
ssl problems users will generally just

106
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,620
click yes unless they see something

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,820
that's really a big red flag so since

108
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,470
everything's sort of a social number of

109
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">these days so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that internet</font>

110
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,989

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,760

112
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,299
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that really it probably</font>

113
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,679
should be good so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that</font>

114
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are different permissions</font>

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,090
hip used we need to basically find even

116
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,319
a haze 2 X we<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you know up about a</font>

117
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,569
million apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than that now</font>

118
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,399
currently on the Google Play Store which

119
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:09,230
is a lot you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that many of</font>

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,750
those apps legitimately need the

121
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,578
permissions that they request so where

122
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,980
do we start how can we begin this first

123
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,870
days of analysis will generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck the</font>

124
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,120
really big list of apt capes and in

125
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,380
order to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with AK analysis we need</font>

126
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,259
to understand a little bit about how

127
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,539
many cakes children basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's as if</font>

on it contains a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

129
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,919
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app itself and it can easily</font>

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,110
be manipulated and red which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of</font>

course pretty helpful in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

132
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,530
we're going to talk about inferred

133

manifesto XML which is basically an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

specifically than that plus permission

138

pretty easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that using a</font>

you can run it pretty much anywhere

bring it down into its components and

00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,569
also basically we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it as</font>

long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as if on steroids also knowing that</font>

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,498
the net afterwards so for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> element</font>

directories in compiled apks from there

194
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:43,399
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually say for each element in</font>

about will be used for our original

202
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,870
sample size and then now we know okay

203
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">which ones are using these permissions</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if you looking for</font>

reasoning behind this is the in

Cantonese permissions that are Atlantic

and can't grant permissions that they

don't ask for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain point soon</font>

opportunity that more closely which is

215
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,000
really helping when you're trying to do

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,710
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a broad spectrum now we're analysis</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they shouldn't be as a side note this</font>

think it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take your contact</font>

list and shoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up somewhere plain</font>

or does in the background that you

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,700

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shortlist we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually move into</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time so the Android SDK</font>

232
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,140
comes with an emulator which is great

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,039
don't need to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our devices basically</font>

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,500
designed so that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're writing</font>

244
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,780
then perform analysis on that so you can

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,460
see here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> running with just the TCP</font>

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,590
actually comes out pcap you can then use

AED to install this case we did

249
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,460
Instagram 106 and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty interesting that you know we know</font>

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,250
once the PDF is created you can actually

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">even want more standard set of tools</font>

268
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,180
like for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> TC ito so here you can</font>

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running to speed up and</font>

reading from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file we just created</font>

271
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're saying that the source is the</font>

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">android device and the destination that</font>

and using awk and exhort you need to say

276
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,950
we went a list of unique combinations of

277
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,459
remote coast and we're all protocols in

278
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,189
the time

279
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,709
laxatives so we came out with a couple

of easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers a couple of Google</font>

284
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,959
but some now where you'll see about why

is connecting to you know 18 host<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

China why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know connecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

287
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:47,019
arbitrators every minute what's

288
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,269
happening is it doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird</font>

289
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,100
now at this stage we didn't see that but

290
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,910
this is the first layer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

291
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,319
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like you're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running if</font>

292
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,969
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a little bit of red X here and</font>

293
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:00,889
yeah I know that's not super human

294
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,509
readable basically what I'm trying to do

295
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:03,679
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is get a protocol count so I'm</font>

296
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,910
saying for each of the request name

297
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,309
during this probably got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-minute</font>

298
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,040
theory that I was testing what protocols

299
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:12,949
are being used to connect to remote host

300
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,079
we came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're 15 HP</font>

301
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">here it was condoms for 32 they should</font>

302
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:19,189
be s request and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then now I'm going to</font>

303
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,600
hear it was ok so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

304
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,670
standard traffic analysis you'll

305
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,649
probably notice the problem here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

306
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,479
have you know this packet capture but

307
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:29,420
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you really do with it when in</font>

308
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,129
this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> 97</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wentworth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> presented</font>

309
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,559
the requests are our ssl encrypted

310
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:35,119
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great big proponent</font>

311
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,399
crypto but for the same reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

312
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:40,519
can't read your you know SSH tunnel it

313
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,649
right here at these sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also can't</font>

314
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,720
see if these requests are sending

315
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,879
sensitive data or they're just you know

316
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,759
updating or checking for news or

317
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,379
whatever so we're going to do that we

318
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,819
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some ssl interception and</font>

319
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,679
android doesn't play along in the same

320
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,389
way that it does with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp temerity to be</font>

321
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,860
unplugged it's basically becomes

322
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,660
irrelevant once you notice that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

323
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,179
traffic's all encrypted only goes to

324
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,959
property for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

325
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:05,150
noise

326
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,700
to be encrypted we think that malware

327
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,500
authors do that do the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

328
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,970
first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the easiest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is going</font>

329
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be plain text sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get a</font>

330
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,610
hit there but overall not so good for

331
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,810
that and as long as ta is<font color="#E5E5E5"> infeasible for</font>

332
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,610
quick analysis because again we're

333
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,750
trying to do this iterative process but

334
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,780
we look into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit later</font>

335
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,250
what we can do is basically use DNS

336
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,290
redirection in combination with an

337
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">interception proxy to sort of cool the</font>

338
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android devices of thinking that it has</font>

339
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,069
a valid SS officer what it does it so

340
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,720
there's a tool to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this open</font>

341
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,970
source it's called Android proxy then

342
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,280
cross-platform it's only requirement is

343
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,520
the twisted library and it basically

344
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,860
uses dns to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow ssl ssl</font>

345
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,810
interception so taken from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the google</font>

346
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,670
project page you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">emulator is basically making a DNS</font>

oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this you know one</font>

352
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,750
del-one it up what about three then when

353
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,370
the emulators the net request it's

354
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,080
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connection to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> edit</font>

or something proxy which both in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

356
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,910

357
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">where up sweet so doing that we've</font>

358
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,750
basically run the another again all

359
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,770
these commands will be online point the

360
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,860
HTTP proxy flag to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android proxy</font>

361
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,110
as well as specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the local</font>

362
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,340
Esther ever obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to turn on</font>

363
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,290
any other DNS server you may have

364
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,150
running and then burp suite or another

365
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,660
interception proxy listening on

366
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,819
localhost ka so from here you can see

367
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an encrypted ocular con su shun</font>

368

for ponies they're small<font color="#E5E5E5"> courses that</font>

369
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and you know it's great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that</font>

370
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,260
works we can see Android<font color="#E5E5E5"> props in the</font>

371
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,450
background actually rewriting those DNS

372
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,160
requests and then connect request 42 the

373
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,830
intercepting proxy which yields

374
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,959
basically in the end you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see oh well</font>

375
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,360
there's were reading my I<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted</font>

connection or allegedly encrypted

connection here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem because</font>

378
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,480
that sounds great it often possible

379
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,220
morning like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and says hey</font>

380
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,120
something's wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

381
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,060
continue because i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

382
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,320

383
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,150
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news when you see this</font>

can continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit continue you can just</font>

386
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,810
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's mine it'll actually</font>

387
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,130
let you do that here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem when</font>

388
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,500
we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about are suspicious</font>

389
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,240
permissions earlier we noted you know

390
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,380
running a background process but

391
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever process is running in the</font>

392
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,680

393
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,450
you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> choice of doing this you know</font>

394
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,189
maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your analysis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you click</font>

395
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,780
continue a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you don't notice</font>

396
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,480
anything strange being pretty sure that

397
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,860
the app is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something suspicious</font>

398
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,910
how do you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out or even if</font>

399
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,250
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect it is running a</font>

400
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,740
background process well from there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

401
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,670
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets a little bit more tricky and you</font>

402
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,510
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install your own</font>

403
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:50,180
ssl certificate so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> google store</font>

404
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,670
helps us out and get backhanded way by

405
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,099
having the neg st garden and we can

406
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,680
basically create an image file for an SD

407
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,440
card mounted with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> st car can</font>

408
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,959
add and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then use adb to push the search</font>

409
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,180
on to the phone then install it manually

410
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,250
that persistent post reboots you only

411
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,349
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it once then that works a lot</font>

412
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,660
better you can just run the HTTP proxy

413
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,840
directly to whatever in various ethnic

414
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,589
roxy is again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use we're so close to</font>

415
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,900
80 80 so here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we have the</font>

416
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports originally installed but it's a</font>

417
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,220
little bit it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit alarming</font>

418
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,870
than android does make the different the

419
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,470
differentiation that it is a user

420
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,790
installed sir now so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far we haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

421
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,210
malware or malicious programs that are

422
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,319
declining these are installed sirs but

423
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,890
we're thinking that's probably going to

424
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,000
happen down the road for now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's five</font>

425
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,439
once it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's going to have to</font>

426
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,500
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to actually figuring out a way</font>

427
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,830
to push that into a system installed at

428
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuit even though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

429
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,450
so now we've seen basic runtime analysis

430
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,580
and we're staying on again we're

431
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,630
focusing on the network so what's a

432
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,060
connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> two is it doing anything</font>

433
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,010
suspicious is the track that is sending

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that may be necessary cricket is that is</font>

435
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know is it your contact list is</font>

436
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,280
it you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pictures is that</font>

437
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,680
your passwords is in the contents of

438
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,390
your USB storage device<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is it and</font>

439
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that but it doesn't</font>

440
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">always it doesn't always happen during</font>

441
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time you have</font>

442
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,700

443
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,980
suspicious to from there we're going to

444
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,870
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some brief static code analysis</font>

445
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,959
and keep in mind that this was never you

446
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:27,180
know my specialty<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're looking at</font>

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,709
basically index miles w executables

<font color="#CCCCCC">McBride on the dalvik virtual machine</font>

449
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,930
that's going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in more</font>

450
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,279
significant detail a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes but</font>

451
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,660
the important thing about index files is

452
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,700
easily convertible to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> java drive</font>

453

standard tool suite when are actually

455
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,510
performing back analysis so we can use a

456
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,610
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source tool called esta chart</font>

457
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,180
to basically say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

463
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,959
from here we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> search for</font>

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,819

if an Abigail analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> failed to detect</font>

466
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,589
them so this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful if certain</font>

467
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,930
actions trigger a pre-designated network

468
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,029

471
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,360
because unless you happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get lucky</font>

472
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,130
you're using me the runtime analysis at

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
that particular time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't have</font>

little bit more broad right now we're

491
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:07,350
using JD doing as the name implies to

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,520
just hard coded IP addresses you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look for anything which really</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">our eyes with different things on the</font>

it

section important differentiation

511
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,990
because a lot of false positives that

512
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,790
we've seen are asked but really just

513
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,230
request permissions thinking well you

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it a social network next</font>

00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,430
year we'll just request announce when

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:59,678
that i also have a specialization in x86

567
00:19:53,039 --> 00:20:00,908
system moving forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

568
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,059
jump straight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff talking</font>

569
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:05,769
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> J's file format basically up</font>

570
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,440
here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much the same as the</font>

571
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:13,389
java file format we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looking at</font>

572
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:16,269
headers string<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs anything</font>

573
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:19,769
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew / scream data that's all</font>

574
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:22,239
any that's all the decks model so using

575
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:25,599
using to using this data we can figure

576
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:27,849
out what the xbox actually doing in this

577
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,870
talk I'm most agree focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

578
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:32,300
methods

579
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:38,000
because that will actually tell us what

580
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:39,530
objects are being used so ring don't

581
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,920
work as I said we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

582
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,170
methods here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the package is a package</font>

583
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">name the object name and then the method</font>

584
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,980
name as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see here there are three eyes</font>

585
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:55,040
what does meanwhile does need attributes

586
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,960
so you know each method<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nader's maybe</font>

587
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain open attributes associated with</font>

588
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,990
such and then there will of course be

589
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,790
some type of value again right here is

590
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,360
seen which is going I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

591
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,889
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> next and then we're going</font>

592
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,979
then we have some fields which are

593
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:16,830
basically the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's more</font>

594
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,779
point to the job feels so

595
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:24,879
Retallick so these are all the different

596
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:29,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">types employees millions char's integers</font>

597
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:29,998
what's so on so forth things get

598
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,959
so very first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to</font>

599
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,400
discuss its<font color="#E5E5E5"> color bolt this is this is</font>

600
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,000
probably the first next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

601
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,049
that anyone will look at hopefully so

602
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,950
that you have some type of idea

603
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically creates the object of</font>

604
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,869
color world that's the strength color

605
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,749
world this quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stream is going</font>

606
00:21:53,869 --> 00:22:01,610
to this plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> invokes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack method</font>

607
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:04,730
which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make text objects to see</font>

608
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:08,928
those letters are there but then better

609
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,600
moves that results object into the

610
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:15,549
register be 0 and then invokes the

611
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,580
virtual method which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Legion</font>

612
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:22,080
returns void it didn't actually include

613
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,389
any other invoking code within the

614
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,699
grid taxonomically what happens is it

615
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">invokes the terminal program which</font>

616
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,730
actually shows hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> world has to be</font>

617
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,729
sisters

618
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,020
our samples for more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm just</font>

619
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,899
going to jump straight and talking about

620
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,870
my hour now now that we have some kind

621
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:48,520
of clue of what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file looks like</font>

622
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,520
they're actually analyzing it

623
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,750
the main differences will actually there

624
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:58,449
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> differences now we're for both x86</font>

625
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:01,450
and now we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> domick are both doing</font>

626
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same types of things okay they're</font>

627
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:07,840
mostly else make money and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

628
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are grants and we're all types of</font>

629
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:17,340
stuff that also goes so

630
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,750
it was to steal steal data still data

631
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:26,580
and then send it send it via post more

632
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:30,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON ok so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steelers common all</font>

633
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,250
different types of other types of you

634
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,610
know packages sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC</font>

635
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,840
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a non sometimes sometimes it's</font>

636
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like back-and-forth communication</font>

637
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the server premium service of</font>

638
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,770
users are pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing</font>

639
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:50,070
except this one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to be</font>

640
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,590
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over and then and then just</font>

641
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,168
basically just charging you 250 or

642
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,689
whatever and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that bill is</font>

643
00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:04,590
actually given to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> by whichever</font>

644
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:08,280
provider was so mostly these two these

645
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,110
two types of our usually connected

646
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,879
schooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data and might as well</font>

647
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,879
also numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice for money</font>

648
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,499
permissions so in this particular piece

649
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,000
now when I ate that I analyzed about to

650
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:27,640
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again</font>

651
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,860
it had access to send smss or<font color="#CCCCCC"> CMS MSS</font>

652
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:34,490
write to external storage which is your

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,740
SD card install packages to<font color="#E5E5E5"> repack</font>

654
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,030
yourself upon I mean you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

655
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,120
dealing with something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has full</font>

656
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:46,430
capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun fearful retrievers so</font>

657
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:51,178
and i know i know the recent version of

658
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:55,029
android is it the lease if it doesn't

659
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,210
well it's kind of our thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

660
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:02,279
elevator could actually just recounted

661
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,279
anyway but you can call phones to our

662
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:13,658
contacts dealing so basically what does

663
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:16,419
go does if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it all along the</font>

664
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:18,190
top it does it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> moves next so we</font>

665
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:21,549
know it's going to be moving it's going

666
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looping this code it's going to</font>

667
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">its when you get strings which are which</font>

668
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,950
are actually the contact names and then

669
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,950
it's going to use the string builder to

670
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:38,019
create create phone calling and then

671
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:40,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">number for that and then it's when you</font>

672
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:42,340
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> move that result object to a</font>

673
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,919
string and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to print it out to</font>

674
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,879
our place hot foam to run we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

675
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,880
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second</font>

676
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,190
this is actually where it sends the

677
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:56,009
contacts so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we create the phone</font>

678
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:59,279
book with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contacts at the phone</font>

679
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:01,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">number it's the names now it's going to</font>

680
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the full blow it's going to get the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">CNC server now in this particular piece</font>

actually giving you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the settings it</font>

688

didn't exist anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> so unfortunately we</font>

689
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:30,389
shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down but but as we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

690
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,119
though just remove stack analysis on

691
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:36,658
this one piece of the mountain<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

692
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,249
it is obviously its usage so what they

693
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,409
were going to do is send more

694
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:42,479
configuration data pasta means called

695
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:44,609
more packages to the phone to do other

696
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:47,149
malicious to develop religious

697
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,149
activities

698
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,680
so as soon as we as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we have the</font>

699
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,639
settings in there it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send</font>

700
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:00,560
those contacts via post effective as we

701
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:03,620
can see here and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you</font>

702
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:08,360
know do the it's going to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> that movie</font>

703
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:10,189
objects into into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yard into the</font>

704
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,899
packets and then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

705
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:16,120
response code from the server room and

706
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,120
say disconnect them

this is actually where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

708
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,900
a creation creation of those those SMS

709
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:29,320
is where it actually gives the<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gives a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC server so important</font>

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,429
know horses into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a text message that it</font>

715
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,759
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out repentance all those things</font>

716
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:51,219
to text method

717
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,219
message and since I've extremes

718
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,720
in other pieces now where it had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

719
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,720
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make calls from your phone</font>

720
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,309
this is everywhere you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

721
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,320
seriously pull this from anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

722
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:10,790
net and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody pretty much used is</font>

723
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same same effort to make a call so</font>

724
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:16,070
the funniest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about a lot of malware</font>

725
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:18,830
is that it could simply be a copy base

726
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter it really doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a lot of</font>

727
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,790
skill to build this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

728
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,299
then have people install to their phone

729
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:28,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's people don't very start</font>

730
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:31,100
intuitions

731
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,889
basically this does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does it an</font>

732
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,790
android<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> action call then</font>

733
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:39,320
initialize the call using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a using number</font>

734
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:43,040
which is that clear should actually

735
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,179
parses here and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> initializes recall</font>

736
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I wasn't able to get that</font>

737
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:52,170
because i was actually never sent that

738
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,410
those domains

739
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,410
[Music]

740
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,370
but yeah that's pretty much money to

741
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:08,158
talk about in regards to text analysis

742
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:10,408
doing some static code analysis there is

743
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,140
there's a lot of an hour to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at out</font>

744
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:17,549
there and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pry this like 10 or 20 to</font>

745
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,240
now we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caused worries i</font>

746
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:22,879
thought to have my head so

747
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,300
going on to talk about your space here's

748
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,300
a tune

749
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:33,760
so the cover the analysis of network

750
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,709
analysis during work various malware

751
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,360
statically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dynamically we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would see</font>

752
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,909
what it does now we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

753
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:44,039
about what happens Rebecca curious if

754
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:46,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bacteria so we're now working</font>

755
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,940
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stop analyzing our feet</font>

756
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,980
apart and putting out of a shoe I think

757
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the same but with no one else</font>

758
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,929
I don't know job any more than these

759
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys do and let's see that's the actual</font>

760
00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:00,159
problem so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a million</font>

761
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,860
apps right<font color="#E5E5E5"> really little thing or</font>

762
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,020
fitness to hold all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> workmen so</font>

763
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,969
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out we can do it by hand</font>

764
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:13,720
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to hang about we know</font>

765
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,510
what they are but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think also a giant</font>

766
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,280
I'd reject<font color="#CCCCCC"> east end so we can do it</font>

767
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:22,419
malleable takes forever or we go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

768
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,100
it in action save some time so jump is

769
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:26,140
what we can are we got your risk Excel

770
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,149
rules of the ways of fighting however

771
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,250
this particular in Kevin yet is

772
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,929
something I should worry about having

773
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,659
saved some of those social apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

774
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Paul</font>

775
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:35,659
a shipping and everything and pull

776
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:38,840
everything off your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and set it off</font>

777
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:41,149
to who knows where all my pictures are

780
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,489
lot of formations it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably bad but</font>

781
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,090
David covered that how that's it badly

782
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:55,489
but at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly apps are</font>

783
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,869
over the senior finish including<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

to future voyagers futures is over going

787
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">then I don't want to hold the futures</font>

788
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:09,200
video they want the information what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:10,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">ads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted now instead of waiting</font>

790
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,239
until they actually do the work and

791
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:16,340
build it build<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so is it true that I</font>

792
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,590
feel whole purpose of the provision yes

793
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,418
it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good at so it's not</font>

794
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,039
this way the best series could use to

795
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:24,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out we took a look at a bunch of</font>

796
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,509
apps in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pipe okay this looking really</font>

797
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:28,970
incredibly unique about being particular

798
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:31,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a person could out and it's very</font>

799
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,259
soon ended a false positive on a big

800
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:36,809
good at putting in cases of saying

801
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:39,120
social application it just ask

802
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:41,490
we tackle them and check out the whole

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">of users or take off the company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

807
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:55,758
in general we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad at</font>

808
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:58,499
mania I've had a kingdom now we're

809
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,299
together tool called topics and a little

810
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,370
jump up pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much everything from the</font>

811
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,399
androidmanifest.xml but they were

812
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,799
funding on earlier so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's</font>

813
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,330
like a pilot LX now that you could walk

814
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,369
through the whole thing organist parson

815
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,019
see I want me attempts<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Sam people</font>

816
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,908
going to fire off to this an apk and

817
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,039
make it do something or what if I wallow

818
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,919
permissions in this case provisions is

819
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,429
going to be our nurses can finish that

820
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">will give you a list tab if this gets</font>

821
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:28,259
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a particular out of the phone</font>

822
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:29,879
book go inspector<font color="#E5E5E5"> stealer or whatever</font>

823
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">but basically data to have like number</font>

824
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:36,748
some steeled up the main na back to the

825
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">eff what conversion to use excusing the</font>

826
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:41,940
access to teasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS did you</font>

827
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:43,830
find occasion of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> locations just</font>

828
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,549
whatever life I of every location

829
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,949
whatever I do feel

830
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,259
where you are and find a cheap difficult

831
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,539
so it's using<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS will send some back</font>

832
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to be another detective suffer from</font>

833
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:57,340
being over the contacts sending out a

834
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:59,559
backup to your location kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font>

835
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">but also could be used by something else</font>

836
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,869
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said basically that you I</font>

837
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:07,360
don't look at this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> app and of</font>

838
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:09,249
course since three stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it</font>

839
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,860
is the best way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it is</font>

840
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:17,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually I do you do with them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

841
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,570
another idea is let's look at the

842
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:22,149
developer certificates that every APK an

843
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:25,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android is a signed by the developer</font>

844
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:26,738
this isn't like a one location<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

845
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,019
browser and go to last row certificate

846
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:31,239

it wouldn't let the secrecy person it

with something like this you're running

960
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,790
be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so did we already</font>

961
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,189
can say a thousand as we know nothing

962
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,560
about and this comes up for like three

963

<font color="#CCCCCC">of them we're doing those quickly i'll</font>

what you have there like grappa offers

an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lay ordinate algorithm and i</font>

am but at like eight days be worth zero

970
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,200
to detect that and they have included so

971
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,119
this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little case for you to</font>

chipping away at them and you guys

976
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,590
better idea so once again you get the

979
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,729
have a better idea who did they decline

980
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,890
who's likely to attend not a fan but if

981
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,560
you can I gave it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them come with that</font>

questions

1022

most definitely there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

throw a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> baking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days currently</font>

ridiculously know if this was only and

1026
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,558
now there are actually another actually

1027
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:11,489
commercial characters for breaking case

1028
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,489
which actually

1029
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:17,089
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually have to figure out</font>

1030
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:21,529
yourself how two kinds of cribs

having to create those case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font>

1032
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's like three widely used</font>

of critters that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> built on time</font>

1035
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,430
and

1036
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,320
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> krypter for that matter just as</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">good as my values when I just make</font>

1039
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,670
and sometimes sometimes we'll have some

service I oppalia hypothesis which is

1041

mutates just mutates the ATK the same

malware it just mutates it just goes

1043
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,300
bye-bye so tired the tiny flowers

you can you just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can</font>

1046
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:14,770
definitely definitely smaller but at the

1047
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,979
same time though sometimes sometimes the

1048
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,270
malware will break<font color="#E5E5E5"> small me okay so if</font>

1049
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,800
you're actually if you're actually doing

if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it breaks Molly</font>

so once it was small I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tristar same</font>

server code the code actually breaks

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,499
like like any any other type of program

1055
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,650
there are there certain vulnerabilities

1056

that you used even given an even in

1072
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:52,470
i'm here to values the good news is look

1073
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,030
at the bad news is there's not really a

1074
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,509
whole lot you can do if it's he

1075
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:59,940
implemented correctly the best of my

1076
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:02,040
knowledge the good news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1077
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,480
looked at for short research<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

1078
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,270
talk of trying to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> good examples we</font>

1079
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,630
probably looked it at least at least 100

1080
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:12,120
known malware samples and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1081
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">known like actual ssl fitting on any of</font>

1082
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,470
them we did find we did find sometimes

1083
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,850
the connection we push out basically

1084
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same here that i was showing we</font>

1085
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,180
were going to render erupting but

1086
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,110
fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that we saw were on</font>

1087
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,350
the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> end and we could literally</font>

1088
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:27,930
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put continued narrator spine but a</font>

1089
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:30,210
very well implemented is something you

1090
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,890
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to probably pass it back to to</font>

1091
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,240
imagine talk about a runtime injection

1092
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,120
because you have to do some crazy stuff

1093
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work correctly that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

1094
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">have experience rip do you have an</font>

1095
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,670
answer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> every also you please do</font>

1096
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,920
great yeah

1097
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,990
right yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font>

1098
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,990
turn out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that position I was the same</font>

1099
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:06,470
idea that you can forget that way

1100
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,470
basically you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1101
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,610
did you do did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

1102
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:25,069
anyway I had a question yeah

1103
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,720
what

1104
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,720

another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they put it together</font>

1117
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,160
using that and you something much works

the first part which will actually just

00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:10,890
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point it out you like</font>

1131
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,390
where is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1132
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:17,190
what we can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell when piece of</font>

1133
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,730
the piece of code says install packages

1134
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:23,039
it says install packages and looking at

1135
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,289
the code and it you know looks like

1136
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,900
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's mostly ads or the</font>

1137
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:29,549
program doesn't work you know it just

1138
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,650
does a bunch of it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't much a</font>

1139
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:34,349
junk but it also has this ability to

1140
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">install packages you might want to live</font>

1141
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:38,789
that down like full look more deeper to

1142
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:41,010
figure out figure out that's actually

1143
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:43,349
downloading and it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumbing an</font>

1144
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">apk from a third party and then it's</font>

1145
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:51,380
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install a any more questions in</font>

1146
00:47:54,779 --> 00:48:04,279
where you get a new EP Kate's asked me

1147
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:09,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go really nicely oh that's nice a</font>

1148
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:09,169
google<font color="#E5E5E5"> play store yeah</font>

1149
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you can scrape google play store</font>

1150
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:22,170
you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> find other websites that may</font>

1151
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,610
be hosting those and we found that if

1152
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,800
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them now we're</font>

1153
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,980
obviously not work on stories never lose

1154
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,850
some like that Hawaiian

1155
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,680
grew further than that since a lot of

1156
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:38,310
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps are actually distributed to</font>

1157
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party app stores finding sort of</font>

1158
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:43,049
enlisted app stores in like China<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1159
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,299
Russia and stuff like that where the

1160
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,620
base<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjusted hey use our App Store</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1161
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,200
you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay that man touch</font>

1162
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,240
with this app has a significantly higher

1163
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,799
infection or and as you might imagine I

1164
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,109
mean they're going in and cracking in

1165
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,840
anyways well I'll just harvest<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1166
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">dates of data too so so we did these</font>

1167
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,600
various sources I wish it were I wish it

1168
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,660
were easier for a good look that I get

1169
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,640
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I promise I won't hire them but I</font>

1170
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:11,970
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would necessarily let</font>

1171
