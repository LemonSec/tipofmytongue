38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,009
about every month or so they would ask

39
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,200
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change my password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I would</font>

40
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,738
you know being as clever as I was I

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,560

next time it was dog named 13 and now

44
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:31,170

skip a few you know dog named 19<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog</font>

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,389
is the boring job so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

49
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,638
time researching and I got got into

50
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,190
researching security most actually

51
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,220
hacking

52
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,900
and and I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested and I</font>

53
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,650
learned a few tricks you know how to

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,780
it's just tricks and I got this

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,580
reputation around the office being the

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,630
office hacker you know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things that made me look less</font>

58
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:04,480
smart and I really was one day one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

59
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,430
the managers came to me and said they

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,040
had this problem what happened was the

61
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,770
network administrator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VP got an</font>

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,540
argument and the administrator just left

63
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,180
the company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't tell anyone</font>

64
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,920
his passwords now the BP was too

65
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,140
stubborn to call and asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,359
passwords so this manager comes to me

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,760
and says you know he wants me since I'm

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hacker you know he wants me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,750
it wants me to go and break all the

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,609
passwords for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said</font>

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,080
yeah okay sure but I got thinking about

72
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,150
like oh no would I get myself into

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,870

76
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,350
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized is that people have</font>

77
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,690
really bad password it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me I</font>

pretty good at guessing but I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,070
one system to another got all this guy

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,820
that's kind of knowing is seen how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

149
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,810
they're good you know there's a you know

150
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,699
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are many of them are solid</font>

151
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,979
and for this thing is there we need a

152
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,690
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them it owned and each one's</font>

proprietary each one they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

154
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,590
with each other and each one requires a

155
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:08,800
major investment in the company so

156
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's kind of what I hate there's some</font>

with one of the students there one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,149
the doctor says he needed more time here

186
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:54,729
to used up all his time on the system so

187
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:57,810
he found out there was a file i see here

188
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,810
grab my thing

189
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,160
you accnt da secret was was a file that

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,569
had all the passwords in it and even

191
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">though he didn't have access to the file</font>

192
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:11,569
he they had this system where when you

193
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,099
wound up 11 run a print job and you know

194
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:14,389
usually took a while to queue at the

195
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,399
print job and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all printed and get</font>

196
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:18,860
it you know go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it yeah you</font>

197
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,899
did submit a punch card with it your

198
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,370
account name the name of the file you

199
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted and then you go and pick it up</font>

200
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:28,399
later so he submitted that file he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

201
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,439
system account name and when picked up

202
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,329
the password file later in a little

203
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:37,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">pronunciate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all accounts so that's a</font>

204
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">first Patrick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so graphical</font>

205
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:52,189
passwords graphical passwords so we

206
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:54,560
spend like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time working</font>

207
00:09:52,189 --> 00:10:00,399
on graphical passwords other people

208
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,540
found a long time but you know there's a

209
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I pick on graphical passwords</font>

210
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,329
because it's a good example of going

211
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:13,490
astray and with the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a research</font>

212
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:16,729
and 17,000 911 patents for graphical

213
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,949
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> and image-based passwords 7m</font>

214
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,990
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 17</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand nine</font>

215
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:22,279
hundred and low<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pat pat I mean I</font>

216
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,819
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one through all</font>

217
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:29,209
the way okay I mean we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need</font>

218
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:36,189
any more practical passport scheme

219
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:42,699
there's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,100 us research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

220
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:45,680
scholarly documents oh the written about

221
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:49,300
graphical passwords games I mean it's

222
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">just we spent way too much time</font>

223
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,140
figuring out problems that we really

224
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:58,589
weren't really problems in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

225
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,730
place and really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need solving so</font>

226
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,570
the flood okay well first of all that

227
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:08,740
graphical password schemes are usually

228
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:12,579
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just presented several 10</font>

229
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,920
minutes already wow several images you

230
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:20,410
pick one or two that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a lot more</font>

231
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,699
ranting to do come on or you that's

232
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,000
right anyone wants to hear any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

233
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,130
round<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chanukah okay so when you pick a</font>

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,079
picture or you pick some points<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

235
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,420
picture or you draw a shape or something

236
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:34,239
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the flaws are that</font>

237
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,800
it's a small key space now a lot of

238
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,529
people argue these you see lose these

239
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,569
formulas in the research papers that say

240
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:44,740
how large is key space is the wrong okay

241
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,390
the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is small most of</font>

242
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,660
them they're based on visual

243
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,709
interactions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you've limited</font>

244
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:57,399
people with with with with visual

245
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:58,899
impairments you have issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> with if</font>

246
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,180
there's if you don't have a graphical

247
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,589
screen or graphical environment you

248
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,109
can't use it with an API or anything

249
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,240
like that another problem is they're not

250
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,750
exact so they have to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

251
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,850
fuzzy if you don't hit the right spot on

252
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,899
the screen or whatever or if you do

253
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:20,589
allow that then they're there I mean if

254
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:22,120
you're not exact that was a new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

255
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,980
basically saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

256
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,750
pad for where they let you enter it in

257
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,149
one letter off and they'll still accept

258
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,310
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay or they're too exact where you</font>

259
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,980
get a lot of false negatives and

260
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">rejected for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues a lot of</font>

261
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:41,949
times the these schemes are based on

262
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,449
giving that you have to debate some

263
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,370
logic where it has to make a decision

264
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,380
whether to let you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not you can't</font>

265
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,170
just take like a password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hash it</font>

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,970
and compare it so there are fighting on

267
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,560
the scheme of our issues on storing the

268
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,959
hash they actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to store and</font>

269
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,899
encrypted form the actual answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

270
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,270
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shoulder surfing less</font>

271
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,010
convenient sometimes they can it

272
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,310
actually easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to type in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

273
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,870
word then picking pictures from the

274
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,089
screen or whatever moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mouse</font>

275
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,320
around and there's still a password

276
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,520
they're still knowledge-based and still

277
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:24,040
have a lot of the same weaknesses of

278
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:26,319
passwords now the we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one</font>

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,180
of the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it's been 50</font>

280
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,540
years and we've got we really haven't

281
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">made a lot of progress on passwords I</font>

282
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,839
mean we've come up with some things

283
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've come up with some some good ideas</font>

284
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the policies are you know</font>

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things have relaxed and we people are a</font>

286
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,340
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter admins a little</font>

287
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,260
smarter out how to do things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

288
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:49,840
once on a mailing list was about about

289
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:51,310
15 years ago where I I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

290
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,660
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> length is all that really</font>

291
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,579
matters are talking about complexity

292
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,290
character sets all seven I said you know

293
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,340
if you have the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

294
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,740
that really doesn't matter which

295
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,170
characters are in there I got so much

296
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,140
hate mail from that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean jeez so</font>

297
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,729
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's taken a while just to get</font>

298
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,340
that and you know just the basic things

299
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,570
down I mean we're still having secret

300
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,900
questions where they asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your eye</font>

301
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,460
color and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says it's we still haven't</font>

302
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,140
really got the basics down let alone the

303
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,850
more difficult problems so I was

304
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would help if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

305
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,680
more standardization give us figure out

306
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:27,250
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what our problems are what our</font>

307
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,900
weaknesses are and go from there that

308
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,450
way that way we know where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

309
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,090
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> our effort authentication</font>

310
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">standards there's a number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unk we may</font>

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:41,230
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> her the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fido</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alliance little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> midas</font>

312
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,730
security coalition motto and there's all

313
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,850
these competing groups trying to develop

314
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,020
standards of course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phyto alliances</font>

315
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,460
we've got a quite a bit of industry

316
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,470
support but they're also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

317
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,650
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to establish these</font>

318
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:58,360
standards but what we really need our

319
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics the these alliances are mostly</font>

320
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">AP is for communicating but the metrics</font>

321
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:07,170
are really what tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what is what's</font>

322
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our systems verify there are</font>

323
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,339
mechanisms for authenticating really

324
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oregon working the way we think would</font>

325
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,399
they work its guidance for developers

326
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,260
that helps you when you want to purchase

327
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,120
products and you understand really just

328
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,560
you quantify the strengths and

329
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">weaknesses of any system oh come on</font>

330
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,989
there we go so no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's her</font>

331
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,149
okay that this is what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

332
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:37,660
standards okay so this is a patent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

333
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,490
found one day fingerprints you know

334
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,170
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like fingerprints so hey</font>

335
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,510
someone thought have a great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

336
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,160
fingerprint on a device you know a

337
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,519
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake fingerprints so you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

338
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,930
you've got a fingerprint but a device

339
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,940
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting the</font>

340
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,569
best of both worlds you get the worst of

341
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,000
both worlds but so anyway one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

342
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,339
groups is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID ESG and they have done a</font>

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,519
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work on standardizing come up</font>

344
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:07,440
these metrics coming up with these

345
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,779
principles guiding principles for house

346
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,850
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen it's still</font>

347
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,920
really unorganized it's still really

348
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,690
much very much in sipping see but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

349
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I've seen that has the most</font>

350
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,449
potential I think we we as a community

351
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,360
should participate in that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> guide the</font>

352
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:28,810
the guide that the way the direction we

353
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,750
take on authentication but beyond what

354
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,760
they they've established we've got

355
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,320
accessibility issues I mean my

356
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,430
ten-year-old doesn't have a cell phone

357
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,910
my father-in-law<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a cell</font>

358
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,729
phone would play would not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

359
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:48,600
there's so you know authentication going

360
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:52,660
through SMS isn't going to work with him

361
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,930
there's legal issues there's ethical

362
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,089
considerations for example using

363
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,699
biometrics and rolling people without

364
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:03,459
their knowledge facebook has done this

365
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:07,530
where they they use behavioral analysis

366
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:10,059
to see if to understand it's really you

367
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,760
working on work on the side or

368
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,668
interacting the site that's kind of a

369
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,919
light example but the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> could for</font>

370
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,919
example take pictures as you're walking

371
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,770
in and use that enroll you basically

372
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,240
into a authentication system without

373
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,480
your thought your knowledge there's also

374
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,830
cultural issues there's also issues like

375
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,250
some people just don't like touching

376
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,070
things

377
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,140
people touched so a fingerprint scanner

378
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:42,360
may not be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea for people like</font>

379
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so design patterns o mighty no time</font>

380
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:49,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so another thing we need to do is</font>

381
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,010
we establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-defined design</font>

382
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,050
patterns we've done things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

383
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,270
we've said you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a hash</font>

384
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,190
assault<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your hash you've got a</font>

385
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,250
certain process as you go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

386
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,510
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resets but I mean we're</font>

387
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">still having problems with secret</font>

388
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,460
questions all these things token and

389
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,320
attribute whining is another area<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

390
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

391
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,320
that multiple T factor authentication

392
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,960
people are still doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wrong what</font>

393
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,050
you have course multi-factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh there's</font>

394
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,810
an issue here with usability like I said

395
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,669
my father-in-law or my ten-year-old I

396
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,159
mean do we have we don't really have

397
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,510
systems or they'll really work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

398
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,970
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that who don't really</font>

399
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,270
understand computer very well or who are

400
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">too young or may have other disabilities</font>

401
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,810
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have good ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scale</font>

402
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,720
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> though that user bait user base</font>

403
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:45,790
scalability I have a my key chain has

404
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,980
like 10 tokens on it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware</font>

405
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,399
tokens because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i like</font>

406
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">harbor tokens but come on does anyone</font>

407
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,020
else like hard work tokens so uh you

408
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go so far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

409
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,760
can only have so many Hardware tokens

410
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,760
and to really have that security you've

411
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,180
got us have some kind of way to make

412
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:15,820
this work on a user scalable basis lost

413
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:18,070
recovery recovering from losing your

414
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:22,000
token or the token breaking a token

415
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,610
wearing down and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies</font>

416
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,560
allow multiple tokens but they only let

417
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,879
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use one at a time you can choose and</font>

418
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,830
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> support different methods but they</font>

419
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,740
only let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick one it would be nice</font>

420
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,330
if I could use a hardware token white

421
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,820
log in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home a different</font>

422
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,310
token white login homework and maybe a

423
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,750
different token 1 i'm like a

424
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,530
authentication a Google Authenticator

425
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,410
number

426
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,730
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> be number wherever when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I log in</font>

427
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,900
from my phone I mean it would it would

428
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nice to be able to have multiple</font>

429
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:56,480
tokens one thing that google supports is

430
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,399
having multiple tokens when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in</font>

431
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:04,250
so if you lose one you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a backup</font>

432
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,080
one to recover so if multiple multi

433
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,710
factors it would be nice table to be

434
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,970
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more than one token if we</font>

435
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,590
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the thing is that we really</font>

436
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't established guidelines for how</font>

437
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,370
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know that we haven't</font>

438
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really said you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support multiple</font>

439
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:24,080
tokens you need a support you know this

440
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this minnow amount of security just like</font>

441
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,689
with LastPass I mean you you log in with

442
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,920
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ubik hear something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

443
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your phone you just log in with your</font>

444
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,750
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it goes you know it lets you</font>

445
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">log in with that you don't have to</font>

446
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,770
provide the second factor presumably

447
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:44,660
your phone is the second factor but you

448
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:49,070
can lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone so well I miss all</font>

449
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:51,590
my good stories so wound<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a</font>

450
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,620
good story this is my conclusion is a

451
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,889
story so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to play around my kids</font>

452
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,320
and have them tight passwords behind my

453
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:03,110
back like common passwords and I guess

454
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,149
what the password was so one time years

455
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:08,229
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was doing a sales meeting</font>

456
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,550
with a client and the admin gets up and

457
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,080
and I was actually passing a kidney

458
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,899
stone<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a time so I was kind of like</font>

459
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,580
this with man but he types in this

460
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,010
password and I recognize it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

461
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,899
admin 123 I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew this password</font>

462
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,450
so well sound of it who type it

463
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:27,350
sometimes it sounds really<font color="#E5E5E5"> distinct um</font>

464
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">hi set up my shirt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password admin 123 it</font>

465
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,429
was like quiet per second awesome the

466
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,830
whole room burst out laughing this admin

467
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:38,270
turn bright red but yeah good skill to

468
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:42,980
have um so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the job though</font>

469
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:45,230
the thing so anyway I mean we're a world

470
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,390
of Secrets we've got passwords but we

471
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,950
really haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed much I mean you</font>

472
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,630
read them these old mailing lists and

473
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,740
they're saying having the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

474
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same discussion that we're</font>

475
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,100
having today we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't figured</font>

476
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,419
us out and we kind of as a community

477
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,449
need a he

478
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,369
contribute and guide the thinking and

479
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,999
the guide the research and and write

480
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,830
blog posts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and establishes where</font>

481
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,359
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in our effort what</font>

482
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,619
are the problems that are unsolved that

483
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:20,418
we really haven't solved yet that's it

484
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten questions I I noticed that you use</font>

485
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,019
the example dog's name many times

486
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:25,758
without if we're telling us the dog's

487
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,539
name is it is that because you still use

488
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:34,340
absolute ass or something some password

489
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:37,460
you just can't change dog 2015 yeah I'm

490
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,859
when way past that sorry I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

491
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:46,820
gonna ask you the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dog 15</font>

492
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:49,399

493
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,989
should stick around for the last walk as

494
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:55,908
well I could be interesting well since

495
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:57,799
we're doing light hard questions what

496
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,809
are your views on the use of janitors

497
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">key rings for multiple physical tokens</font>

498
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,090
no that's a great idea that's about

499
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,850
where i'm but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move into</font>

501
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,928
loses everything we've gone through like

502
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:15,168
six cell phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave him a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toga you</font>

504
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deal with me so I gave him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a token to</font>

505
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">log into the county he lost it I mean</font>

506
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:24,080

507
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:26,029
big long chain I'm the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I gave</font>

508
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,759
him a big long chain and he still<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

509
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave up yeah I should have I should</font>

510
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:33,980
have gotten one of those janitor of

511
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:37,639
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark actually has done a book</font>

512
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:41,509
on passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember purchasing that</font>

513
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:43,549
online just how to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I wrote</font>

514
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:45,369
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago and it's all still</font>

515
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,619
valid much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it still valid today I</font>

516
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:50,539
mean I I have no better answer than and

517
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,590
then you on like white we continue

518
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,570
getting stuck but one thing I have

519
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,249
observed is that a common thread is when

520
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,629
people start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know how</font>

521
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,739
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of passwords is thing they</font>

522
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:59,090
always started sinking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

523
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:00,859
absolute wrong place and making a long

524
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,970
list of what's wrong with passwords if

525
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,830
you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of them you be far</font>

526
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,029
better off making a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's right</font>

527
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,710
with passwords because it gives you a

528
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,629
better understanding of you know I hate

529
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,660
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have beaten everyone who's</font>

530
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:11,310
climbed into the ring

531
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,720
with them in the last you know quarter

532
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,860
century I make a list of everything

533
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,620
that's right with them gives you a

534
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,780
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea yeah exactly and that's it's</font>

535
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,280
always passwords are broken so hey let's

536
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,800
get rid of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's replace them and</font>

537
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,690
then the first logical conclusions what

538
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,149
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if we can log in with pictures</font>
