right good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone my name is</font>

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,619
Guillaume and today we'll be talking

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,259
about iOS you're all schemes and that's

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple iOS and not cisco iOS the reason</font>

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:41,160
why the eye is uppercase is just my font

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:43,920
was not good so display changed with

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,319
this in your slides looking incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,649
there a way to tell the other slide I do

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,199
apologize I didn't I no no I mean in the

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,670
presentation software yes can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we tell it</font>

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,968
wasn't intentional resolution now<font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,379
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it just means that the</font>

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,660
sliding up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look quite right I can</font>

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,610
apologize ahead on the recording you

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,530
mean cuz they look good there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,170
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide them to</font>

20
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,850
you in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different format after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,840
again I do apologize for that I just

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,780
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you know</font>

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:24,479
recording everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right</font>

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you for those testing oh there's</font>

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:36,030
no speakers right 12 yeah they're

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,990
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so take to my name is</font>

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,030
guillaumin we're going to be talking

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,119
about the iOS URL schemes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already</font>

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">made that joke so I won't do it again so</font>

30
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,659
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're an iOS user have you ever</font>

31
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,869
wondered how communication between

32
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,240
application works most applications feel

33
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,860
pretty isolated like their little

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,240
islands and you do your stuff you move

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,700
to a different application you do some

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,899
other stuff but in some cases a small

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,060
amount of data is passed from one

38
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,860
application to the other and magic

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,579
happens and it makes you save a lot of

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,810
time so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic example that i'm</font>

41
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,400
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show here is just you're using</font>

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,020
google and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for bars in</font>

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,710
Las Vegas because of course you need

44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,770
Google to find

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,360
one and as soon as you find one what you

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,790
want to do is call maybe to make a

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,800
reservation so this application that's

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,959
just the google the google app for iOS

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,790
as soon as you click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call button</font>

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,370
is going to prompt you and say do you

51
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,070
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that place and then</font>

52
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,630
you say yes and the phone call is placed

53
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,130
so you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to type in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

54
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,620
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just save it a bit of</font>

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,780
time so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the different methods</font>

56
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">an application can use to exchange</font>

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,040
information we got a few there's the

58
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,720
cloud and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the cloud that only</font>

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">in iCloud because I cloud is really</font>

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,780
sandboxed so I call these goods for

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,119
sharing data between the same

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,070
application on multiple devices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,260
not good to share data<font color="#CCCCCC"> between different</font>

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,940
applications for now there's the

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,890
pasteboard which is similar to a

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,560
clipboard on iOS it's not really meant

67
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,410
for interrupt communications then we got

68
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,330
hacks what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hats is stuff</font>

69
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,770
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not meant to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for this but</font>

70
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,410
that some applications have tried in the

71
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,750
past for example storing contacts and

72
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,820
reminders as configuration data so

73
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,680
multiple apps could read them that works

74
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,910
fine except Apple is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull the</font>

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,430
application from the app store as soon

76
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">as they notice so that's no good then we</font>

77
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,000
got the opening menu I'm sure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

78
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,250
you do that like you email files to

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,750
yourself then you do open in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox</font>

80
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,790
and do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you end up with</font>

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,820
multiple copies of the same file so

82
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,040
that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good either we</font>

83
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,680
have airdrop only good to send data

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">between two devices not between two</font>

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,850
applications so what we're left with and

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,710
this is clearly a case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> using whatever</font>

87
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:49,230
we have available is<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs so today we'll</font>

88
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,570
see what these URLs will do how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

89
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,600
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you some good examples</font>

90
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,519
and bad examples of how to use them

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,590
ideas for using them more securely and

92
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,770
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you how you can find some more</font>

93
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,260
vulnerabilities in these you all schemes

94
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,690
so what they do is implement very basic

95
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,000
communication between applications so

96
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,829
you have a source<font color="#E5E5E5"> application you have a</font>

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,660
trigger a trigger could be a user

98
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,140
clicking a button that says send this to

99
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,760
my to-do list or send this to my notes

100
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,798
you got the destination app that

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,159
receives the data handles it and that in

102
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,630
just enable the workflow so how does the

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,560
source application know what the

104
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,090
destination application is

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,340
applications get installed whenever you

106
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,679
install an application directly on iOS

107
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,690
device or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> iTunes it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,480
register its handler a handler is

109
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,219
basically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP column / / in a URL</font>

110
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,190
except the applications can register

111
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,900
pretty much anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want so</font>

112
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,860
are these registration registered

113
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,450
handles are unique well not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,030
there's a few you can't ever reuse these

115
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,520
are the basic schemes that just come

116
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,690
pre-installed on iOS no application<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

117
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,130
reuse these and that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

118
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,050
reasons why you can't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

119
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,630
default mail browser on iOS because you

120
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,850
can't just take that mail scheme and use

121
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:07,330
it for yourself so these are pretty

122
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,070
simple the mail one is just like on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC</font>

123
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,950
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> male 2 so you click on a link it</font>

124
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,570
pre populates an email the telephone one

125
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,889
which we saw before<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just passing a</font>

126
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,950
phone number to the telephone

127
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,240
application SMS works the same and it

128
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,979
works with I message as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these</font>

129
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,169
are all pretty simple then we got some

130
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,630
slightly more complicated ones like<font color="#CCCCCC"> maps</font>

131
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,010
if you have a restaurant<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

132
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,900
could have a button that would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

133
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,260
user to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps app</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and trigger the</font>

134
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:36,070
directions to that restaurant<font color="#E5E5E5"> iTunes as</font>

135
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,409
one has anyone ever ended up on a not so

136
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,240
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> shady looking website that just</font>

137
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,520
redirected you to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> App Store so you</font>

138
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,690
would buy like a crappy flappy bird

139
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,849
clone or something weird like that

140
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,890
that's what is used for that to use the

141
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">iTunes URL scheme to do that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do</font>

142
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because you get money from all the</font>

143
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:53,169
purchases that you make on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> App Store</font>

144
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,450
and then we got facetime which we will

145
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">see more details</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later on that can be</font>

146
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,270
used for audio and video calls then

147
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,909
there's some even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced use</font>

148
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,530
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that enable two-way communication</font>

149
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,840
so what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

150
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:11,049
called day one it's a diary application

151
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,609
that does not really encrypt up your

152
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,750
note so what you want to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

153
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,450
obviously you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store that in</font>

154
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,270
dropbox right so this application knows

155
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,250
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dropbox works and in the settings</font>

156
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,039
you will see there's an option to enable

157
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,630
Dropbox synchronization so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

158
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:32,510
click on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dropbox button it's going</font>

159
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:35,090
to send me to dropbox and it's

160
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,580
drop box appears it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask me do</font>

161
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to grant this day one</font>

162
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,950
application access to this folder and as

163
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,560
soon as I click allow Dropbox knows how

164
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,760
to send the information back everything

165
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,100
is enabled I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to</font>

166
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,260
dropbox com and give permissions or do

167
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,880
anything special so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a user that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

168
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,960
fantastic that was easy that was fast

169
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,360
was that secure well different<font color="#E5E5E5"> story so</font>

170
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,239
as we do automated workflows like that

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,250
what can happen is over automation so

172
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,780
the example I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show here this</font>

173
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,550
application is just a launcher so these

174
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,229
icons that you see they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

175
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,450
there's nothing funky<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in this</font>

176
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,490
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as I click that you'll</font>

177
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,380
see really quick a calendar application

178
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,840
flashing and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the b-sides</font>

179
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,659
website so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened I go back to my</font>

180
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,669
calendar and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that tells</font>

181
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">me I need to crash the Nike party</font>

182
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,650
because why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nike have a party at</font>

183
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,330
blackhat that's just weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> how did that</font>

184
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,630
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now I'll click the real link</font>

185
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,370
and again it flashes really fast I'm in

186
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Safari what happened I go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

187
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,620
calendar now I got to so it just created

188
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">an item in my calendar and this is</font>

189
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,510
fantastical a pretty popular third-party

190
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,400
a calendar for iOS and I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it flash by</font>

191
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,120
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> no user interaction was really</font>

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,590
needed and why is that well that's

193
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,770
because the developer when he made this

194
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,320
application added kind of an evil bit

195
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,820
and that evil bit is add equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 when</font>

196
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> add that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to whatever data you sent</font>

197
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,420
to it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask for anything</font>

198
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,470
it's just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

199
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a calendar that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

200
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,670
dangerous it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying if I set</font>

201
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:12,530
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wake you up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the morning</font>

202
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:14,570
tomorrow I'll did I send that back to

203
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,309
the b-sides website it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

204
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,070
application supports a standard called<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

205
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,780
callback URL that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a standard that</font>

206
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,670
developers have been using<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send data</font>

207
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,229
to one application and then receive the

208
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,570
response back so you can have more

209
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,850
advanced workflows so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack surface</font>

210
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,340
grows the more stuff we add the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

211
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,990
potential for something to go wrong so

212
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,569
this example which I borrowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

213
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,520
website called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max Teresa's just to show</font>

214
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how big the attack surface can get</font>

215
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,380
with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so what we see right</font>

216
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,848
now is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard iOS browser</font>

217
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,400
someone is just selected a piece of text

218
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,860
is going to click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a bookmark</font>

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,350
in his in his book marks which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

220
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,590
piece of JavaScript code this<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

221
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,360
code took that text and trigger the URL

222
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,790
scheme for another application which is

223
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">a notes application called drafts this</font>

224
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">application runs Python that's what you</font>

225
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop there because yes you can</font>

226
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually execute some other languages on</font>

227
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,660
iOS now once that application is done it

228
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,630
triggers a different URL scheme that

229
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,819
sends that data to a to-do app where the

230
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,800
guy can put this URL add a little

231
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,990
comment and when he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> done he's just</font>

232
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say add and it's going to ask</font>

233
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">him do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to your</font>

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,660
browser so in this example we had a

235
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,449
browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript code a notes</font>

236
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,770
application Python code a to-do list and

237
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,270
then back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so there's</font>

238
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:32,510
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of potential for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things to</font>

239
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,610
go wrong so the first person to find

240
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">things going wrong with these is an</font>

241
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,590
attached and Johnny in 2010 he found an

242
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,210
issue with skype that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

243
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,490
place a phone call phone call with skype

244
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,290
with no user interaction and he posted

245
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,960
about that on his blog and on sands

246
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,969
website but sky back then was one of the

247
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,230
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few applications that use that so</font>

248
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,370
we didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear more about that</font>

249
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,470
since 2010 and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting</font>

250
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,170
thing he found and you can't see it on

251
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen shot right there so here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

252
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,150
code he found that Safari will execute

253
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,180
any URL scheme automatically if it's

254
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,010
located within an iframe an inline frame

255
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,170
so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff i just i was showing</font>

256
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,700
before could be triggered as you're

257
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,920
browsing the web site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the</font>

258
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,750
second part that these kind of crappy

259
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,760
websites use to send you<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the app</font>

260
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,530
store so I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> what can I do with</font>

261
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,380
that that would be a little bit more

262
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,750
evil than that so I looked at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

263
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,580
applications I had on my phone and i

264
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,050
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> this first one the application is</font>

265
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,650
called by word it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good text</font>

266
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,930
editor for mac ipad and iOS and it had a

267
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,199
feature to overwrite a file using a URL

268
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,359
scheme that's not a weird so it looked

269
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,570
like this by doing this you would

270
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,150
replace the file important txt in iCloud

271
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,950
with the text for the laws<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

272
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous file has been overwritten and</font>

273
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,000
unlike Dropbox iCloud doesn't really let

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,440
you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a previous version so</font>

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,410
that's permanent data loss for most

276
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,850
users and iCloud is pretty flat so

277
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,449
guessing that someone might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a file</font>

278
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,950
called

279
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:06,140
no txt or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to txt or important txt</font>

280
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,130
doesn't sound that hard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reported</font>

281
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the issue to the vendor they</font>

282
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledged within a few weeks a patch</font>

283
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,650
was out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the patch is just there's a</font>

284
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">warning sign now so it basically goes</font>

285
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,699
are you sure you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroy</font>

286
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,680
your data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you say yes well</font>

287
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,060
then it just does it so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,050
lot better than it was before<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not</font>

289
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,430
much so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> day I looked at some</font>

290
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,010
other applications I had on my phone and

291
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,620
tweet bot is one of the most popular iOS

292
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,550
sweater clients and it has a scheme that

293
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,190
allowed you to follow a user so my first

294
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,770
thought was oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god all my friends are</font>

295
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:44,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be falling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Justin Bieber soon</font>

296
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:46,310
and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact code so I notified</font>

297
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,110
the vendor they acknowledge that this

298
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,430
was a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue it took them a</font>

299
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,740
little while they<font color="#E5E5E5"> released</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a paid</font>

300
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,030
upgrade which fixed the issue and any

301
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,250
went back and it did fix the the

302
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">previous version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that took a while</font>

303
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,930
and from a security perspective that's

304
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the world I mean you just</font>

305
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,739
followed someone you can unfollow them

306
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,050
so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so bad well it's really bad</font>

307
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">for your privacy because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter can</font>

308
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,890
send you notifications when someone is

309
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,720
just started following you so even if

310
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,030
you unfollowed them they know what your

311
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter account is and if you mix that</font>

312
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,079
with the fact that Safari will execute

313
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,210
these automatically that's a really good

314
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,030
way to identify a website user and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

315
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,610
anonymize them so here's what it

316
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,560
actually looked like so what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

317
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a phishing email it just says</font>

318
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,739
something about a Canadian mayor smoking

319
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,719
crack so you should know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing</font>

320
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,700
right that's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far-fetched</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm just</font>

321
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight the video link just</font>

322
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just shows that the URL I'm clicking</font>

323
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,200
on is a perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal valid URL and</font>

324
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,210
as soon as I click it you'll see Safari

325
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,810
flashing really fast with a troll face

326
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,790
and then I'm sent to tweet bot and at

327
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,319
the top and there's a local crapping

328
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,270
issue here but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you are not</font>

329
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">following Justin Bieber and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

330
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,020
really fast and there's nothing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

331
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:03,410
do to stop it once it starts so I just

332
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,670
unfollowed him and fun fact I tested

333
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,400
that like hundreds of times and I never

334
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">got banned by Twitter for it I seen seem</font>

335
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,709
to be weird use case and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

336
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,600
how could I make this even worse

337
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,940
automated maybe could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use ad networks</font>

338
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,070
and embed this these inline frames in

339
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,720
there and get a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to follow</font>

340
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,580
me or follow someone else that would be

341
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,650
pretty evil but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured there's not</font>

342
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,910
enough people that use<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweetbot I know a</font>

343
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people that do that but that's</font>

344
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because I know a lot of geeks most</font>

345
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,589
people just use the standard Twitter

346
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,620
application so that wasn't that wasn't

347
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,120
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really was looking for so I get</font>

348
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,680
back to my phone and I look at the

349
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,540
applications i have and i figured what's

350
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,180
more popular than<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweetbot that i have</font>

351
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could be used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i found</font>

352
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">facetime pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone who's got</font>

353
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,870
an iOS device uses facetime right the

354
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,819
issue is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the tweet</font>

355
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,340
bought one so it's a really important

356
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,580
privacy risk because it affects most iOS

357
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,220
users so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is FaceTime used</font>

358
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,500
to be video only in iOS 6 in previous

359
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,980
versions and they added FaceTime audio

360
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,870
in iOS 7 the video calls would ask you

361
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,910
for confirmation before placing it but

362
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,130
the audio calls did not I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

363
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,930
and I also don't know why they called<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

364
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,100
FaceTime audio that's a really stupid

365
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,069
name you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it voice</font>

366
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,650
time which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be much better so this</font>

367
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,300
inline frame on any website would make

368
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,650
you call me that's my email address

369
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,040
that's my iCloud account please don't

370
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,930
hack it so that would call me and as

371
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,760
soon as the call is placed I see the

372
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,280
color ID information so if you're using

373
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,510
your iCloud email address i see that if

374
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,360
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using your phone number for</font>

375
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">facetime i see that so if there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

376
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,200
that's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> i OS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 2706 or that's got the</font>

377
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,930
latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version and has chrome well demo</font>

378
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">gods plus AT&T roaming equals two</font>

379
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,829
percent chance of success<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you</font>

380
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,360
browse there during the top that's

381
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,770
probably going to call my phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

382
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,000
on you so we can do a small live demo

383
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,699
but I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what it looked like</font>

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,730
so you can see my wonderful office on

385
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left is my iPad so I'm</font>

386
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,270
just browsing a website I'm just

387
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,470
clicking a link i know you don't you

388
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see the text but it's not really</font>

389
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,160
important and as soon as I click on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

390
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,660
link the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recording stops on my iPad</font>

391
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,670
because it doesn't let you record when

392
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,439
you're placing a call and on my phone I

393
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,910
see my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name I would see the email</font>

394
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">address or the phone number but I have</font>

395
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,630
myself in my contacts which might sound

396
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,819
weird but it's just so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to</font>

397
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,490
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and it happens really fast</font>

398
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,510
even if you hang up your caller ID info

399
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,970
is already there

400
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple secure coding guide</font>

401
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,540
and what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it say about these you're</font>

402
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,550
all schemes they say whether you make

403
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,290
the comments public or not hackers will

404
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,849
try sending commands to your application

405
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> history of</font>

406
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,520
the world you just made something

407
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,729
someone is trying is going to try to

408
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">break it and then what did they do they</font>

409
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,510
fixed Safari so Safari prompts you

410
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,189
before calling someone but there's a

411
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole bunch of other applications</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

412
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,270
are browsers on iOS and the issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

413
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,710
fixed for these guys because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

414
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,260
the facetime application that's been

415
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,660
fixed so i looked at the browser i had

416
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,520
on my phone the browser's i had on my

417
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,370
phone and i had a few that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use quite a</font>

418
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,660
bit so one password really good guys

419
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,080
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

420
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,719
they fixed it super fast the second one

421
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">is onion browser it's an official tor</font>

422
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,260
browser for iOS not the bad one that was

423
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,390
malware the the real one so I spoke to

424
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,890
the developer it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not impacted and I</font>

425
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,660
said eight did you think about this is

426
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,760
that on purpose they said no I didn't

427
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:32,120
have time to implement the external URL

428
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,710
scheme stuff but when I do I'll make

429
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,300
sure that we're really careful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

430
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,550
external<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> launched</font>

431
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the user is in tour only in the</font>

432
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,760
browser because its iOS so it doesn't

433
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,850
get done at the network at the system

434
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,110
level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google said that's not really</font>

435
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,930
a chrome problem that's more like a

436
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,820
chromium problem I don't really care

437
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,530
that there's an issue maybe someone

438
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,180
should fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they sent me to a</font>

439
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,400
tread where people say this can't really

440
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,979
be used maliciously so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

441
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,420
to add a warning I think I proved it

442
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be used maliciously but whatever</font>

443
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,709
they're kind of right that Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

444
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,089
fix facetime then i looked at the

445
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">twitter application the real twitter</font>

446
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,708
application which has a built-in browser

447
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,958
like so many other applications do so if

448
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,110
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know who a twitter user is</font>

449
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,510
just send<font color="#CCCCCC"> him a link that's got this</font>

450
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,510
inline frame that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i showed before so as</font>

451
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,190
soon as he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click on that link</font>

452
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">the call is established and you know who</font>

453
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,400
he is so if you know too if you need to

454
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,708
know someone's phone number it's really

455
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,690
really useful and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font>

456
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,320
in every application that's got you I

457
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,820
webs<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and WebKit pretty much maybe</font>

458
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,330
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fixed eventually we'll</font>

459
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,189
see then back to the seeker coding guide

460
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,919
by Apple they say don't implement

461
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,830
useless features which sounds really

462
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,480
basic right don't accept arbitrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

463
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,090
and pads because you could really easily

464
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,040
have Pat reversal issues with these URL

465
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,990
schemes they also say watch out for

466
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,399
buffer overflows because all iOS

467
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,650
applications in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the store right now</font>

468
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,270
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all objective c so there's big</font>

469
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,400
potential for buffer overflows there and

470
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,110
apples not going to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if your</font>

471
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,000
application receives data using these

472
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,320
schemes they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to send a</font>

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,170
data to your application so you can't

474
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,030
rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them protecting you don't pass</font>

475
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,680
these two queries because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

476
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to end up with query injection in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

477
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,160
application and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really bad</font>

478
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,080
and they also say watch out for social

479
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,210
engineering pretty much everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

480
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,679
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just that I mean there's</font>

481
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing technical in these issues it's</font>

482
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,020
just like a logical flaw so don't

483
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,330
implement useless features developers on

484
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,490
iOS I don't know they seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

485
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,860
like these you're all schemes and they

486
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,330
use them in a weird way so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is P</font>

487
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,639
calc a really popular third-party

488
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,199
calculator for iOS that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpn and is</font>

489
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,950
pretty awesome so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just typing in</font>

490
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,080
some stuff and then I browser page that

491
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,910
does clear all on my calculator why

492
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,980
would I ever need a website to do clear

493
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,640
all on my calculator and that's not

494
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,050
dangerous that's just that's just dumb

495
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,580
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found another one and if you have</font>

496
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,020
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> with flashing lights I would</font>

497
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,629
recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not look for the</font>

498
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">next 20 seconds so there's an app that's</font>

499
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:06,080
a flashlight application that's got a

500
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,190
scheme to trigger a strobe light what's

501
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,649
the use case for that like you really

502
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,660
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw down a party like right</font>

503
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,480
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a link on the website I don't</font>

504
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,520
know what the point is but I spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

505
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,260
Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I message that's</font>

506
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,320
all old stuff right the new hotness is

507
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:25,070
yo so I looked at yo really secure

508
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,629
really useful application and everyone's

509
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,550
using you all right so I just loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

510
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,840
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says invite your friends because that</font>

511
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,720
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so much better I'm like yeah I</font>

512
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,260
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and then I go browse this</font>

513
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,210
website which automatically sends a yo

514
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,879
on my behalf because they just accept

515
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,440
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do it so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just send it to</font>

516
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,470
myself for purposes of the demonstration

517
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,120
and i just sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so if you need to</font>

518
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,250
do naanum eyes anyone who's using yo

519
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,550
that's just one of the many ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

520
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,000
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and what's really dumb is it's</font>

521
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,580
so basic that's

522
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,200
the URL scheme for it you just put

523
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,030
someone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and when they browse</font>

524
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,320
it just sends a yo and there's a guy

525
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,460
who's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-factor authentication</font>

526
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,590
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> yo so after all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> odds we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now have</font>

527
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,180
audio and it's kind of a joke but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

528
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,409
same time some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are like yeah this</font>

529
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cool we should use that for two</font>

530
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,690
factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah don't do that then I started</font>

531
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,750
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some other ways you could use</font>

532
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,750
these 2d anonymize people so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

533
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,550
see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is my mac i'm logged</font>

534
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:27,240
into google apps i'm creating a<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

535
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">docs that i made public on the left you</font>

536
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,070
see my iphone on my iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

537
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,689
logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into google in my browser so</font>

538
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,320
what's interesting is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see these</font>

539
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">things as persistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF attacks right</font>

540
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,950
because people don't log out from

541
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,720
applications no one logs out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

542
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dropbox application on their phones that</font>

543
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,180
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense so what I did</font>

544
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,880
right here is instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sending the</font>

545
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,220
link to the public document i sent a

546
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
link that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the URL scheme for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

547
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,150
google<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive in a google docs</font>

548
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,120
application on iOS so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of opening</font>

549
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,920
it in the browser it opened it in my

550
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,270
application where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm logged in so on</font>

551
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,490
the right it's really small but what you

552
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,930
see in green is my name so again another

553
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you can know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm using</font>

554
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">iOS so what I would say if you're a</font>

555
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,220
developer have you considered that this

556
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,110
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely useless has anyone</font>

557
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,820
in this room really implemented like

558
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">customized workflows using these you're</font>

559
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,060
all schemes there's me and I'm like a

560
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,430
big apple nerd so don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if no</font>

561
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,280
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it or at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least give</font>

562
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,990
the user the option of not enabling that

563
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,160
and leave that off by default you should

564
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an option do you want to</font>

565
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,300
enable these third-party applications to

566
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,850
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> data to your application yes if</font>

567
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,240
someone is enough of a geek to use this

568
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:45,240
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> find your setting if you need</font>

569
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,800
full automation in the flow for example

570
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,510
the day one example I showed where it

571
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,030
just sends you to dropbox and in dropbox

572
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">sends you back have you considered using</font>

573
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,940
a key and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

574
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,730
like the cheapest crappiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF like</font>

575
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,770
token ever or a password so just tell

576
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,200
the user to set up a password that will

577
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,629
be passed in all of these URLs so that

578
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,470
would defeat pretty much all of the web

579
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,720
attacks that

580
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,309
I've demonstrated because that's that's

581
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really targeted so even if it's just</font>

582
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:14,730
one two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

583
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,350
password this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

584
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,360
brute-force over the web page so that

585
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,070
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of all</font>

586
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser to protect you</font>

587
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,939
against this even if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own OS I</font>

588
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,530
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple should know that they've</font>

589
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">been approving applications in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the app</font>

590
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,600
store that have browsers in them so how

591
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,100
do you know an application has a URL

592
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,990
scheme that you might want to exploit

593
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,090
what you can do is download the

594
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">application on your Mac this can work on</font>

595
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,678
pieces well just extract it show the

596
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,309
package content and find the info.plist

597
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,799
file and that's what it looks like so

598
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:49,408
what we see right here is there's a

599
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,870
setting that's declare that says CF

600
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,370
bundle URL schemes and then you know the

601
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,199
application has a scheme but you don't

602
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know what the scheme can do you</font>

603
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,799
know it's there so then you can start

604
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,340
messing with it but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to save</font>

605
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,780
a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Launch</font>

607
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,129
showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier this application has</font>

608
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,750
information about pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much every</font>

609
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,520
application in the app store because

610
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,370
everyone wants to be featured in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

611
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,840
application so in one plist file that

612
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,299
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the same way by extracting</font>

613
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,799
the application you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same</font>

614
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,840
information but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousands of</font>

615
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,330
application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm serious if you look</font>

616
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,059
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for five to ten minutes you will</font>

617
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,860
probably find a vulnerability in an iOS

618
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:32,549
application that just has some crazy

619
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,770
schemes that do crazy stuff there's

620
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,908
other attacks you could do with that

621
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,830
buffer overflow that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

622
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,419
if you want to try buffer overflows

623
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,820
using URL schemes I really recommend

624
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,429
that you google<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick Waldo vartals</font>

625
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,340
talk at source Boston it's available on

626
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:49,590
the web he gave a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tips on</font>

627
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,939
how to reverse engineer iOS applications

628
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,340
and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really useful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

629
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,030
and daniel meyer has a tool called<font color="#CCCCCC"> gid</font>

630
00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,090
be that's on github it automates so many

631
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:02,309
black box pentesting workflows for iOS

632
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,480
one of which is fussing these URL

633
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,030
schemes so if you have a jailbroken

634
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,789
iphone it's just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fuss that run</font>

635
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,500
the application no error code kill the

636
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,000
application and try over and over until

637
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a buffer overflow or a</font>

638
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,500
different kind of issue another thing

639
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,880
that I want to try is sniffing I

640
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,350
mentioned earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these royal</font>

641
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,480
schemes are not unique except for the

642
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,620
default ones what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean</font>

643
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,780
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you know an</font>

644
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,600
application has registered for example

645
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,309
to do column / / you can make your own

646
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,189
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to register the</font>

647
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,480
same stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the latest application</font>

648
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,400
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed is going to receive</font>

649
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,929
that data so if you know the application

650
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,640
is sending sensitive data doing that

651
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:40,380
maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to buy the source</font>

652
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,809
code to one of these crappy flappy bird

653
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,040
clones distribute it but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

654
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:46,649
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data you just send it to</font>

655
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">your server and then no one no one knows</font>

656
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,580
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just stole some</font>

657
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,870
data from iOS users Apple will probably

658
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,439
pull your application but that's going

659
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take a while before I finish a small</font>

660
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,850
note on iOS 8 it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce a</font>

661
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,549
lot of new<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods for inter application</font>

662
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,049
communication which are probably way

663
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,790
more secure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack surface is</font>

664
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,530
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge and one thing to</font>

665
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,659
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the old crappy methods will</font>

666
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,850
still exist tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning iOS 8 is</font>

667
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,030
released this is all still going to

668
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:17,159
exist for a long time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I finish</font>

669
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,020
for questions I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say give a</font>

670
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,450
special thanks to the b-sides mentor

671
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,040
program especially my mentor Brennan who

672
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,830
helped me make this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

673
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,450
better and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you for</font>

674
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,510
your time by showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an actual</font>

675
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:33,179
really useful you all scheme workflow

676
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:37,620
that allows you to google for animated

677
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">gifs yeah i pronounce it gifts and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

678
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">messaged them to your friends</font>

679
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,960
automatically so that's automation for

680
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,460
you so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your time and i</font>

681
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we still have a few minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

682
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:58,350
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes yeah it is they kind of</font>

683
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:00,629
confirmed that they were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

684
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,750
so I'm hoping it's going to be fixed

685
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,280
soon when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told him about the facetime</font>

686
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,440
issue they were working really hard on

687
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,540
iOS 7 which was a major release so it

688
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,580
took time for them to implement the

689
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,960
first fix but I'm confident they will

690
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:20,100
they will do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that we'll</font>

691
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:23,490
see ya safari in 706 is broken 7.1 is

692
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,230
fine but like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using Chrome or</font>

693
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're still vulnerable to that even if</font>

694
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're in incognito mode right because</font>

695
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,850
chrome still sends you to external

696
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,850
applications yes

697
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,650
yes yes so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right</font>

698
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,180
facetime is broken but if you're a

699
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,280
chrome user you're vulnerable to that

700
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:54,030
just making it clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face time</font>

701
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:57,000
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fixed another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one yes yeah it</font>

702
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of random like I tried to test</font>

703
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to be sure it's always the latest</font>

704
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,900
one but in some cases it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the first</font>

705
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">one it it's maybe it's random maybe it's</font>

706
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:11,670
random but it's not always the first one

707
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:13,469
and and some people make like paid

708
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,450
upgrades for their application<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweed but</font>

709
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,100
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tweetbot as its own</font>

710
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,900
scheme and when they released a new

711
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,639
version it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a separate app that also</font>

712
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,740
registered the same scheme and if you

713
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,540
had both apps on your phone it was just

714
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy was always going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the old one</font>

715
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,139
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the new one I don't</font>

716
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any logic behind it or</font>

717
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:46,700
there wasn't in iOS 7.0<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 when I tested</font>

718
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yes yeah well i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

719
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,580
responsibility is and the developers

720
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,190
hands right if you if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

721
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,750
use this you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> careful the new</font>

722
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,110
methods that Apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to provide</font>

723
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,270
in iOS 8 will actually be way more

724
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,889
powerful even for at a functional level

725
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,830
so I think developers will start using

726
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,330
the new stuff so this year we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

727
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,070
less and less your schemes being

728
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,870
implemented in applications and it's

729
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to you know slowly die</font>

730
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:22,020
down yes but if they did that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

731
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:24,389
break a lot of automated workflows which

732
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,740
only a small fraction of users do but

733
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,500
there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few people trying to</font>

734
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">use like iPads to replace laptops and</font>

735
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,230
day-to-day application so until iOS 8

736
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,120
through it was such I don't think Apple

737
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,770
ever intended that to become so popular

738
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,750
but because there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not nothing else</font>

739
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,070
it became popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now they're kind</font>

740
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,100
of stuck with the problem because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

741
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,970
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kill it so we'll see you can</font>

742
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,199
also do white list

743
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,760
if you have an application that should

744
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,789
only receive data from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

745
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,530
application you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but unless</font>

746
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,750
you really know exactly what your users

747
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:58,918
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it for that that's not</font>

748
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:10,230
really a usable solution we still have

749
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:12,240
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one more question I think they</font>

750
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,510
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still be useful for really basic</font>

751
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,340
stuff like the tough on one and who

752
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,039
knows if Apple would deprecated that in

753
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,830
maybe iOS 9 ko's Apple is usually not

754
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:26,570
shy about removing older features so

755
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:33,110
we'll see it could happen could happen

756
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:33,110
any other questions all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
