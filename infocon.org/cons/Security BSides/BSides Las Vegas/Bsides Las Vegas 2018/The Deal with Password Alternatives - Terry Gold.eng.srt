78
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,250
to help advise on on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do where</font>

79
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,750
I'm passwords whether it's physical

80
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,610
security or info info security

81
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,180
alternatives and and we're to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look for</font>

82
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,560
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know I've learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

83
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">but what I've seen is I've seen that</font>

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,330
when Penn tasks or red team's get done

85
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are really</font>

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,290
really really good and they go in and

87
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,829
they find a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of holes whether it's an</font>

88
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,640
energy grid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's exploited and a few</font>

89
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,350
things happen the customer can put their

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,649
head in the sand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say how can this be</font>

91
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,260
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bury it or they're taking</font>

92
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,700
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in and the very smart people that</font>

93
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,070
broke it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be smart they broke</font>

94
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,560
it says it's broken you to fix it and

95
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,690
you need to look at some alternatives

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,739
but just because you're a smart you know

97
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,200
white hat or whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

98
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,510
it a researcher it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,640
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand the depth to</font>

100
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,160
advise an enterprise organization

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,359
whether its energy or defense on how

102
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,400
they're actually to go to spend a few

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,750
million dollars to go do this where it's

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,299
successful people will get fired right

105
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,160
and and so for my job<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the past</font>

106
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,829
several years is I'm a hired mercenary

107
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,510
by these large fortune companies that

108
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,720
take on these initiatives to figure this

109
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,828
out and on the surface it's very easy we

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,620
all know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things look like</font>

111
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,030
what there's a smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> card or a token but</font>

112
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,739
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day all the crap that</font>

113
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,000
goes along behind it the million ways

114
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,530
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wrong that you probably</font>

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,140
will if you just stay at the surface

116
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,719
level you'll do it wrong and heads roll

117
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,419
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here to share my knowledge</font>

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,370
now knowing both sides but<font color="#CCCCCC"> lessons I've</font>

119
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,840
learned over the past 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing</font>

120
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,280
this to help people understand the

121
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,169
technology on<font color="#E5E5E5"> rail around the</font>

122
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,969
alternatives what are the you know what

123
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,530
are the alternatives from passwords

124
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,930
itself let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of break it down so</font>

125
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,030
there's there some fundamentals and then

126
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,430
there's and then their stuff around like

127
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,520
you know obviously what would not my

128
00:04:50,430 --> 00:05:00,590
opinion be around those alternatives and

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:05,099
for some reason this is not not working

130
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:08,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay Microsoft Surface freeze up great</font>

131
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,820
it's a keyboard thing you gotta love it

132
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so well I do this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully it</font>

133
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,890
works so we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those all</font>

134
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms i'll give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion after</font>

135
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,060
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a large a long</font>

136
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,550
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> period of time as to how they</font>

137
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,380
perform how they scale and my bar is how

138
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,970
well are they going to scale because if

139
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,490
they don't scale inside of a large or

140
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,930
you know enterprise then they might work

141
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise but you can't</font>

142
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">really take what you learn from a small</font>

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise and scale it out but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

144
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,840
do the reverse so you go through the

145
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,430
best practices large enterprise and

146
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,150
learn a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and then apply it</font>

147
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,650
in a smaller sandbox this isn't good and

148
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm hoping Microsoft doesn't make me do</font>

149
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,690
a reboot this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible and I</font>

150
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,030
apologize ah me if I just swipe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

151
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,100
it wants a swipe it doesn't want any<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

152
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,530
the swype just kind of got everything

153
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,790
going again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I'm going</font>

154
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take this in three parts and I'm</font>

155
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this really you know I</font>

156
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,210
want to differentiate between identity

157
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,460
and credentialing because a lot of

158
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,260
people think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password is</font>

159
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,010
identity or you got into something so

160
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,090
that's your identity and identity and

161
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,950
credentialing are two separate things

162
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,810
very relevant things so we'll review

163
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,430
that as a fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

164
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,290
be things in here their fundamentals so

165
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,850
some people might get bored but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

166
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,360
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the weeds later on if you</font>

167
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,470
want and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take this from a</font>

168
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,880
vendor neutral approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

169
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,479
mentioning any vendors I don't work for

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,010
a vendor I don't drink the kool-aid most

171
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,200
of my time is spent where vendors

172
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,610
probably hate me so it doesn't make

173
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense to plug them and and really I want</font>

174
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take this from the approach that when</font>

175
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,160
you tackle

176
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,239
a password alternative project that

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,710
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to go through a</font>

178
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level scrutiny on your plans on how</font>

179
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,190
your specking out what resources are

180
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,109
involved how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is going to be</font>

181
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,020
spent so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

182
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,760
time on ryt CEO type of business stuff I

183
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,109
will spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple minutes on it just</font>

184
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,940
give you like a viewpoint if you want to

185
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,290
spend more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on it but all these</font>

186
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,330
projects when you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose</font>

187
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,340
something large scale or critical that's

188
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to work it's got to protect its got</font>

189
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do all these things and we'll talk</font>

190
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,139
about those things it goes through a lot

191
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">of scrutiny because because it involves</font>

192
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,860
many filters many people many types of

193
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources across different management</font>

194
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,250
infrastructure's so it becomes very

195
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,070
challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people lose lose</font>

196
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,770
patience and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font>

197
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,169
the walkway with is out you know I want

198
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,900
you to be able to get through the vendor

199
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,370
kool-aid because all vendors go in and

200
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,260
there's like 200 vendors in this

201
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,640
alternative space pastor alternative

202
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,340
space and they all kind of give their

203
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,930
kool-aid and they really believe it they

204
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,219
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and if they go work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

205
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,290
another company they believe something

206
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,610
different and but the customers they're

207
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own whatever decision they make</font>

208
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,090
so I I know that most people in this

209
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">room are probably independent you</font>

210
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,489
probably don't work for a vendor telling

211
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,950
you what to think we're independent

212
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,720
thinkers so I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

213
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,780
organization say where do I start to

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,669
assess this what might be the right path

215
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,169
for them what might be the right

216
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,570
solution for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's the right</font>

217
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:07,680
process to kind of bring them through to

218
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:10,620
thank them through<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so my</font>

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,890
whole thing is you know i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

220
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,390
review things you already heard of but

221
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,560
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how all these tax are</font>

222
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,950
executed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hear about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the news</font>

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,289
a lot around path or a lot of them have

224
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,200
password elements to them it's not the

225
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,450
only element but it's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

226
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,800
see is a common denominator you know and

227
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,840
so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> even look at like whether</font>

228
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,370
it's a verizon breach report and it's

229
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,978
like most of these breaches involves

230
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,039
some element of password or identity

231
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,680
exploitation and that's a reality so

232
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,120
when i look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what organizations are</font>

233
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,500
doing or what they didn't have in place

234
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm kind of stunned that they haven't</font>

235
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,240
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gotten their act together with</font>

236
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,949
either strengthening<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password other</font>

237
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,650
processes in play or<font color="#E5E5E5"> all their</font>

238
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,670
alternatives and sometimes it can just

239
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,560
be they did ninety percent or

240
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,140
ninety-five percent of it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

241
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,969
three percent the attackers were able to

242
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,930
find where they were vulnerable where

243
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,320
they didn't have it completely

244
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,699
implemented so that's my whole thing to

245
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,130
get people thinking where I'm coming

246
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,980
from now where I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with this is</font>

247
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,960
what's identity because if you're doing

248
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,450
a credentialing program without a

249
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,990
concept of identity you're pretty much

250
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosed in my opinion okay so I want to</font>

251
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,100
take you through that very briefly and

252
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,700
so identity really is separate from a

253
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,530
credential an identity can be where I

254
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,120
would say you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different attributes</font>

255
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,610
that make up a person's identity right

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,070
traits for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance there are things</font>

257
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change I mean arguably</font>

258
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,050
these days through genetic modification

259
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,689
and stuff yes but but generally you know

260
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,819
I color height and all this stuff you're

261
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,180
born with you would have attributes

262
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,070
maybe they get assigned to you last name

263
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and address an employee number of</font>

264
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,020
drivers num license number these are all

265
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">things about you okay these are all</font>

266
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that when you go to an</font>

267
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,870
organization they have the manage and

268
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,100
associate with you and things change and

269
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,350
they have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it applies</font>

270
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you and they have to understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

271
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,030
context and then the thing that really

272
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes identity a lot of work is not just</font>

273
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:15,339
updating the attributes but relationship

274
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,500
I mean think about it as my relationship

275
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,020
my organization changes oh my you know

276
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,810
my role changes which my relationship

277
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,510
may change what I can access or what I

278
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,339
can do or what I should do changes and

279
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,710
so we get into that's really the bulk of

280
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,450
the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> management work is managing</font>

281
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,490
the relationships that I should have in

282
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,130
the entitlements that I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and</font>

283
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,850
it has nothing to do with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

284
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,860
that I'm assigned yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or the token</font>

285
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,270
that that you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me but what happens</font>

286
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is is you know roles change</font>

287
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,319
relationships changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's</font>

288
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,110
this whole other thing that takes a full

289
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,630
in effect program it's a separate

290
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,670
program but it's a focus program the

291
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:58,960
credential I look at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proof behind</font>

292
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,969
all that so once i have the identity

293
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,040
lockdown and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm managing the</font>

294
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,900
relationships and the entitlements the

295
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,769
credential is the representation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Who</font>

296
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,769
I am to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute a challenge</font>

297
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,959
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to prove who i am and it's</font>

298
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,999
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the program who is managing</font>

299
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,170
program to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's either a</font>

300
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:20,339
strong or a weak challenge response<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

301
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,540
and i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure i'm really going to go</font>

302
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,290
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this because my</font>

303
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,420
animation isn't working so well it is if

304
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,009
I swipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I point here is that you</font>

305
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,839
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a commercial organization</font>

306
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:34,049
enterprise and i would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

307
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're you walk in with existing</font>

308
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:38,040
identity attributes already right so i

309
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,110
have a twitter account of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook</font>

310
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,730
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a driver's license</font>

311
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,980
they're all disconnected but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

312
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,540
all things that identify me and why

313
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,459
that's you know kind of interesting

314
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,498
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go to HR they want me to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font>

315
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,899
who i am even though they kind of know I

316
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:53,519
show for my first day of work right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

317
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,989
they want what do they want they want a

318
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,429
driver's license they want a bank

319
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:57,779
account number they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put you in</font>

320
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:59,069
payroll they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a background</font>

321
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,350
check to make sure it's your bank

322
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:03,029
account your payroll all this stuff so

323
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,230
you carry these third-party things that

324
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,480
are already assigned to you into the

325
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,249
enterprise they piggyback off them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

326
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,079
then they put you in whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

327
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:12,540
performance management system talent

328
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,040
talent management system payroll now you

329
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,498
have separate identities within their

330
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,040
system and then they tell hey I t he

331
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:21,899
needs access right so they'll tell tlit

332
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,189
that you know to set you up to get you

333
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to what you need according your</font>

334
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:29,248
role and now you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ad you're in</font>

335
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:30,569
disconnected applications and you have

336
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,549
and this is where you have the problem

337
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,809
where some people have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

338
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:35,579
different identities inside of an

339
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,199
organization so it takes work and then

340
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,008
physical access is a whole different

341
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,889
story because that's usually

342
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:42,240
disconnected right so so that's the

343
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">story with identity is it's completely</font>

344
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,509
separate now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in and say</font>

345
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,239
okay well credentialing let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

346
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,160
credentialing part what credentialing is

347
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,629
appropriate well I gotta look at the

348
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,189
risk i gotta look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

349
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,139
doing it they're just accessing a lobby

350
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:59,639
well they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an rfid card</font>

351
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and doesn't really probably need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

352
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,819
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong one you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> argue with me</font>

353
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,829
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting in</font>

354
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lobby right but you know if they're</font>

355
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:09,959
getting access to a data center or let's

356
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:13,049
just say they're getting access to an

357
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,939
HSM the person that manages h SMS where

358
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,110
all your crypto keys are stored I mean

359
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:18,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> better make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

360
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,379
really strong credential so not

361
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,450
everybody in the whole organization

362
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,450
needs a strongest credential

363
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,890
next right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font>

364
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the stronger you go the more</font>

365
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,520
complex the more expensive it is and I

366
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,410
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend according to my risk</font>

367
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,880
because I can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just go ahead</font>

368
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,150
and spend millions all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place</font>

369
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,500
and and overspend but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

370
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,480
about the technology and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

371
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail it's about how you proof</font>

372
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,950
that identity how do I upon enrollment

373
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,140
know that it's a right person being

374
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,260
enrolled what's my process to ensure

375
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how strong is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge when</font>

376
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,220
somebody busts out that credential to

377
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,709
authenticate how strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

378
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,250
challenge in terms of how well it can be

379
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,920
manipulated forged or otherwise and then

380
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,060
the response you know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a response</font>

381
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,130
is it symmetric key is an asymmetric and

382
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,510
and then the validation part of it right

383
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,600
so there's all sorts of validation

384
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,030
processes and trust models that will get

385
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that how much trust do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put in</font>

386
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,650
that credential so and all this is a lot

387
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,420
of processed policy involves you know

388
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,000
what type of crypto using who's

389
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,099
performing the background check<font color="#CCCCCC"> our is</font>

390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,690
there an anchor of trust right is there

391
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,050
a practice statement where they audited

392
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,760
so the world of just issuing a one-time

393
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,040
password token it sounds great on the

394
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,140
surface<font color="#CCCCCC"> but a lot of times they're void</font>

395
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,390
of all this which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine for the</font>

396
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,850
application that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing but it may</font>

397
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it takes individual analysis</font>

398
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,060
across the spectrum of your assets to

399
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,040
find out really<font color="#E5E5E5"> which one is appropriate</font>

400
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,219
and that's separate from does vendor a

401
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,689
do it better than vendor be right that

402
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,160
just comes down to the premise of the

403
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,640
type of technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the general</font>

404
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,050
policy that I require all right I'm

405
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,920
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip through things and I'll</font>

406
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,479
take more questions things that we'll

407
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about a little bit more i'm going</font>

408
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,830
to get into the types of credentials in

409
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,350
a second but when i mentioned about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

410
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,200
process the policy a lot of it comes

411
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,030
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this stuff right so how are you</font>

412
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,520
going to vet the person that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

413
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,110
them when they enroll but wholesome when

414
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,990
they come in when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you issue and</font>

415
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,490
distribute their credential to them

416
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,870
because maybe it's not maybe their

417
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,060
gaming you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not maybe they're</font>

418
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,930
getting you to distribute the credential

419
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,300
to

420
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a rogue use or even though is a real</font>

421
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,359
person that enrolled and you need to

422
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's pretty tight if</font>

423
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,760
you have high security stuff going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

424
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the adjudication piece background</font>

425
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,439
watchdog checks that's sometimes that's

426
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,029
critical like hey they pass a background

427
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,830
check and we vetted them when they first

428
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,110
came into goth or credential but three

429
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,270
months later they got picked up for some

430
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,890
crime and you know so so it's always

431
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of maybe some organizations have</font>

432
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,779
this rolling automation of a background

433
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">check that goes out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to federal systems</font>

434
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:09,360
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but they're</font>

435
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,980
not anymore and then you have secure

436
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,540
issuance where you know when you're

437
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,000
provisioning the keys or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

438
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,949
key ceremony or anything like that that

439
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication between the</font>

440
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,740
authoritative source and the keystore

441
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,260
down to the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client or the device</font>

442
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,110
itself can't be compromised which is why

443
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know all these upstart companies</font>

444
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,290
that just say oh no big deal you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

445
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,209
really need this infrastructure new key

446
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,709
management and they just be like at all

447
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do is kind of like this you know</font>

448
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,160
Pete<font color="#CCCCCC"> will file and you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

449
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,750
offload this p12 file and you put the

450
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,969
key in the device it's like that is not

451
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">very secure and if you have a lot of</font>

452
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the issuance I don't</font>

453
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it right so you need</font>

454
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,320
infrastructure and you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

455
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that points upon issuance delivery and</font>

456
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,120
activation are very secure perhaps maybe

457
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> determined doesn't but I'm going</font>

458
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this end because you can always go</font>

459
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,270
backwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I'm coming from</font>

460
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,439
right so and then it's the application

461
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,029
security the product itself which

462
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,199
everybody's familiar with because

463
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">security products don't always mean that</font>

464
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:07,260
the product itself isn't secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

465
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,050
though the functions try to deliver it

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">and life cycle life cycles huge when you</font>

of QA with vendors and how they do

481
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,610
things and i can tell you you know in

482
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,950
the mobile world a lot of more assuming

483
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,250
that oh we have helpdesk automation for

484
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,690
that

485
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,880
device to get your virtual credential

486
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,740
back and most of the time it's based on

487
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that it's the same sim in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

488
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,540
same number that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look for and</font>

489
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,570
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no like a intermediate approval</font>

490
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,010
or delegation and they eat but if you're

491
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">a large-scale enterprise you're going to</font>

492
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,180
face all these things people lost their

493
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,709
phone somebody took their sim they

494
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,450
dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> their phone it broke it's in the</font>

495
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,680
bottom of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> river I don't know but</font>

496
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,410
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want all these help</font>

497
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,790
desk calls all the time and those help

498
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,700
desk calls start to turn into

499
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:20,820
spearfishing calls and so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

500
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,020
lot of that lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

501
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let's go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

502
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,160
basics is the basic stuff something you

503
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,920
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what that is</font>

504
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:33,000
generally it's going to be a password or

505
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,160
pin or question based answer response

506
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and answer and all these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

507
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">know based on memory and I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

508
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,450
know that they have flaws<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font>

509
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,770
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that passwords will I don't</font>

510
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,780
think they'll ever go away and I'm not

511
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,090
justifying their existence it's just

512
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,940
they come with the application at least

513
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">this day and age there for free right so</font>

514
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,690
if you go by if you can buy an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle</font>

515
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,310
database guess what you're getting

516
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,890
password functionality for free in that

517
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,139
database and Oracle's just unwilling at

518
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,390
this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to do anything else</font>

519
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,920
out of the box that scales across any

520
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,960
other they see there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

521
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,130
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> so guess what password is</font>

522
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,810
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for a long time they</font>

523
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">just will and you can decide whether</font>

524
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,810
they they're still in play they're still

525
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,820
in play for different audiences or

526
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,280
applications but the reality in my

527
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,439
opinion is we we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move beyond</font>

528
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,389
passwords for some of our assets and

529
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
groups of users because we have

530
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,930
different levels of risk and that's

531
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,770
where I'm coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay so I'm</font>

532
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to skip over that because you've</font>

533
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,240
got two days that something you are

534
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,200
biometrics basically it's a biometric

535
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,660
and come in all forms iris facial palm

536

rate heartbeats and there's a on the

538
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,490
surface they look like they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holy</font>

anything but you and how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forge</font>

541
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,350
something unique to you but i can tell

542
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you i work for about the one of the</font>

leading biometric companies and i can

544
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,010
tell you there's a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this technology that is flawed that</font>

546
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:00,179
doesn't get press so it was pretty funny

547
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,480
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's challenges out</font>

there

549
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,860
like apple or there was a who was it

550
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenged somebody to break the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

551
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,540
iphone biometrics people are spoofing

552
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,150
and they proved they could spoof the

553
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">finger but there's a much easier path to</font>

554
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,549
this that people didn't take I'll sit

555
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,139
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and we'll cover why</font>

556
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,059
biometrics in some cases I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

557
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,790
good but you change the contacts and

558
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,440
they're terrible and I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just expose</font>

559
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,899
you to the facts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

560
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,510
decide for yourself but in in in a

561
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,190
general sense one big problem is you

562
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,410
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no revocation so I mean if somehow</font>

563
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,809
my template and I'll explain how they

564
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,100
work in a minute my template gets

565
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,320
compromised I can't create another

566
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,520
finger I can't derive another template

567
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,168
from the same finger it's going to be

568
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,210
the same template that was compromised I

569
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,730
only have so many heartbeat signatures

570
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,860
probably one I would imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't get</font>

571
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,690
to enroll different heartbeats and so

573
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,410
whenever you can't revoke a credential I

574
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,059
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you really have a secure</font>

575
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,220
model because once it's compromised your

576
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,240
you are completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> screwed and there's a</font>

577
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,480
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other problems with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

technology the short stories are great

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get into that will do kind of a</font>

583
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,809
something you have all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,179
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that could be you know an RSA</font>

go to be 29 and you read off the numbers

594
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,240
it's cheap it fits in your wallet is a

ten-dollar token you're just printing

597
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:55,500
out paper so anyway not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font>

598
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you have some organizations</font>

599
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,650
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to just say hey your</font>

bank already knows who you are just use

601
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:07,350
your bank or ATM card scary but it's

602
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening okay along with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know using</font>

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,400
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea but okay</font>

605
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,620
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit of the</font>

606
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,400
components about life cycle before i get

607
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,469
into reviewing the technologies because

608
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,140
the technologies itself are dependent on

609
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,490
whether they can do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff</font>

610
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,440
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're thinking about a project for</font>

611
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,080
alternatives the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake that</font>

612
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,970
I've seen people make and I've done this

613
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,490
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of many many large organizations</font>

614
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,160
for the past 15 years is they head right

615
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,050
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology in the device I think</font>

616
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,210
one time password I love this device

617
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:43,310
from Vasco you push the<font color="#CCCCCC"> button and at C</font>

618
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,120
to F and I'll do this and that's what we

619
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,710
need stop or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they need a</font>

620
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,689
smart card make Google who make smart

621
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,310
cards and they get the vendor in there

622
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,930
and the vendor just wants to sell smart

623
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,250
cards they don't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

624
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,290
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should know and you</font>

625
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,970
wouldn't know them yet right they don't

626
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about keys and key ownership and</font>

627
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,950
integration and all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

628
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,300
everything everything works right so the

629
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,980
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you really have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

630
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,590
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your business process well</font>

631
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,970
first I loathe is outcomes what do you

632
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,379
want to achieve out of this so it comes

633
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,640
from stakeholders and what are you

634
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,800
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare what are your assets</font>

635
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,720
what are the outcomes but from a

636
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,490
technical standpoint I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

637
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,750
understand this stuff you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how is</font>

638
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,180
this going to integrate like back in

639
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,920
systems whether it's you know help desk

640
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,140
from remedy how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to integrate</font>

641
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,960
how's it going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate with my IDM</font>

642
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">a soror ad is it going to impose schema</font>

643
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,040
extensions an ad that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't</font>

644
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,390
want to go through my I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

645
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,520
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through but I haven't even</font>

646
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,500
talked to them yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

647
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and say great i get a</font>

648
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,250
great deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this this shiny new thing</font>

649
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I thought we needed but it comes</font>

650
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,180
with a two-million-dollar dependency

651
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,399
that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that we have</font>

652
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,610
to do to upgrade or something to execute

653
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,340
it or I've seen this happen they buy

654
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,870
50,000 of these devices as a vendor sold

655
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,459
it on them and they stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the shelf</font>

656
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,409
and collect us because it wouldn't work

657
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,330
with their back-end system I've seen it

658
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,950
happen just stays are on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shelf not</font>

659
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,740
good you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be so you want to</font>

660
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,130
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to figure out the lifecycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

661
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,510
type of events are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to experience</font>

662
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,680
from locking the device losing the

663
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,990
device how you're going to get it to

664
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,600
them are highly distributed and do the

665
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:20,450
workflows to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have that as an</font>

666
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,639
interface or a process support the life

667
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,170
cycle and I do you get reporting

668
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,840
throughout that life cycle to have an

669
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">audit trail</font>

670
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,129
things got issued who issued it a lot of

671
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">these products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe it or not</font>

672
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,600
so some of the issues are credential man

673
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,189
i really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know who could have the</font>

674
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,809
ability to issue this credential did it

675
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,110
get activated when did it get activated

676
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,850
I want to know this right see it's all

677
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,408
this stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems logical but is</font>

678
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,209
missed when we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about it</font>

679
00:24:43,409 --> 00:24:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">prudential and you know your</font>

680
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,960
infrastructure the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of integration</font>

681
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,610
and of course all the security stuff

682
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,090
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it's not just</font>

683
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:57,090
about the device it's about dependent

684
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,620
systems it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it's about the</font>

685
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,270
distribution so if you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

686
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,239
devices from a third party like a token

687
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,100
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> manufactures a token what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

688
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,600
manufacturing process how do they

689
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,918
protect their keys who has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

690
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,070
that manufacturing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so it's not a</font>

691
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,500
cloud but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I order tokens from ABC</font>

692
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,809
company I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

693
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,429
process isn't compromised because at the

694
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,529
end of the day they have my seeds that i

695
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,159
lo and load into my server before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

696
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:24,720
them or whether it's it's other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

697
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,750
so you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about these things</font>

698
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,020
because they they're really something to

699
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,480
think about in a flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how you might</font>

700
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,480
issue an advanced credential you might

701
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,340
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vetting process okay so it</font>

702
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,279
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like a government-issued ID</font>

703
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,500
that gets leveraged references a bank

704
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,289
bank verification the bank I'll rivetted

705
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,399
you some type of crediting licensing

706
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,620
boards already put you through the

707
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">wringer and then so the part you will go</font>

708
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say can we trust it we're</font>

709
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to we're going to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

710
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,299
issue you one of these right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

711
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use it we might go ahead and do a</font>

00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:00,809
live interview do some background checks

713
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,158
is all optional and then we're going to

714
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,230
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do binding a Jew to</font>

715
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,750
adjudication you have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in person</font>

716
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,220
you have to do a bio before we hand it

717
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,110
over and you have to activate it in

718
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,899
person or you do it remotely so these

719
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,219
intermediate steps of making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

720
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,360
you were the person rolled now I'm going

721
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,159
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you and allow you to do</font>

722
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,149
that deviation but then you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

723
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,460
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usage part right you might</font>

724
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:26,639
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a remote activation and then of</font>

course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of have these other</font>

can authenticate but it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will you want to provide self</font>

some level

service but it better be secure or

733
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,689
choose what parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

736
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,950
scenario the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i'll talk a</font>

737
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,970
little bit about what i call relying

738
00:26:52,950 --> 00:27:01,980
parties and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDPs who's heard of</font>

739
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:03,510
relying parties that term and RTP so you

740
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,710
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional sense we think</font>

741
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:10,590
of ABC organization issuing credentials

742
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,850
to their employee and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that's</font>

743
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,290
that's a way it flows and that is a

744
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,530
traditional model when you think of like

745
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know giving RSA tokens people you</font>

746
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,129
know in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network but the end of the</font>

747
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,260
day it could be where you know you have

748
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,240
another organization that you are doing

749
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">business with that has their own set of</font>

requirements for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your employees access</font>

751
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,020
our system right and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

752
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,000
relying party and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

753
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,160
be the issuer so you have the issuer you

754
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,620
know the relying party and a lot of

755
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">times the most of the time in the models</font>

756
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,850
that we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the the relying</font>

757
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,550
party the issuer have to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same and</font>

758
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,580
it creates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of burden right but you</font>

759
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,720
have new models coming out where the the

760
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,300
relying party doesn't have to be the

761
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,610
issuer right and either you have some

762
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,290
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard core interoperability to get</font>

763
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,020
there like how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard a</font>

764
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,300
pip it's a government spec for smart

765
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,910
cards how many perv common access card

766
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:06,659
kak right so everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody the</font>

767
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:08,370
military whether your DoD army navy they

768
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,410
have a card with a chip in it right

769
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a cat card the next generation is</font>

770
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,190
a pivot and the whole premise behind the

771
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,650
PIP card is interoperable so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

772
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,390
issued a certificate from a CA<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

773
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the department certification</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Authority</font>

774
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,180
then there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> department that can</font>

775
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:28,020
go ahead and validate that that it's

776
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,030
valid and call the ocsp because at the

777
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,010
federal bridge level they have some

778
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,600
chain of trust between them so they're

779
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,040
not issuing from the same CA<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they're</font>

780
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,990
chained their trust and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're</font>

781
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,120
certified to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that highly</font>

782
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,130
complex not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would advise a</font>

783
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,600
commercial enterprise really doing it's

784
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not there yet there's other ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

785
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,800
potentially get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I'm going to</font>

786
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into each technology for a few</font>

787
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,700
minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

788
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,340
little bit about

789
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,289
project stuff before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about each</font>

790
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,820
technology and give you my opinion we

791
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:02,039
can make this a discussion and you have

792
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:05,309
questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever is how do you</font>

793
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:08,590
sniff out the BS and what's the BS

794
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:10,570
filter for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor pitch around I the</font>

795
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,340
latest greatest thing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a</font>

796
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,350
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of elements but here are some key</font>

797
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,370
elements and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find is an</font>

798
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,439
analyst I go do requirements for<font color="#CCCCCC"> large</font>

799
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">scale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and users by the way I forgot to</font>

800
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,159
tell you this is all posted online in my

801
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,408
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole deck with notes and</font>

802
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,019
and I'll it sits on my website you go to

803
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,639
d6 research and go to resources and

804
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:33,100
sprint their password password is con

805
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:34,539
2016 and if i'll go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the original</font>

806
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,010
side give you the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's all there</font>

807
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,460
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to take photos you can if</font>

808
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:41,679
you want it's all there for you so and

809
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,809
what I say is there's a best practice

810
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,850
model where things are open and I like

811
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:47,110
open stuff not because it's cool not

812
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,870
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i should get everything</font>

813
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,299
for free but when things are open you

814
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,559
put it out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for peer review</font>

815
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:55,480
everybody gets to kick its tail around

816
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,029
and tell you how good or how bad it is

817
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,350
and that feedback comes in and it goes

818
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,720
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a process where everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wants</font>

819
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,490
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and everybody's taken the</font>

820
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,649
bus to the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location so somebody</font>

821
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,210
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a comment and the community</font>

822
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:09,850
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for everybody</font>

823
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,529
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna call an obscurity model</font>

824
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,719
where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't tell me what crypto</font>

825
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,100
algorithm they're using I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

826
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,710
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that would come potentially</font>

827
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,389
compromised my my solution well tell you

828
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">what telling me your algorithm or how</font>

829
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:23,500
you manage keys should not compromise a

830
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,620
security solution you should be able to

831
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,110
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me everything but the private key</font>

832
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,299
all right or the files it to reconstruct

833
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,490
a master key but you I wouldn't ask for

834
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:35,918
right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want i would want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

835
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:39,039
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you have built</font>

836
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:43,330
your solution how you manage it your

837
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,158
custodial responsibilities and here's

838
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,710
generally what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say the good</font>

839
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,299
responses are right and here are the

840
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:53,470
ones i typically get where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say okay</font>

841
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:56,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what deals over we pretty much</font>

842
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,630
eliminated yourself because you this

843
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,158
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here i can tell you can not</font>

844
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,529
just be broken but once it is it's not

845
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem the</font>

obscurity model right

847
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,169
and model you can always iterate in fix

848
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,639
everybody's getting on the same vasca

849
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,500
the same location<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's open you'll</font>

850
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,630
probably catch that stuff before the

851
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,370

00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,870
once you compromise it it's broken

853
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,179
because they didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right in the</font>

854
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a problem and so</font>

855
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,160
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take a look at all the technologies</font>

856
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,320
i can think of everything from access

857
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,920
cards from physical access and barcodes

858
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,659
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki certificates and you know i</font>

859
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,760
think about how strong they are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

860
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,860
did this a couple years ago to kind of

861
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,410
just start doodling around and you know

862
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,000
thinking through things and doing the

863
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,040
assessment of all these technologies how

864
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,670
strong they were and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> their security</font>

865
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,230
models were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't know I wasn't sure</font>

866
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:51,640
where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going but it dawned on me</font>

867
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:53,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what happens is that all the</font>

868
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,760
weak ones down here if you notice that

869
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">they really aren't big on standards just</font>

870
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,250
coincidence right and the ones that are

871
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,980
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong tend to be more in the</font>

872
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,170
standards bucket and again I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

873
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that peer review if it sucks</font>

874
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,110
people are going to sniff it out it's

875
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,140
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to scale it'll get</font>

876
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,550
fixed it gets vetted right but time you

877
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,110
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their problems with sha-1</font>

878
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,840
it's already on<font color="#CCCCCC"> shot too you know what</font>

879
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:21,790
I'm saying so that's very very important

880
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to go through</font>

881
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,560
some some of these and then get a few

882
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:30,780
points in on some business off and take

883
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,550
questions but proximity cards for

884
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,750
physical access a lot of times stink how

885
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,940
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been to talks around</font>

886
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,220
breaking proximity card and stuff or

887
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,860
you've caught one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talks and right</font>

888
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,190
there are some proximity cards that are

889
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,070
strong okay that that have not yet been

890
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:51,190
hacked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of that that and I</font>

891
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">peek behind the covers pretty deeply and</font>

892
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,560
it's a matter of time perhaps but but

893
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:59,020
right now they're much stronger to the

894
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,030
point of not associating with maybe the

895
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,010
talks that you've seen where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've seen</font>

896
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get exploited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I point that out</font>

897
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:07,420
to not put them all in one<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucket but</font>

898
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,700
here's the thing even those highly

899
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,260
secure cards which are the minority the

900
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,080
time that you might encounter and an

901
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,658
enterprise are terrible for

902
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,699
authenticating to IT systems

903
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,830
context changes everything and the

904
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:28,139
reason is because embedded within that

905
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:31,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">rfid card is a vendor program numerical</font>

906
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:36,299
character in binary right so let's just

907
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">say they encoded a nine-digit number</font>

908
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:42,789
right it's you know it's a number she's

909
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,739
numerical format that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

910
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:48,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's all it is now might be encrypted</font>

911
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:49,479
but here's a thing in the system the

912
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:52,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">system has to know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number it is</font>

913
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:54,399
after its encrypted so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

914
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,139
that's stored without an encryption that

915
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,508
that is actually figuring out how to

916
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:59,678
authenticate it right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

917
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:02,739
the number that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an active</font>

918
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,259
directory number one number two the

919
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:09,280
source of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issuing that number is being</font>

920
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:10,839
used in physical access software and the

921
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,700
physical access software generally and I

922
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,529
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you for a fact for me to go get</font>

923
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,808
into an organization and get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

924
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,909
access control system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start peeking</font>

925
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">around understanding what somebody's</font>

926
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,500
card access number is without the

927
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:25,750
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> not terribly hard so i can</font>

928
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,819
find weaker points to get that number in

929
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,739
an unencrypted form and reapply it and

930
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:31,449
now what am I left with I'm left with

931
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,270
everything I don't want to do I'm left

932
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:37,178
with I'm left with a number that's

933
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,668
encoded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor a vendor default</font>

934
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:42,520
which is actually goes against a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

935
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,949
audit policies for good reason i'm left

936
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,059
with somebody else coded it encoded and

937
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,308
they have a record of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and i have no</font>

938
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:50,230
axe no idea how they're managing those

939
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:53,169
cassuto relationships or those records

940
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,089
that's pretty bad a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times they</font>

941
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,250
actually encode the number right on the

942
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,558
back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card bad practice for a</font>

943
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,809
different reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get into but I</font>

944
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,869
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it my whole password policy</font>

945
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:07,119
of changing password every 30 60 90 days

946
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I no control over that anymore because</font>

947
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,859
it's hard coded into the into the card

948
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,720
and I there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no process of changing so</font>

949
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,609
everything I thought I was getting to go

950
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a more secure model I'm actually</font>

951
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:19,000
taking a step back from where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was and</font>

952
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:22,359
being able to manage pastor obviously

953
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,920
passwords are better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID cards for</font>

954
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:25,920
IT security yeah

955
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:35,500
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change them you can't</font>

956
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the password what's up the</font>

957
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,809
question was am I saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that passwords</font>

958
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:44,829
are better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID cards because RFID</font>

959
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:47,650
cards you can't because you can change

960
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,930
the password you have a password policy

961
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:53,260
and I was saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes because if you have</font>

962
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,480
a credential like like<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a you have a</font>

963
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,910
password policy that you could impose

964
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,799
changing every 30 60 90 days all right

965
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,319
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is but then you implement</font>

966
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:04,420
a credential that has a password because

967
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,549
it's a password in that credential and I

968
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,140
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never change it at all and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

969
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:09,730
make it alphanumeric and I can't apply

970
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,930
any of the policies that I previously

971
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:16,180
had I would say stay with your previous

972
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:18,368
policy because at the end of the day the

973
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:22,089
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> process has no idea that</font>

974
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:27,640
you're using a card it's just reading

975
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:29,589
that that sequential numeric string it's

976
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,650
a serial number yeah it's encrypted

977
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:35,319
serial number with a obscure format and

978
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:38,349
I and the in its not doing any type of

979
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,609
you know random number generator process

980
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:41,380
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have the device</font>

981
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:43,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just basically guy you have</font>

982
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,000
that matching number it's terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

983
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,130
just takes you a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

984
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,799
I wrote a paper on this it's on my

985
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,940
website and I saw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of organizations</font>

986
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:53,589
doing this because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

987
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,240
cards they already had and since you

988
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,279
can't it has a chip and you can't see it

989
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,299
all these companies were doing I said I

990
00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:00,609
mean you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta know what you're</font>

991
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:06,160
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into so anyway that's that's a</font>

992
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:10,299
story without oh boy biometrics how many

993
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here like biometrics song keep ya</font>

994
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:15,819
like to break<font color="#CCCCCC"> up like the break so</font>

995
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:18,730
biometrics for me is is an interesting

996
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,990
topic because I worked for a biometric

997
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,400
company and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

998
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,899
them but what I'll say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

999
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,520
biometrics is there's a lot of problems

1000
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,039
and again I have a paper on this you go

1001
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,440
check it out it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all kind of</font>

1002
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,940
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

1003
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,859
they're two types of biometrics one's

1004
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,440
called a 'this which actually does a

1005
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:37,509
live scan and a and it's a real

1006
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,560
photograph of your finger and that's

1007
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,140
used for law enforcement

1008
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,759
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when you see like CSI</font>

1009
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,440
and the animal is blooming veep no

1010
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,640
systems really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work like that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

1011
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,160
of amazing they've always sound effects

1012
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,740
but really what's used for

1013
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,440
authentication is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a template which is</font>

1014
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,810
a mathematical representation so it

1015
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,370
you'll do a scan of your finger<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

1016
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:01,210
interpret that all the data points in

1017
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:03,310
the ridges in how that software and

1018
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,620
algorithm does the interpretation which

1019
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,450
is unique from vendor to vendor what's

1020
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,880
unique around the vendors by the way is

1021
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,759
is that the algorithm and how they

1022
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,670
interpret those data points and it gets

1023
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,560
into a mathematical representation much

1024
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,470
like the the godly group you would see

1025
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,299
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki certificate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and what it</font>

1026
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">does is the next time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go ahead</font>

1027
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply a live finger it recalls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1028
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,270
reference template that was enrolled and

1029
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,420
compares them and every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

1030
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,580
that its a math it's a mathematics thing

1031
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,470
it's it's not security<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's mathematics</font>

1032
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,480
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out does this</font>

1033
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,270
blob match this current real-time

1034
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,480
interpretation and inside of that

1035
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,009
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always right all the time in</font>

1036
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,560
every biometric system there's a false

1037
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,260
except in a false eject false reject

1038
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,060
rate and you typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> have controlled</font>

1039
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,270
with you want to have more false except

1040
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:58,840
sand more false rejects you get to tune

1041
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:01,060
it but you can't up both it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1042
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,670
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so if you're an</font>

1043
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,110
organization where you can't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

1044
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,200
those false success or false rejects

1045
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,960
ever you can add a third factor or maybe

1046
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,730
biometrics isn't for you right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1047
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've seen bugs in some of these</font>

1048
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,350
these biometrics products where if you

1049
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,379
put your<font color="#CCCCCC"> finger in a certain part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1050
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,640
sensor then it throws the algorithm off

1051
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,250
and it's like that yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them in</font>

1052
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,259
so it's sometimes not that good right

1053
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,780
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with biometrics that</font>

1054
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's natively most</font>

1055
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,040
applications in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT world don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1056
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,990
what a biometric is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't know</font>

1057
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,640
they know what a password is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of box</font>

1058
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,470
they don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> two biometric as the</font>

1059
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,910
applications are learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font>

1060
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,919
certificate is but they don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1061
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,660
biometrics is so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do the</font>

1062
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,100
biometrics vendor is that you buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1063
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,620
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you must deploy this</font>

1064
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,529
middleware client this middleware client

1065
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically stores a reference</font>

1066
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,290
template

1067
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,149
to compare to live finger it also

1068
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">contains logic do the comparison in</font>

1069
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:01,430
runtime and then it also has another

1070
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,690
component that takes your existing

1071
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,049
password that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get off</font>

1072
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,930
of and encrypts it in stores it in a

1073
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,540
local cache and software and then when I

1074
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,940
do a successful match it will decrypt

1075
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,820
that cash and send that password back to

1076
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,619
the application for<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication so</font>

1077
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,200
all I'm doing is I'm adding a layer of

1078
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,619
abstraction but all my back-end systems

1079
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,330
are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on that password</font>

1080
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:27,619
what did I saw I didn't solve the

1081
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,049
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back end which is a lot</font>

1082
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,910
of my big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem you know if I'm going</font>

1083
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,200
to go ahead and and so anyway there's a

1084
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,868
lot of problems till you're still in a

1085
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">password paradigm it's very expensive it</font>

1086
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,900
doesn't do encryption it doesn't do a

1087
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,900
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do right</font>

1088
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so there's three things around</font>

1089
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,080
crocheting yeah so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password</font>

1090
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:56,840
is going to get encrypted in a local

1091
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:00,049
cache for use upon when you have a say

1092
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:02,119
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> except right and it's going to pass</font>

1093
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:05,500
that to the application and typically

1094
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:09,680
that that that that middle we're is is

1095
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:11,270
implementing its own process of how it

1096
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,549
deals with that process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font>

1097
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,530
encrypting the password that's one part

1098
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other part is do they encrypt the</font>

1099
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,280
template because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody takes my</font>

1100
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,509
template<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get into that whole</font>

1101
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,180
revocation model that I talked about

1102
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the other part</font>

1103
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,040
where I care about authentication but

1104
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,649
the end of the day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really do not care</font>

1105
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,210
about protecting my data and I may want

1106
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,040
to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine I want to</font>

1107
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,420
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do full disk encryption I</font>

1108
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,050
want to encrypt the stuff that's

1109
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,910
critical biometrics don't do that now

1110
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get fancy with biometrics where</font>

1111
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,930
they they add elements in there but

1112
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,300
inherently the technology just doesn't

1113
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,700
do that because it's not key based its

1114
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,240
mathematical based and all these vendors

1115
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,589
in the in the biometrics world the

1116
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,439
conversations I have with them are

1117
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,840
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> their mathematicians or their</font>

1118
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,810
marketing because their whole business

1119
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,970
is building great algorithms or as great

1120
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:10,430
as they can

1121
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:11,779
and and and and with that they don't

1122
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really they don't focus on security</font>

1123
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,560
they're not people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that understand</font>

1124
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,419
application security very much but they

1125
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,580
certainly know how to market to the

1126
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,710
security market based on the fact this

1127
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,930
can only be you but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the</font>

1128
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,930
peel back the layers that's a challenge

1129
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:34,009
so are you suggesting then that anyone

1130
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,380
using biometrics should use the

1131
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,810
biometrics not to grant access to

1132
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,570
anything but a key as part of an

1133
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:44,480
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> good Russian good question or</font>

1134
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:46,630
yes or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say if you want to</font>

1135
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,490
use biometrics use it for identification

1136
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,050
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not authentication because</font>

1137
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,569
identification systems typically

1138
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,880
understand what a biometric is its kind

1139
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of native and you could say for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

1140
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,160
if I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and use one</font>

1141
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,259
credential but that that process doesn't

1142
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,240
check whether I'm the right holder that

1143
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,550
credential the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maya metra can help do</font>

1144
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,080
that yes I had the right person they

1145
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,780
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right credentials see you can</font>

1146
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,540
use both but you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be advising an</font>

1147
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,119
organization is resistant to doing three

1148
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:20,800
factor right so that's why smartcards

1149
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,210
use a pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and and the pin you up</font>

1150
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,680
policy behind a pin that's good i'm not

1151
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,900
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this as physical</font>

1152
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,279
access sort of cards data stuff and

1153
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,109
enemy wants to talk to you about the

1154
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,119
payload that's on there we can do that

1155
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:33,980
later so one time password tokens

1156
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:37,250
everybody knows who what that is right

1157
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:40,280
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure whether it's SMS on a</font>

1158
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,720
mobile phone or token and they're

1159
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,310
they're pretty good the challenge with

1160
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,560
that is that they don't do encryption

1161
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,270
they won't do windows login they won't

1162
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,040
do full disk encryption they won't do

1163
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,320
ask mine there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things they</font>

1164
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,359
won't do they'll do VPN or web apps

1165
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,099
pretty good which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a benefit right so</font>

1166
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,680
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm doing public private cloud stuff</font>

1167
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,089
and they're pretty simple and implement

1168
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,069
I don't need a lot of infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1169
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:03,109
need a few things and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get going</font>

1170
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty quickly you still need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

1171
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:06,980
about all that life cycle stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

1172
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,119
finding a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these upstart vendors</font>

1173
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,680
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of funding</font>

1174
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:11,359
they're missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into the</font>

1175
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,549
space without really understanding how

1176
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,700
you deal with life cycle events at scale

1177
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,790
and I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their technology and use</font>

1178
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,939
is good but the

1179
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,009
management of it is is is lacking right

1180
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,140
and and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times they don't have</font>

1181
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:28,910
the visibility into this so they're well

1182
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:33,990
intended but you have to fish that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1183
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:36,120
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into smart cards and certificates so</font>

1184
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,770
smart cards are pretty cool because it's

1185
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">public private key it does all the</font>

1186
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,790
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might want to do the</font>

1187
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:44,550
private key is always protected in the

1188
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,500
device your policy so only the person

1189
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:49,290
that's issued can operate that device it

1190
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,390
can do many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things and it's</font>

1191
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,850
incredibly secure when you implement it

1192
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,370
correctly the challenges you need a lot

1193
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of infrastructure you need a lot of key</font>

1194
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,420
management you need a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

1195
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,450
make this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly and of recent</font>

1196
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:06,030
times the challenge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only that is</font>

1197
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:08,100
complex and and resource intensive but

1198
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,740
it's terrible for mobile and cloud and

1199
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,690
most of my clients that did smart cards

1200
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,399
a while ago are killing off the smart

1201
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,350
card projects as the vendors haven't yet

1202
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,780
figured out how to really implement it

1203
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,430
well for mobile and cloud and that's

1204
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,350
where their executive said you know

1205
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,850
we're taking some applications there you

1206
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:28,140
know access to everybody all the time

1207
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,250
too bad right so this is starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1208
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed but it's going to be a little</font>

1209
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">while and one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like here</font>

1210
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:38,339
is you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> F so you two up is pretty cool</font>

1211
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,080
it's not the end all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you to F</font>

1212
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,420
is a specification it's not a standard

1213
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,610
and you through that feels kind of this

1214
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,390
thing we're smart cut you if you like

1215
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">asymmetric which I do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asymmetric key</font>

1216
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">public-private key the private key</font>

1217
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,120
stored in a secure element never leaves

1218
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,640
the device and smart cards were never

1219
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,490
really built to work with web interface

1220
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,980
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f was created by</font>

1221
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,120
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and you yuba code doing some</font>

1222
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,980
things and saying hey we should open

1223
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">this up where it integrates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1224
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,750
browser level without having to go ahead

1225
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and install any drivers or middleware</font>

1226
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:18,620
and it it addresses that web scenario in

1227
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:20,790
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple consumable way very nicely</font>

1228
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,319
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't do is it</font>

1229
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,370
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't do like a spine and it</font>

1230
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,860
won't do all these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they</font>

1231
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,210
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the smart card but to</font>

1232
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do is you can</font>

1233
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,230
virtualize you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> F is what's coming</font>

1234
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:33,689
next you can virtualize you to F and

1235
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,190
as an applet and shove it into a secure

1236
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,790
element where now you have the best of

1237
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,560
s/mime and you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> f without drivers and</font>

1238
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,480
in all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff the biggest thing</font>

1239
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,259
about you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> f that is really</font>

1240
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,510
groundbreaking is that the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works</font>

1241
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,510
is how you go you get issued a device

1242
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:54,869
from whoever and you go to a service

1243
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:56,790
let's say it's ABC and let's say it's

1244
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:58,260
amazon why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you go to</font>

1245
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazon now let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say they have a</font>

1246
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,030
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> f server and you to have service</font>

1247
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can go there and i plug it in and I</font>

1248
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,810
register it and what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

1249
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,420
issues a private key directly my secure

1250
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:11,549
element right it takes my device ID that

1251
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,930
has a public key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1252
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,430
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a private one that's only bound</font>

1253
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:16,470
for this service and then i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1254
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,720
another place it's totally disconnected

1255
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:21,209
from amazon or who issued it to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1256
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,910
repeat the process and so you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> f can</font>

1257
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:27,540
go ahead and support multiple different

1258
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:29,250
you to have services or relying parties

1259
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,230
without the relying party actually

1260
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,490
issuing the device so it solves that

1261
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,619
problem that we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about early on</font>

1262
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">which means you have a men's scale or if</font>

1263
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,640
i run a forum and i want strong

1264
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,340
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can just do a risk</font>

1265
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,560
score and say hey anybody wants to use

1266
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,900
you there you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> f device we have a you</font>

1267
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,180
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> f service it might just point it</font>

1268
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,220
somewhere else and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can use</font>

1269

our you to f device right<font color="#E5E5E5"> public private</font>

1272
00:47:54,570 --> 00:48:00,600
into QA there's some business stuff ah

1273
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:03,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to talk about for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a minute is so what do you do at the</font>

1275
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,740
organization level i like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you</font>

1276
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,149
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in there and say hey I want to</font>

1277
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix all your problems a technical</font>

1278
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:13,530
problem because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only so much</font>

1279
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,750
money to go around and the sea so is

1280
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,340
looking at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1281
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:20,130
important but it could be number 22 on

1282
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,690
my list after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk to me right so I</font>

1283
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:24,060
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay let's work backwards</font>

1284
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,710
from a threat model standpoint and say

1285
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,140
look what's what's most likely and

1286
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:30,270
highest impact and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of do this</font>

1287
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,359
for every organization uniquely because

1288
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:35,070
this is generic as an example and right

1289
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">here if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can find there's several</font>

1290
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:39,600
that are likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> in high-impact a CC is</font>

1291
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,759
going to start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know I can</font>

1292
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,618
kill three four birds with one step with

1293
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,220
one stone you know that might be

1294
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,480
worthwhile

1295
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,879
doing and you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a</font>

1296
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,440
technical case and then you need to

1297
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,240
build that that that business case

1298
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,349
because you're some<font color="#E5E5E5"> in elements where I</font>

1299
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,970
had a client where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisa was bonus on</font>

1300
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,930
trying to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and find additional</font>

1301
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,819
use cases for security and then the CIO

1302
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,290
this is a 10 billion dollar organization

1303
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:09,390
the CIO wanted to actually prove to the

1304
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:12,000
the CFO and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO that he could be a</font>

1305
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:15,060
business executive so he was trying to

1306
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to address problems that</font>

1307
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,720
would save<font color="#E5E5E5"> him money and then you know</font>

1308
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,940
so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up with the solution</font>

1309
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,430
would help them actually reduce a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1310
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,710
their office space by virtualizing

1311
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:28,290
things and using thin clients and unique

1312
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:31,050
identities and they lower their tax

1313
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,730
liability so CFO got on board the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO</font>

1314
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:35,190
got on board not for security and

1315
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,109
they're pushing through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 million</font>

1316
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollar project all because different</font>

1317
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:41,848
stakeholders is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

1318
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,740
stakeholder thing that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling to</font>

1319
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,119
you got to translate security at the

1320
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,709
value of security which we all live in

1321
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,720
that secure it's going to do it it's

1322
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:51,599
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it's going to reduce risk</font>

1323
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,368
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order for a CFO to fund it you</font>

1324
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,550
got to get them something and sometimes

1325
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:58,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's reducing areas even outside of</font>

1326
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:01,020
security right and I have models around

1327
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:03,270
this or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk but the my</font>

1328
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,440
parting words we have other slides but

1329
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,900
I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to them but my</font>

1330
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,890
parting words where would be when you go

1331
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,630
into this project yet to take a

1332
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,609
technical track and talk about the

1333
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,200
vulnerabilities and assets and controls

1334
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:15,119
and whether these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to do</font>

1335
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,500
what we're talking about but at another

1336
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,540
level you have to figure out who the

1337
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,950
stakeholders are and get their input

1338
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,240
because without finding out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the</font>

1339
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,710
stakeholders are you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

1340
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,200
what the capability of this thing needs

1341
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be what are the use cases for who</font>

1342
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,040
who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using it what are the</font>

1343
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:31,470
barriers for acceptance will be user

1344
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,290
mutiny<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you translate</font>

1345
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:36,209
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compatibility and technical don't</font>

1346
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:37,950
just take the technical track seek out

1347
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,050
the stakeholders and aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurities</font>

1348
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,180
get their feedback note this thing has

1349
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:45,240
to look like what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do what the</font>

1350
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,160
success criteria is you have all those

1351
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,689
elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build a tea co</font>

1352
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,740
roi model a technical model and then it

1353
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,300
can be interpreted by different

1354
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,310
stakeholders that to have those real

1355
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,480
discussions because without it you're

1356
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,779
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run into barriers where they</font>

1357
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,550
just

1358
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,230
tell you know somebody's telling you now

1359
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,940
is because somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else above said I</font>

1360
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time this isn't a priority</font>

1361
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,140
and you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get shut down not to get to</font>

1362
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom of it right so okay a lot of</font>

1363
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I'm going to take a couple</font>

1364
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions maybe raise your hand last</font>

1368
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:38,370
link i have is on the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide i</font>

1369
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:40,350
preciate it on this line so it ready

1370
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,400
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got that and I'll throw it to</font>

1371
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,069
the first slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute so you get</font>

1372
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,690
the link to the free zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep yeah you</font>

1373
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,910
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be researching other resources</font>

1374
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,160
it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there so well one of the</font>

1375
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,500
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do back in Noah Terry's I teach</font>

1376
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,830
the ESRI certified information security

1377
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:58,710
manager coughs and every time I have

1378
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:01,710
students doing that the first thing I do

1379
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,620
on day one of the course is to ask them

1380
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:06,330
to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the vision the goals and</font>

1381
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:08,970
the strategy of the company they're

1382
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:10,680
working for it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fun to</font>

1383
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:12,450
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people react to that because</font>

1384
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,609
while i'm working with security why I'm

1385
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:18,330
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about the vision and</font>

1386
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:21,870
goals and strategy of my employer and I

1387
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:26,750
teach them something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else ok questions</font>

1388
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:30,319
Oh Jeff somebody else I'll do this

1389
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,320
what's wrong with Jeff

1390
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:40,310
will cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friend awesome alright so</font>

1391
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:43,640
we've multi-factor we multiple factor

1392
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:46,460
for replacing password how do how do you

1393
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,339
deal with recovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc Corrales a you</font>

1394
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,200
use some new factor you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> f token you</font>

1395
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,570
are you lost you you to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tokens or</font>

1396
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,899
in Vegas yeah so how do you recover

1397
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,220
access so you to you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> F for me the way</font>

1398
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,500
I see is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1399
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,540
it's immature but if you go to something

1400
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,540
like let's take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart card for example</font>

1401
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so for like a 20 TP token you're</font>

1402
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,900
going to reissue a new one you're going

1403
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,359
to reissue a new seed and an either a

1404
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,580
new token or plug that's associate that

1405
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">C to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the virtual application that you</font>

1406
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:19,610
pushed out but a smart card is a good

1407
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:22,970
example because like you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> F it's based</font>

1408
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:25,700
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki model right because they're</font>

1409
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,290
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 and in them and and the reason</font>

1410
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,379
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use smart card is because it is</font>

1411
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:32,600
amateur model maybe not as scalable as

1412
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:35,030
we want for new uses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good</font>

1413
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,610
model that I would that's where it gets

1414
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:39,860
back to key management so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would the</font>

1415
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:42,650
first thing I would do is I'm going to

1416
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a transport key with the</font>

1417
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:47,180
manufacturer the the cards and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

1418
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,460
i receive the cards i'm going to do a

1419
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,470
key ceremony to create my own master key

1420
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">set so nobody else knows them even after</font>

1421
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:57,140
transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i manage all my own</font>

1422
00:53:54,050 --> 00:54:00,200
keys my my certificates are in my own CA

1423
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,580
or third-party CA whatever it is and so

1424
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,950
what I would typically do in that

1425
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario is i would go ahead and issue</font>

1426
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:10,310
you new authentication and signing

1427
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,620
certificates but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do escrow of</font>

1428
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:17,570
your authentication certificates and

1429
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:22,370
upon issuing your new smart card insert

1430
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:24,980
i would go ahead and issue you either i

1431
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:28,130
would issue basically key history so

1432
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you previously encrypted you</font>

1433
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,960
can decrypt in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

1434
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,670
where pki and and key management gets

1435
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,180
very difficult because you know you're

1436
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:39,560
getting into key management escrow and

1437
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,299
recovery and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1438
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,460
key history out to somebody that's

1439
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,380
across the content

1440
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,450
you can do this in some of these modes

1441
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,550
through clients and you know in

1442
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,710
automation but it's it's got to be rock

1443
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,180
solid you know if you have 10,000 users

1444
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,740
and they go through a process it doesn't

1445
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,640
work out the time or they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1446
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:58,959
what's happening well nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is showing</font>

1447
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,210
but it's really going to be around

1448
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,060
escrow and key history is the way I see

1449
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:06,730
it in a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure and scalable model</font>

1450
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:09,160
and then some technologies aren't

1451
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:13,109
capable of that we have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here</font>

1452
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,109
thank you again already thank you
