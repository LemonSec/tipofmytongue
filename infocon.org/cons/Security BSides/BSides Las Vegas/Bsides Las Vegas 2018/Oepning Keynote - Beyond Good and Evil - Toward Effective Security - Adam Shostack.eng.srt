I realized how much that that the

enthusiasm we bring to what we do

53
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:39,470
contrasts contrasts with the way in

your weekend on hold well there's an

emergency it's the ongoing issues and

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,400
and these issues lead to problem

79
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,719
statements like this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Rogers</font>

who have been hacked and those who

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:17,640
hacked but don't know it yet closely

have been hacked and those that don't

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,930
know they've been hacked and the reason

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,610
I bring in this second variant is

92
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:42,960
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's absolutely right</font>

93
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:46,740
when she says we like to say this we

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,280
giggle and you laugh when we say there's

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,200
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two types of companies and I think</font>

96
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I think about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,990
of burn ouch because if we can't prevent

98
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,820
our companies from getting hacked and if

99
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,770
we're lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that they've been</font>

100
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:08,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacked well that seems to me to relate</font>

101
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:15,750
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> low levels of efficacy and it relates</font>

102
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:17,609
closely to burn ouch and so it's hard to

103
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,950
defend our systems we accept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

104
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,900
hard to defend our systems you probably

105
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,640
experienced management looking at you

106
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,460
when you come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

107
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,590
deploy this or deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look at you</font>

108
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,700
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're asking for it to pour money</font>

109

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,669
deployed these things they still won't

114

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been hacked</font>

115
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,090
they stoop

116
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,610
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present a model of the</font>

117
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">world and this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a model as I say</font>

118
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,690
in the threat modeling book all<font color="#E5E5E5"> models</font>

119
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:11,380
are wrong and some models are useful I

120
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,980
hope that this is a useful kind of model

121
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">really as a as a way to think about the</font>

122
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,370
state of the world and the state of the

123
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:24,099
world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that companies invest to</font>

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,340
prevent attacks they invest to detect

125
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,420
attacks and they invest to respond and

126
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">then there's training that goes on and</font>

127
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,420
then attacks happen and we may or may

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,640
not notice them so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

129
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:43,330
little bit about how we invest in these

130
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:48,070
controls the first way we invest in

131
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:53,080
controls is oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god apt and we say</font>

132
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:57,610
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going we're going</font>

133
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,609
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this because someone told us it</font>

134
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,530
will work we also invest in controls

135
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of standards and compliance</font>

136
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,119
somebody says you have to do this

137
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether that's PCI whether that's</font>

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,060
FedRAMP whatever the standard is

139
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,210
oftentimes the standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and compliance</font>

140
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,600
with those standards end up absorbing

141
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:21,400
our entire budgets it absorbs everything

142
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,410
that management is willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,679
because by the time you're done hitting

144
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that bar it's no longer a min bar it's</font>

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,350
where you must be we also invest because

146
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,450
someone tells us that this or that is a

147
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:40,210
best practice um and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

148
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,270
running without my involvement or

149
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:49,120
touching things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is super exciting</font>

150
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:55,000
ah so whoever's taken control of the RF

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:08:01,600
device could you please stop well maybe

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,680
it has maybe it hasn't so otay

153
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,449
compliance best practices and we plug

154
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,879
these things into frame

155
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,080
work such as prevent and detect and

156
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:17,620
respond or people process and technology

157
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,878
and without meaning any disrespect if I

158
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:24,009
were at say our essay or sands or some

159
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,589
other conference I could probably

160
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">present this with a straight face and no</font>

161
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:34,719
one would object may be without the oh

162
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,789
my god a pto day but maybe with but I

163
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are things missing and I</font>

164
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,159
think there are important things missing

165
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:45,220
and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's missing is</font>

166
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,610
lessons learned of some form the idea

167
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,279
that after a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens we go back</font>

168
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we try to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something from that</font>

169
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,089
problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

170
00:08:53,199 --> 00:09:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't happen again more broadly we're</font>

171
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:03,790
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback loops we're missing any</font>

172
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,729
ability to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge that we learn</font>

173
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,260
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one incident and plug it into</font>

174
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:15,430
anything and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all we're missing</font>

175
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,699
science and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the ability to test</font>

176
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,130
our hypotheses to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make statements that</font>

177
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,729
we believe are reasonable because we've

178
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:27,339
subjected them to aggressive testing is

179
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,610
just not here in our profession and this

180
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,269
ties to the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were burnt ouch</font>

181
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:39,399
and that brings me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question of</font>

182
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:42,519
why are they missing brings me to the

183
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,279
question of why are they missing on and

184
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,730
a big part of the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

185
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:52,540
missing is because we don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

186
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's gone wrong we like to see</font>

187
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,610
no evil we like to hear no evil well

188
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,829
that's not true we love to hear evil and

189
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,680
giggle and point fingers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

190
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,839
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best way to respond but</font>

191
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,510
unfortunately it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot of</font>

192
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,440
the way that we respond but most

193
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:14,860
importantly we like to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> no evil we</font>

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,800
like to never<font color="#E5E5E5"> own up to a problem which</font>

195
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,360
has occurred because those problem well

196
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

197
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,170
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

198
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,790
a little bit later but we don't like to

199
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:31,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">sit to say I experienced this issue and</font>

200
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,990
here's what happened and here's what we

201
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:39,010
did about it we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hate doing</font>

202
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:41,440
that and we do a little bit of

203
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,080
information sharing information sharing

204
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,350
has been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzword at the policymaker</font>

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,030
level for 20-plus years and it's working

206
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">so well that it continues to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

207
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:55,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzzword at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policymaker level on or</font>

208
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,810
maybe it's not working quite so well and

209
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,320
I like to contrast sharing with the idea

210
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of publication and this is a little bit</font>

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,540
like the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between open source</font>

212
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,550
and closed source if you have an open

213
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,040
source product you can dig into it you

214
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,569
can understand how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

215
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,060
a close source product you have a

216
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">different business model I'm not going</font>

217
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,650
to say one is better than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other but</font>

218
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,130
i will say that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it to</font>

219
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">illuminate our thinking about what we</font>

220
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,300
might do when we think about sharing

221
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,160
information versus publishing

222
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,579
information that's happened during

223
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,640
incidents and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

224
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,640
about these ideas a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times they</font>

225
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">will tell me publication is impossible</font>

226
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,900
no one will ever stand for it on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

227
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,960
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening but the truth</font>

228
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,380
is publication actually happens today we

229
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:57,370
publish information about our security

230
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:00,760
incidents arm there's data breach

231
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:07,810
notification laws which require and at

232
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:09,430
times um there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> FISMA the the federal</font>

233
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,930
Information Security Management Act

234
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:16,089
which requires reporting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> on us search</font>

235
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,040
and then they take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and</font>

236
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,020
they publish it once a year making it

237
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,640
available to anyone who<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to see it</font>

238
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:27,040
on Florida this this hasn't gotten a lot

239
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> press i'm not sure why but florida</font>

240
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,530
just enacted a new breach law and under

241
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,810
the new Florida day to protect data

242
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,930
breach law

243
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,520
the Attorney General after an incident

244
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:48,370
the Attorney General of the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

245
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:52,210
Florida can ask you for a copy on can

246
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,120
ask you for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy of the forensic</font>

247
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:59,290
report and your data security policies

248
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,230
and if you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about where</font>

249
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that not to go I might suggest</font>

250
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,700
that an attorney<font color="#CCCCCC"> general might be high</font>

251
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:13,210
on your list and without commenting on

252
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:16,030
the wisdom of this law in any way I will

253
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,100
note that all of the lobbying which

254
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,089
organizations might have attempted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

255
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,390
prevent this law from coming into effect

256
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:29,920
didn't work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the law came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into effect</font>

257
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:31,449
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy makers don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

258
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,250
fact that there are two types of

259
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies those that know they've been</font>

260
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,480
hacked and those that haven't figured it

261
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,689
out they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a bad situation</font>

262
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,180
for society and they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

263
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,460
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it whether they're doing</font>

264
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,880
something successfully that's a question

265
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:52,600
we we can debate ideally with with adult

266
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:56,140
beverages handy um there's the verizon

267
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,770
debe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir which which people often bring</font>

268
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,770
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a fan of the debe ir and they</font>

269
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,660
do their darndest to explain what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

270
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,340
they're seeing and how they're doing

271
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,520
their analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have tremendous</font>

272
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,040
respect for them but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth is no one</font>

273
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,740
else can replicate the work that they're

274
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,130
doing no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has access to the data</font>

275
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,590
set to dig in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say if I do this</font>

276
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,990
analysis do I get to the same answers

277
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,870
that they do and the ability to

278
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,030
replicate work is a tremendously

279
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,880
important element<font color="#E5E5E5"> of science and it's an</font>

280
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:33,670
important element<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why we need to move</font>

281
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,780
towards a publication model for

282
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:40,829
incidents um most of the publication

283
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:43,600
which happens today the details don't

284
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually enable anyone to see what</font>

285
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,069
happened for example arm

286
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,279
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> too oh I don't know the</font>

287
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:54,719
target breach um we learned that

288
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,170

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and out from this GAO report</font>

321
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,990
deploy certain security controls the

322
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,930
number of agencies which are ninety to a

323
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,589
hundred percent effective at

324
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,609
configuration management and

325
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:58,679
vulnerability management is the far left

326
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,120
it's two organizations are doing config

327
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,400
management over ninety to a hundred

328
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,210
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their ass</font>

329
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,720
and for our doing volunteering over

330
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,000
ninety to a hundred percent most are at

331
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,450
less than sixty percent of their systems

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,260
and this is the case where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

333
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,660
laws in place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring this up i</font>

334
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:23,000
bring this up not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

335
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a problem but because i think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">an opportunity and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to talk</font>

337
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:33,139
about an engineering approach that takes

338
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:38,659
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this if we believe that</font>

339
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:41,180
controls vary across organizations that

340
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,760
compliance is a goal not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

341
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that few organizations are a hundred</font>

342
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,620
percent compliant then we can actually

343
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:54,080
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this as a basis for science</font>

344
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,510
so for example if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have eight</font>

345
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,540
organizations cleverly labeled

346
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,730
organizations one through eight and we

347
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,909
have eight controls which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked out</font>

348
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:08,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a hat ranging from user education to</font>

349
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:11,390
password policy or patch management and

350
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:15,590
we conveniently deploy them in different

351
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,930
ways then we can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we</font>

352
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:24,320
might learn from these different

353
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:27,440
deployments so we can believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope we</font>

354
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,679
can agree in fact that controls should

355
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,630
prevent incidents or that control should

356
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,680
help us detect incidents because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

357
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:38,690
don't why are we deploying them and so I

358
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,050
also believe that we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

359
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,970
agree the different types of controls

360
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:47,480
should prevent different types of

361
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,720
incidents so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might say</font>

362
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,900
that user education is unlikely to have

363
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,450
any impact on zero-day vulnerabilities

364
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,780
it might change the rate at which people

365
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,730
put USB sticks in their computers and

366
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,170
are attacked by otto rahn or office

367
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:08,510
macros but compared to patch management

368
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,090
where we know that we can deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a patch</font>

369
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,770
and deal with autorun worms we can

370
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,580
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> patches and deal with office</font>

371
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">mappers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

372
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,710
deploy patches and deal with issues that

373
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have patches available for them those</font>

374
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,480
are places where we believe strongly

375
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:26,210
that these controls should have a

376
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:32,060
measurable impact on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> incidents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

377
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:36,290
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and then pay attention</font>

378
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:41,870
to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens and these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

379
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:43,909
hypothetical incidents we we might be

380
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do science so here we are seeing</font>

381
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:49,910
organization one has had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day</font>

382
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,790
issues no autorun no office macros

383
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,410
people install software people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

384
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,480
tricked into doing things and they have

385
00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:03,020
configuration issues similarly or<font color="#CCCCCC"> coops</font>

386
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,740
similarly organization to has some zero

387
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,139
day and some users getting tricked and

388
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,300
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously a constructed</font>

389
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,200
example but the constructed example

390
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:18,020
allows us to compare what controls are

391
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
in place of an organization versus what

392
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:24,700
sort of incidents are happening and if

393
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do this then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we might learn is</font>

394
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,260
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example every organization that</font>

hasn't deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emmett Microsoft's</font>

396
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:38,060

toolkit thank you arm every organization

398
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,710
that hasn't deployed it is hit by OJ see

399
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:47,690
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's the I'm at column so not</font>

400
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,670
deploying it you got hit deploying it

401
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:52,760
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people still get hit we do see</font>

402
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,350
bypasses for that technology we could

403
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,530
see that every organization without

404
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:00,560
patch management this bottom half<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

405
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to seven is hit by autorun worms none of</font>

406
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones with the with patch management</font>

407
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,530
are impacted and so we can say that

408
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,540
appears to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effective control we</font>

409
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">can test the hypothesis which we</font>

410
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,050
formulated by looking at the incidents

411
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:21,020
which occur and we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

412
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,730
develop a new model of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,000
modified model

getting recorded to<font color="#CCCCCC"> someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

416
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,410
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do analysis that can look at</font>

what's happening and say here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

can learn from what actually occurred in

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:48,020
the world and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do that analysis</font>

420
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:50,929
based on reports from organizations with

421
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,750
different controls we can start to

422
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,690
assess which controls really work and

423
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,820
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change the advice that we</font>

424
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,410
give and whether that advice comes in

425
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:09,350
the form of pci or federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iso</font>

426
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:13,549
27001 or industry best practice which no

427
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:16,809
cio would possibly violate<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font>

428
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:19,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to someone earlier who mentioned that</font>

429
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,370
their customers would love to replace

<font color="#CCCCCC">their antivirus and just stop using it</font>

431
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,770
but that's such a politically charged

432
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:32,929
thing that you couldn't possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so</font>

433
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:35,059
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could provide evidence that</font>

00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,970
taking out the AV didn't make a

435
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,830
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of the number of</font>

436
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromises then those people could</font>

437
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,360
deploy their budgets more effectively

438
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,030
and in deploying their budgets more

439
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:50,629
effectively they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a greater</font>

440
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,190
impact on what's happening and if they

441
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,980
have a greater impact on what's

442
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,160
happening maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just maybe we'll have a</font>

443
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,160
little bit less burnout now one thing

444
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people often bring up when I when I</font>

445
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,429
show this model is that attacks aren't

446
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,140
unevenly distributed or that they

447
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:13,070
believe attacks are unevenly distributed

448
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,590
I personally don't believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

449
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,629
it's a testable hypothesis but it's

450
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,580
worth dealing with and I think the way

451
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,070
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it in the short term</font>

452
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:28,129
is to simulate attacks to deploy our

453
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,559
penetration testers in ways that are

454
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,320
designed to actually help us answer the

455
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,178
questions about is this control

456
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,649
effective if I know I have four

457
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:39,530
organizations and two

458
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,190
of them have AV and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to don't do the pen</font>

459
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,920
testers have differential success in

460
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,810
breaking into them and if they don't

461
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,990
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tappers like those pen testers</font>

462
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:53,240
are not impacted and so we can use

463
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,430
simulated attacks to deal with the

464
00:23:53,240 --> 00:24:02,330
different distributions of attacks which

465
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:08,360
may exist in the real world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

466
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:11,840
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a worthwhile thing so we're</font>

here we're not there how do we get there

468
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:23,120
on and more importantly why don't we

469
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about what's happened to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us I said</font>

471

Darth Vader looming over us and Darth

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many reasons that</font>

478

organizations don't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

reasons are really well understood we've

we've been beating a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a</font>

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,180
your stock price will collapse or your

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,880
customers will flee are well known we

price what has been studied first the

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:25,429
impact of a breach disclosure on stock

490
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,270
price was first studied by aqua ZD and

491
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:33,320
to Lang in 2006 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found is</font>

492
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:35,420
that most organizations see a two to

493
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,389
three percent hit in their stock price

494
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,270
which statistically disappears in two to

495
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,590
three days now I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying that a two</font>

to three percent hitting your stock

497

price<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a desirable</font>

498
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,040
thing but I am saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does not</font>

499
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">line up with the fear that prevents us</font>

500
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,060
from talking about

501
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,890
things on one thing that people

502
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,879
sometimes bring up when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

stock price is but choice point or but

504
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,360
some other outlier which is a

505
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:08,790
statistical abnormality if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

506
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,209
see what happens to a company like TJX

507
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:19,129
on Gunnar Peterson has been blogging

508
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:23,280
about this on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 raindrop log and</font>

509
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:25,640
the answer is TJX after the biggest at

510
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,780
the time biggest breach in history a

511

long um but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the biggest</font>

00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach in history and it turns out that</font>

514
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,000
in the several<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarters after the</font>

516

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers probably aren't</font>

really fleeing there's a there's a

519
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,920
belief and if you call cut if you call

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them what</font>

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,340
would you do with an organization you

will say in survey after survey they

528
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,699
will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they will stop doing</font>

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,130
turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a little difficult to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting easier on but it also turns out</font>

538
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,720
that moving accounts around is

539
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:50,850
challenging that TJ TJ<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxx has a value</font>

proposition that people find attractive

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:57,750
and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going there and when</font>

542
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,910
you ask not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumers or the</font>

543
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,040
citizens but you ask the people who work

544
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,559
at these organizations what happened

545
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,769
after you<font color="#E5E5E5"> told people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about this abnormal customer churn is</font>

547
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:13,830
generally on the order of three to five

548
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:16,860
percent which again<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

would embrace or look forward to but it

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,479
is definitely not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eighty to ninety</font>

551
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:23,669
percent which you will hear people using

in their marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> literature because</font>

00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:29,220
that's what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell them that they</font>

554
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:33,179
will do there's also the question of

555
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:36,149
will I get sued and the answer according

556
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,850
to Sasha romanovsky is that about one in

557
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:42,600
seven breaches leads to a federal

558
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,418
lawsuit most of those are dismissed

559
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,350
before the discovery phase because of

560
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:51,029
the difficulty in articulating harm and

561
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,029
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you can do like</font>

562
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,659
providing credit monitoring which have a

00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:59,429
statistically significant substantially

564
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:02,009
significant impact on the likelihood

565
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:05,249
that you'll be sued<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so these things</font>

566
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:07,799
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we believe will happen as it turns</font>

567
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:09,899
out when we study them when we have a

to study what happened and it turns out

this statistical analysis and it is a

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">i believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that each of these issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

582
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,149
be overcome but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's another</font>

583
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:56,610
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't like to talk about</font>

584
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:58,768
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's another</font>

585
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,539
reason and this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comfortable</font>

586
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,850
reason but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be</font>

587
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:07,559
brought up and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and that is</font>

588
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:09,990
you that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think many of the</font>

589
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:13,889
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this room with all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our due</font>

590
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,200
respect are part of the problem that

591
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:17,740
you're part of the problem because you

592
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,920
don't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's</font>

593
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:25,750
bent you take these issues and you sweep

594
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:28,690
them under the rug and when I wrote this

595
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,570
slide I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we because I've</font>

596
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,020
been party to this myself on occasion

597
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:37,090
but a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago a few years ago I</font>

598
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,860
started publishing the things that I was

599
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:42,309
involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had the ability to</font>

600
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,350
publish and I'll tell you honestly every

601
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:46,389
time I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit publish on one of</font>

602
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,428
those blog posts I had butterflies in my

603
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,500
stomach and I had fear and I didn't

604
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:56,490
sleep well the night before I published

605
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:59,410
it it's scary I I feel that fear I

606
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:02,470
understand and I sympathize but what I

607
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,440
have discovered in doing this in talking

608
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:08,710
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's gone wrong why it's gone</font>

609
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:13,929
wrong is that the things I expected to

610
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:16,300
happen didn't happen I'm admitting to

611
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:19,030
multiple security issues with sites that

612
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,620
i am personally responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

613
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,520
still here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front of the room had</font>

614
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,469
besides it has not hurt my career should

615
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,750
be able to talk to be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

616
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:34,630
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things it it's scary it gets</font>

617
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,940
a little less scary over time and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

618
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:43,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that you are probably</font>

619
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:46,150
afraid and that you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and</font>

620
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,740
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another variant of that which is</font>

621
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe you're not afraid maybe you</font>

622
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,150
believe this maybe you think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

623
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:56,260
right thing to do but you let people who

624
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:57,880
are afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> when someone else says gosh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

625
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to talk about that and</font>

626
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:04,240
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of saying no we should really</font>

627
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:06,250
talk about that you say well ok we'll

628
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,260
we'll just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the minimum will do what's</font>

629
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:13,809
required by law and if it's not required

630
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:16,330
by law<font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't say anything so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

631
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:19,270
about the question in terms of who

632
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,428
should be afraid and when I think if you

633
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,220
should be afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> who should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be afraid</font>

634
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:27,990
excuse me I think there are

635
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:30,280
characteristics that make it more

636
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,620
reasonable that you should be frightened

637
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,260
of what's going to happen

638
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,659
after you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just closed a breach I think</font>

639
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">about small companies whose products may</font>

640
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:43,080
not be well integrated into operations

641
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:46,290
just yet I think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> young companies</font>

642
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,470
companies that haven't had time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

643
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:52,559
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the depth of relationship that larger</font>

644
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:55,740
organization should have and I think

645
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,899
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> armed security companies companies</font>

646
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,930
whose products are supposed to prevent a

647
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:03,360
problem which don't prevent a problem

648
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:06,540
and so when I think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

649
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:12,830
things I also think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company</font>

650
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:15,270
called bit9 and in February of 2013 bit9

651
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,820
came out and talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident</font>

652
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:21,030
that as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I'm aware no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

653
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,370
forced them to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

654
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:26,370
and said and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come over here</font>

655
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and greed what they said we want to be</font>

656
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,739
as we continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as open as possible</font>

657
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:34,919
and share details with the security

658
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,800
community at large in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopes that</font>

659
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,580
this information will help others and

660
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,149
they chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this and they chose to</font>

661
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">do this even though it was scary and the</font>

662
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">person who chose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this is a fellow</font>

663
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,820
named Harris<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferd love and when I asked</font>

664
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,800
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this Harry said I spent as</font>

665
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,260
much time with the lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the PR</font>

666
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,950
firm as I get in the war room because

667
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:05,820
their natural reaction is to say as

668
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:09,840
little as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end we didn't</font>

669
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:12,540
lose any customers or prospects I'm

670
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat that in the end we</font>

671
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:20,009
didn't lose any customers or prospects

672
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,529
in fact it actually increased the

673
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,820
respect for many of our customers

674
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,639
because they prefer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with vendors</font>

675
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,110
that show transparency and Harry is

676
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,649
actually here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room Harry would</font>

677
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,649
you stand up

678
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:45,010
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very um what what you did</font>

679
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:47,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inspiration to me the fact</font>

680
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:49,779
that you went and you fought for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

681
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,159
when your organization didn't have to

682
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:55,809
say anything is great so thank you I

683
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:59,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about another organization</font>

684
00:34:55,809 --> 00:35:01,720
that got hacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I want to talk about</font>

685
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:07,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">another organization that got hacked and</font>

686
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:11,200
that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> onion yes America's finest</font>

687
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:15,549
news source came under attack from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

688
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,980
Syrian electronic army and after they

689
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:19,839
did they had a little fun with the

690
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,940
Syrian electronic army with headlines

691
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,549
such as the Syrian electronic army has a

692
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:30,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">little fun before inevitable upcoming</font>

693
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">deaths at the hands of rebels they had</font>

694
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:37,150
more fun um claiming that this was an

695
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:42,819
article<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Syrian electronic army</font>

696
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:45,009
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we regretted our actions as soon</font>

697
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:47,170
as we hacked into the onion site and saw

698
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:51,880
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a goddamn mess it is with all those</font>

699
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:55,660
ads seriously that site is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete</font>

700
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,849
disaster so they had their fun which is

701
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">great which is what you would expect the</font>

702
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:05,890
onion to do but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might not</font>

703
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:09,369
expect the onion to do is to publish a

704
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:11,940
blog post entitled how the Syrian

705
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:15,039
electronic army hacked the onion and

706
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,400
they published this on their github blog

707
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:21,220
and they talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they showed</font>

708
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,950
examples of exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the phishing</font>

709
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,899
messages looked like they showed

710
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:31,990
examples of what the URLs looked like

711
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:36,539
they took the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

712
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:39,910
available to them and like 'but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine</font>

713
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:44,430
they shared it with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community in the</font>

714
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,430
hopes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of helping people do better</font>

715
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:56,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">The Onion disclosure of incidents is</font>

716
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:01,670
sometimes a duty in it's sometimes a

717
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:04,010
choice sometimes for consumer protection

718
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:08,960
reasons the government mandates that we

719
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:11,000
talk about these incidents sometimes the

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:22,730
that you choose to do what you just

724
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">closed is also a matter of duties and</font>

725
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:37,280
choices it's sorry um sometimes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

726
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:40,069
oh excuse me the law imposes a floor on

727
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,910
what it is you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it does</font>

728
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:46,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">not impose a ceiling you you have a</font>

729
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,839
choice about how much you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

730
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,730
say you have the choice that Harry made

731
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,340
you have the choice that the onion made

732
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:55,130
you have the choices that you or<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

733
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:59,960
organization are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make in the</font>

734
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:06,620
future talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these incidents in</font>

735
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:08,180
detail is scary it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to do</font>

736
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:13,910
it's hard to convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that it's</font>

737
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:16,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing um but talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

738
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things early can help you close</font>

739
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,220
the books on what's happened saying

740
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,280
here's what we know we'll come back and

741
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,660
tell you more in a little bit and

742
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,390
providing the details that help<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

743
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:33,230
understand the truth can be a powerful

744
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:42,740
thing versus being a press target for a

745
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:46,570
very long time so brings me to a

746
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:50,270
question of what you're going to do next

747
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,730
right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all to stop and</font>

748
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:55,520
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the burnout that you've</font>

749
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,470
experienced the burnout that you felt

750
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,819
the burn out that you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

751
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,058
call

752
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:03,670
I want you to think about what that's

753
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:06,789
like because I want you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

754
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:09,039
those feelings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason that I</font>

755
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:12,420
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember those feelings is</font>

756
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:15,699
because one day you may have a choice

757
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,660
you might be in the midst of a breach

758
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:23,529
response you might be in a position to

759
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:27,308
influence what happens you might be in a

760
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:31,989
position when the CEO or the CIO looks

761
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:36,279
over at you and says can we talk about

762
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:38,680
this you're a media response whether

763
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:42,009
it's an odd or whether it's a shake of

764
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,319
the head settles the issue if you say

765
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:47,769
yes then you can have those

766
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:51,099
conversations if you show fear the

767
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:53,618
question is almost inevitably closed and

768
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:55,809
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to think about the</font>

769
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,420
sensation of burnout I want you to think

770
00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:01,479
about the lack of efficacy which you

771
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,549
feel in your job would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear your</font>

772
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:06,549
colleagues talking about what you see

773
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:09,880
Jack Daniel and others doing surveys

774
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:13,239
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is so prevalent and</font>

775
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,359
I want you to remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling so</font>

776
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:18,400
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens to you when it</font>

777
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:21,308
happens to your colleagues when you're

778
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,140
hearing about this over a beer I would

779
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you to make a commitment right now</font>

780
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,170
I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to commit to push to</font>

781
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:32,169
get this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to talk about</font>

782
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,199
the details I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to decide</font>

783
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:37,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you will make that push I'm not</font>

784
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,569
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you because it may not be your</font>

785
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,809
decision to definitely do all I'm asking

786
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:46,420
is that you will push you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask your</font>

787
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:48,479
management to do the right thing you

788
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,219
will tell them why it's the right thing

789
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:57,759
you will argue to the best of your

790
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:59,529
ability to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen so I'm going</font>

791
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:02,859
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask those of you who are willing to</font>

792
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:04,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">make such a commitment to stand up like</font>

793
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:08,170
you to make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment in public to</font>

794
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:11,920
say yes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

795
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">time the next time this happens to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

796
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:30,430
the next time I see this I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

797
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">push I'm going to push our thank you</font>

798
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,350
before you sit down I'd like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn</font>

799
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to one side shake hands with the person</font>

800
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:41,620
next to you like you to turn to the

801
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">other side and shake hands and you're</font>

802
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,130
laughing the reason i am asking you to

803
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:50,020
do this is because i want this moment to

804
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,570
be fixed in your minds and you can have

805
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,280
a seat thank you I want this moment to

806
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,110
be fixed in your mind's I want you to

807
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember this I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font>

808
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you made a decision about what to</font>

809
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:08,080
do when this happens because it is in

810
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,410
each of our hands to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

811
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:17,080
better it is within our power to make

812
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:19,420
change and what happened here what will

813
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,850
happen next is a first step in that

814
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:25,990
change and I think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

815
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:28,240
change and a worthwhile one because to

816
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:31,750
the extent that there are two types of

817
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,669
companies I think there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be two</font>

818
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,500
different types of companies there will

819
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,630
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who talk about the details of</font>

820
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">their incidents there will be those who</font>

821
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:42,970
talk about the root causes and those who

822
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,720
don't I think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an important</font>

823
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:49,480
problem and i'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am hardened to</font>

824
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,120
say that with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> commitment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font>

825
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we will do better thank you very</font>

826
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,190
much and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am happy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

827
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:04,780
questions

828
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:04,780
[Applause]

829
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:18,330
yes um do we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro nur or should</font>

830
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:54,870
I'll just repeat the question for the

831
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:56,490
video so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how can we</font>

832
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:00,270
develop a better learning environment

833
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:04,740
amongst ourselves and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

834
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:07,590
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my answer is being aware being</font>

835
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,740
aware that our initial response choose

836
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,630
someone telling us about a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

837
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">very telling it's very meaningful it's</font>

838
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:20,310
very impactful and the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is a</font>

839
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,340
very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> question which is how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can I</font>

840
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:25,950
help when when someone tells you about a

841
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,350
problem instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font>

842
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:38,149
let those people get away<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that ask</font>

843
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:38,150
the question how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I help yes</font>

844
00:44:46,740 --> 00:45:00,959
yep so so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is will the</font>

845
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:03,750
hackers up their game and I believe that

846
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes and i believe it is</font>

847
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,280
really easy to believe that when you

848
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,200
just closed there was a causal chain

849
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,290
between your disclosure and the hackers

850
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,210
upping their game<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would challenge you</font>

851
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,490
to say how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that those</font>

852
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:21,300
hackers change their behavior because of

853
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:24,209
what you did versus they learned a new

854
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,100
technique they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out through some</font>

855
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,450
other channel that didn't involve you

856
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,210
that they were being<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitored because</font>

857
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:33,830
of this or that right how do you know

858
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,830
that what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is the issue oh</font>

859
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

860
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,750
so so that's what that is a great point

861
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,150
which is that if you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

862
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:13,640
company that has a train wreck of a

863
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:17,030
response which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe is an</font>

864
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:20,180
incredibly common problem disclosing

865
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,980
that is even harder um if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

866
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:26,299
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about bait for a lawsuit that's</font>

867
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably bait for a lawsuit I would flip</font>

868
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,579
that around a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit and say how do</font>

869
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:35,049
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that companies</font>

870
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:35,050
don't know how to respond

871
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:51,240
so so so small groups can absolutely

872
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,250
help in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that situation I wonder about</font>

873
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,410
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly that scales and how quickly</font>

874
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lessons get out because it seems to</font>

875
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,120
me that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been watching train wreck a</font>

876
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,180
forensic responses for a good 25 years

877
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and we're not talking about the</font>

878
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,520
problem in enough detail with enough

879
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,850
honesty that I can sit in an audience

880
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,980
here talk and say wow my disaster

881
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,779
response plan looked a lot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

882
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,020
and boy was it painful when they

883
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,810
executed it I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go change mine</font>

884
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:23,759
so yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a painful thing</font>

885
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:27,500
when you have a train wreck of a

886
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,930
forensic spit or the logs are gone or

887
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:34,380
someone deleted the logs reimaging the

888
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,259
system before forensics showed up or you

889
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,490
weren't logging the right things but

890
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,850
until we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about those things</font>

891
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us our ability to learn and</font>

892
00:47:41,850 --> 00:48:15,360
get better is very narrowly defined is

893
00:47:45,810 --> 00:48:20,750
very narrowly scoped um so what

894
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:24,030
strategies for dealing with politics um

895
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,910
the first strategy is to find a mentor

896
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:29,670
out in your organization who understands

897
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works who's not in security who</font>

898
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:35,430
can give you feedback about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

899
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:37,200
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on good communication skills are</font>

900
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,319
dependent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

901
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,549
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

902
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,200
working at startups and working at

903
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,840
Microsoft is the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you</font>

904
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,290
communicate the cadence of communication

905
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,030
makes a big difference everywhere being

906
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,410
there before there's a problem makes a

907
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:55,870
difference and lastly a

908
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:58,060
mine recommended a book recently called

909
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:00,910
what got you here won't get you there

910
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,020
and you think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you</font>

911
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know about the book from the</font>

912
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,230
title<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it actually focuses on 20</font>

913
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:12,520
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this management coach</font>

914
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:14,140
regularly sees and what I don't want to

915
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,190
point fingers but I see a lot of these

916
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:21,430
in infosec always say<font color="#CCCCCC"> em no adding too</font>

917
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,440
much value and politics are a fact of

918
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,180
organizations you have to learn to deal

919
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them to be effective at some level</font>

920
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,290
or you have to say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

921
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologist and I'm going to work for a</font>

922
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:35,890
manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> who can deal with that for me so</font>

923
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:41,560
it's it's not the stuff we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

924
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:50,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's the stuff we have to do yes the</font>

925
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:50,759
dreaded soft skills um yes

926
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:24,180
yep so it's so the question is this is a

927
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:27,090
talk and at the grassroots not the sea

928
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">level and I have had this conversation</font>

929
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">with with the sea level and their</font>

930
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:39,060
responses are actually no different than

931
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,649
ours they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid they are worried</font>

932
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,560
about stock price they're worried about

933
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:46,020
customers fleeing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about these</font>

934
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways and the advice</font>

935
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:51,540
that comes to them tends to be don't do

936
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:55,710
this when you walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through these things</font>

937
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,600
with them some sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say oh</font>

938
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,670
hey I understand what you're saying

939
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,750
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good examples we're</font>

940
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:06,390
gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this others say no I just don't</font>

941
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,520
see the upside in it for me but I

942
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,870
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> fundamentally what I've seen is</font>

943
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,980
the responses are the same and I'm

944
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting some nods from some other</font>

945
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:26,640
c-level people in the the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

946
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,110
that causes them to respond in a

947
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:33,210
negative way is this doesn't improve

948
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:35,220
their products it doesn't grow their

949
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:36,990
market and it doesn't cut their costs

950
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,640
and if you're an executive at a big

951
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:41,040
company fundamentally those are the

952
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,480
three things you care about and this

953
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,790
doesn't line up with those and so the

954
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,400
question is why do it part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

955
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is now laws and part of the answer</font>

956
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,190
frankly over the next few years is more

957
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,980
and more laws which seem a little scary

958
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,290
like the Florida law if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

959
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,320
ourselves we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get bad law</font>

960
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:06,210
imposed on us and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

961
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last question since i'm getting the</font>

962
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:55,380
time signals over there

963
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:57,080
yes no pressure yes so many

964
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,850
organizations have this information

965
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">pressing them to disclose is a great</font>

966
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:04,470
thing many of them also suffer pressure

967
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,450
in the opposite direction where

968
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,020
corporate lobbyists will show up and say

969
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:11,430
don't just close this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there</font>

970
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,580
have been very public comments from the

971
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC saying that they believe they need</font>

972
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:22,740
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and better disclosure from</font>

973
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:25,470
companies and on the clear response of

974
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,750
the corporate lawyers is our vaguely

975
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,520
worded disclosures are perfectly good

976
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,700
when we lose a billion dollars to a

977
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,830
whale trader trading without authority

978
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:37,230
why aren't they good enough for this and

979
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:40,160
so there's there is pressure in the

980
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,840
other direction which goes back to thee

981
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,700
does it increase my bottom line does it

982
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,050
decrease does it increase the top line

983
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,359
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> change in my cost doesn't make</font>

984
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,120
my product better and if not the company

985
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,600
doesn't really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it so I think</font>

986
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to tell our organizations</font>

987
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,009
we need to tell our friends we need to

988
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,560
say it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start talking about</font>

989
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things because if we do things</font>

990
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,580
will get better so put some pressure on

991
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,580
folks thank you

992
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,009
you
