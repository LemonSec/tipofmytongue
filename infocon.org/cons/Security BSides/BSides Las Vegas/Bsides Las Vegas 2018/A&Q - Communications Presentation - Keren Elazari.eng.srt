1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
as was not expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> I received an</font>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,210
invitation to speak at a conference

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,090
called Ted at the 30th<font color="#CCCCCC"> anniversary of</font>

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,250
Ted so for those of you not<font color="#CCCCCC"> male with</font>

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,719
Ted it's a pretty cool event that

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,670
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years</font>

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,439
now and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> videotape all the talks</font>

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,689
there and then the talks go on the

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,869
website and get watched by millions of

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,779
people and I was overwhelmed terrified

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,929
excited and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking oh my god I</font>

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,410
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely going to get hacked for</font>

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,870
talking about hackers at Ted because you

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,910
know just like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy said earlier how</font>

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,250
am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the story accessible</font>

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,040
to the public and not you know enrage

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,899
the hackers and because I was so certain

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,300
that was going to get hacked I set my

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,210
mother and my father down for a talk and

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,940
I explained to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that people are you</font>

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,649
know might want to hack them so they

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,539
could get to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found myself</font>

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,329
explaining stuff like two factor

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,100
authentication and spearfishing and all

25
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,680
kinds of complicated concepts like that

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,540
to my parents and then I realized

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,330
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually realized two things</font>

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,670
the first thing was that Randall from

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,740
XKCD I don't know if you know the comic

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,799
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm big fan I realized he was going</font>

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,110
to speak at the same session at Ted as I

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,610
was and that was like relieved okay all

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,740
the hackers are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna watch his</font>

34
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,229
talk nobody's going to notice me that's

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,449
fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> but more seriously I had a bigger</font>

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,150
realization that was that I was getting

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,860
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hack</font>

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,470
into people's brains tacking to their

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,259
minds to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> plant an idea and the</font>

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,750
very public platform so non-security

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,960
audience to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like my mother</font>

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,340
or your mother's or my dad people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not in the security industry and</font>

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,350
explain to them how hackers can actually

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,509
be a positive thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just a</font>

46
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,600
criminal thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what most people</font>

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,960
outside our little echo chamber think of

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,449
hackers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,449
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I found to do that and took</font>

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,180
me a long time to you know give myself

51
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,030
up to it is that I created a virus

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,819
really I created something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,780
to try and stick into people's minds and

54
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,819
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I crystal</font>

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,250
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> with coming up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one simple</font>

56
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,739
idea that I hoped would get people

57
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,740
engaged and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then would be easy for them</font>

58
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,310
to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> on words kind of like virus and</font>

59
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,069
my virus or my idea was that hackers can

60
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">be seen as the immune system for the</font>

61
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:36,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">information age because it falls to</font>

62
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,680
hackers to ultimately and inevitably

63
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,679
find the vulnerable aspects in our

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,709
rapidly changing world and force the

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,540
rest of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix things and you</font>

66
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,850
know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very humbled and excited and</font>

67
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,100
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it worked I</font>

68
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,160
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspired by the words of Barnaby</font>

69
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,540
Jack delayed Barnaby Jack who said you

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,820
know sometimes hackers have to

71
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,459
demonstrate the threat in order to spark

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">a solution and when I took to the Ted</font>

73
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,019
stage I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how people</font>

74
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to you know love hate the idea</font>

75
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:13,090
of hackers as a positive force but as it

76
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,489
turns out more than 750,000 people have

77
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,440
seen the talking Sheridan so I think

78
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's safe to say that the virus kind of</font>

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,459
caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> on very proud and humbled to say</font>

80
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,200
that so right now I want to share with

81
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,329
you a couple of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I</font>

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,030
learned on the process when I was

83
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,489
crafting the talk because Ted they kind

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,140
of invented this format right for the

85
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,209
short talks and the ideas worth

86
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,488
spreading and they invested a lot of

87
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,829
time in coaching the Ted speakers and I

88
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,660
got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know good speaking</font>

89
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,730
training out of it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of kind of pass on a few of these</font>

91
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,030
ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly to you and then</font>

92
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:48,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer any questions that you might have</font>

93
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,109
about communicating and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font>

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to people outside there in the power</font>

95
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,209
industry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our community so the first</font>

96
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,280
thing perhaps the most important thing

97
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:59,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to remember kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the takeaway idea</font>

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,560
here is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mind the gap</font>

99
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,059
there is a gap between ourselves the

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,739
security industry the security community

101
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,870
the people that come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to DEFCON the</font>

102
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,450
people that come to my hacker events in

103
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,090
tel aviv israel and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,399
world is Congress people<font color="#E5E5E5"> or financial</font>

105
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,728
industry people or car manufacturers and

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,950
in order to bridge that gap we have to

107
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,950
reach out we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put our hand out</font>

108
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,240
there and kind of bring people over that

109
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,670
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a gradual</font>

110
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,400
process and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share a few</font>

111
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do that so again borrowing from</font>

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,690
XKCD my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> webcomic this is kind</font>

113
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,090
of like a map of<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet communities</font>

114
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,490
one of the best piece of advice I got

115
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,539
from the Ted speaking coaches was to

116
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,940
look at the talk like a journey like a

117
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,770
journey from point eight that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

118
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,260
some place that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience knows very</font>

119
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,450
well like facebook and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

120
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,150
problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and bug bounties</font>

121
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,830
at Facebook etc but going from there

122
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">someplace that the audience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows well</font>

123
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,200
taking them like a tour guide as it were

124
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,630
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world in all kinds of dark</font>

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,909
places and illuminating things and ideas

126
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they perhaps did not see before</font>

127
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,990
they're not think about before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

128
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,540
you might find yourself beyond the Great

129
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,520
Firewall of China talking about internet

130
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,170
censorship and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about values and</font>

131
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,210
civil liberties and why the engine is so

132
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,000
important and by connecting these two

133
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,789
places by taking the audience from point

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,500
A to point B if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

135
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,700
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know it doesn't</font>

136
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">really matter the type of background</font>

137
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,170
that the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> has if you can take</font>

138
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,990
them from point A to B they will be

139
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">grateful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you being that tour guide</font>

140
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,410
being that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's reached out and</font>

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000

145
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,740
learn and you know I've embraced that

146
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,230
advice and it's been extremely

147
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,110
instrumental and helpful I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

148
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so when we do go when we embark on</font>

149
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this journey there is something we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

150
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,340
to watch out from and you know how the

151
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,370
maps<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the old days used to say here be</font>

152
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,830
dragons don't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

153
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,490
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of try and build on that and</font>

154
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,560
say here be jargons we have to watch out

155
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,910
from jargons and terms and you know

156
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,140
obfuscating our bilateral conversations

157
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,020
because that's exactly the sort of thing

158
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gets people away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from our message</font>

159
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,169
and a kind of thumb rule piece of advice

160
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,479
whenever you're talking to an audience

161
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,070
that has different backgrounds most

162
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,470
chances are that an average audience

163
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,469
outside of security industry they could

164
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:39,190
probably latch on to one or maybe two

165
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:41,030
you know concepts ideas new terms right

166
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,940
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain zero they</font>

167
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,309
abilities that's great go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do that</font>

168
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,090
but don't be throwing in you know

169
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,490
malware polymorphism or DNS fast flux or

170
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">malvern izing because that's the stuff</font>

171
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,580
that's good that's going to freak them

172
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,610
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh no that's too complicated</font>

173
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I can handle that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff if you do</font>

174
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bite-size and you take one</font>

175
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,479
term at a time and really don't overload

176
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,050
it you'll find that you get more effect

177
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,970
in your communicating and speaking of

178
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,890
terms you know one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

179
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,380
do have in our industry we love terms

180
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,479
with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> jar guns we have terms that</font>

181
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,060
sound very impressive like cyber attack

182
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,920
but are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind of vague have you</font>

183
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,650
ever heard or seen like a headline that

184
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,540
says millions of cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks are</font>

185
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,940
stopped each day right have you seen

186
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,470
those so I always questioned those

187
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,690
headlines and I'm saying okay what are

188
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:36,050
they counting is it millions of packets

189
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,810
is it millions port scans is it millions

190
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,420
of infected endpoint devices is it

191
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,540
millions of communication sessions to

192
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,520
the botnet C&C server what are they

193
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,990
counting so if you want to use terms

194
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,659
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of vague and not</font>

195
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,460
specifically that's fine as long as you

196
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,860
kind of bring up to the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

197
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,409
say this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn that i'm using make</font>

198
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,640
it concrete you some numbers use some

199
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,890
facts no talking about facts another

200
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,659
thing that I learned and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh</font>

201
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,180
mentioned this earlier is how important

202
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,560
the power of storytelling is right we

203
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,690
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's an effective way to</font>

204
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,610
communicate but one thing we don't

205
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,800
usually realize is that different

206
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,020
audience members even<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

207
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,760
different people here resonate with

208
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,620
different stories and they might come

209
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,570
away remembering one thing like maybe

210
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll walk out and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

211
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,960
cool how you know Bo save the lives or

212
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,430
those premature born infants with the

213
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,949
incubators or you might be thinking

214
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,570
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Congress persons and talk and</font>

215
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,790
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other guys that he was</font>

216
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioning so one thing that I learned</font>

217
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,339
to do is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use all kinds of</font>

218
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">different stories and in my 16 minutes a</font>

219
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">TED I had between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight and ten</font>

220
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,120
different stories or anecdotes that kind

221
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of resonated with different audiences</font>

222
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,830
and then you know on average every

223
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,600
minute if you see if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

224
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,730
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute every two minutes I had a</font>

225
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,500
different story different anecdote so

226
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,930
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the audience can resonate with</font>

227
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,700
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if they don't another part of</font>

228
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relate to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

229
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,400
point and so that's show-and-tell for

230
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:12,770
you now I have a question moving on to

231
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,300
my next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one can anyone tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me or you</font>

232
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,090
know maybe off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of your heads</font>

233
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,859
what's one major phenomena that's caused

234
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:25,810
major power outages in the United States

235
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:29,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">has also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped trading on NASDAQ twice</font>

236
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you guys are great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

237
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,250
that is the unexpected answer that it is

238
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,200
squirrels it's true New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> Times did a</font>

239
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,670
piece on that and last August where they

240
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,590
kind of did a pretty extensive review of

241
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,930
all the cases that squirrels it actually

242
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,790
caused power outages and this is a very

243
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,089
serious problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet you don't see</font>

244
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,040
billions of dollars poured into

245
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,340
persistent squirrel repellent technology

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,069
right it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that way and this</font>

247
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,560
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I mean one one aspect of that</font>

248
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,200
problem I think is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud right</font>

249
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,829
the fear uncertainty and doubt of cyber

250
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,260
warfare is something that serves<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

251
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:09,410
know certain government agencies certain

252
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,420
vendors certain stakeholders at keeping

253
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,089
the discussion a very high level with

254
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,939
very scary terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you know fear</font>

255
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,860
it's a scare tactic and a control tactic

256
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,080
but it kind of breaks away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

257
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality so what I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to suggest</font>

258
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,490
you guys again when<font color="#CCCCCC"> your guys and girls</font>

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,370
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're communicating to various</font>

260
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,160
audiences is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fight the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fud and</font>

261
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,950
you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with facts simple facts</font>

262
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,319
right you know show numbers show detail

263
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,600
not just anecdotes but have those back

264
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,090
top and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be a valuable</font>

265
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,120
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add to your storytelling as it</font>

266
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:47,560
were now another aspect of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud</font>

267
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,720
situation is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fudd flows both ways</font>

268
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,390
that means that no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only is you know</font>

269
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government or some vendors putting</font>

270
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,980
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> food out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

271
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,140
influenced by fun Congress people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

272
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,290
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> senators etc are also</font>

273
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,939
influenced by it now as long as those

274
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,040
decision-making algorithms are not going

275
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,620
to change what we have to do as a

276
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,779
community

277
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,580
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed the inputs that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

278
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">into their decision-making algorithms</font>

279
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,990
and you've heard lot today about being

280
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,089
at the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know initiating</font>

281
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,520
engaging those conversations I think

282
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:24,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a powerful tool for change in</font>

283
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:26,460
just a year so much has happened all

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,110
right just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know before I move out</font>

285
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:33,690
to the Q&A part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inq or the</font>

286
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:36,360
answering questions part just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

287
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of resources so one question that you</font>

288
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,350
might have before you're communicating

289
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,910

question or a comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why don't I</font>

348
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:07,019
get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of started with it so</font>

349
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your often get asked by people</font>

350
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:11,099
what's the biggest challenge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

351
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">have communicating do you have a</font>

352
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">question go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

353
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,238
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat the question for</font>

354
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:45,019
the audio recording the question was how

355
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:46,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to really impact some change with the</font>

356
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,069
way upper management and your

357
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:51,738
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> views the security and IT</font>

358
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:55,040
investments right that I kind of get it

359
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:58,910
right so again I would go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

360
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,269
square one start with why why should

361
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,790
they care about security and usually

362
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,730
with with upper management it is not

363
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,189
things like security and vague risks

364
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,720
because a<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk is kind of like a threat</font>

365
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,449
that might happen it might not happen

366
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sort of thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really not what</font>

367
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:18,618
they usually care about what they care

368
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is number one bottom line how much</font>

369
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">money are they making how much money are</font>

370
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,169
they saving how much growth are they

371
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,618
showing their stockholders or private

372
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:29,389
shareholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> year-on-year and if you can</font>

373
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:32,269
find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to craft your messaging</font>

374
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:35,179
surrounding that and showing how a

375
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,999
relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> small investment in security</font>

376
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:40,339
and design<font color="#CCCCCC"> and development phases will</font>

377
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:43,339
we know significantly impact the way

378
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:45,559
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> save money on security down</font>

379
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,869
the line that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

380
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:51,969
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some more practical advice I</font>

381
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,970
want to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk that Bo gave at</font>

382
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:57,110
Circle City con about a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I've</font>

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,959
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video of it and to talk about</font>

384
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,610
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like managing your managers</font>

385
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,219
and think it was called or talking to

386
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,869
executive managers and he you know

387
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,639
that's a great resource like an hour

388
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:10,339
long talk with lots of techniques and

389
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:13,040
explanations on how to kind of fuzz the

390
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,589
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the way upper management</font>

391
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,089
and usually executives see things and

392
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,329
understand things and how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

393
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:21,949
security into that protocol using kind

394
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:23,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like back doors although it's not</font>

395
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,889
really a back door right talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

396
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,749
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line how much money are they</font>

397
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,579
making another side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is just like</font>

398
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:34,189
the Pope is he a congressman or a

399
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:36,699
senator or<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay loop the the nice</font>

400
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:39,230
professor that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking here earlier</font>

401
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:41,809
he gave the example of how Tesla is

402
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,579
benefiting from the good PR that they're

403
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:45,689
getting by doing what they're doing with

404
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:47,849
security so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what industry</font>

405
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,010
what kind of company you're in but

406
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,100
that's another approach and creating a

407
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,569
positive public image or even

408
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,390
eliminating the chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> for negative</font>

409
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,740
public image because that maybe even you

410
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what a bigger concerns of them</font>

411
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:07,490
right and i saw i think another question

412
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,490
by someone yeah

413
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:33,220
you know where the term<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fudd came from</font>

414
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:37,210
where it originated fear uncertainty and

415
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:40,299
doubt it was a sales technique by IBM

416
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,149
when an ex-employee of IBM<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime in</font>

417
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:45,610
the 70s branched off from<font color="#E5E5E5"> IBM started</font>

418
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:48,340
another company a competing company with

419
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,639
a competing business model to IBM and

420
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,379
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sales people of ib IBM use fear</font>

421
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:56,110
uncertainty and doubt to dissuade people

422
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:59,370
from buying that company's product and

423
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,350
that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably</font>

424
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,469
persistent term nobody ever got fired

425
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,928
for buying idea you heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but to</font>

426
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:11,379
really you know return to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

427
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:14,320
have i seen a change yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

428
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:16,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">much so i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually right now this</font>

429
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think it's it's</font>

430
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:21,129
coincidental that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am the cavalry is</font>

431
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,158
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now that def cotton has</font>

432
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:27,519
so many tracks and talks dedicated to

433
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,230
the positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact that security in all</font>

434
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,330
sides you know all aspects of the

435
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,830
industry can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm also seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

436
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the organizations that I</font>

437
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak with I speak to a lot of like</font>

438
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,220
financial industry and government

439
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,139
agencies and defense contractors and

440
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,389
what they're beginning to see is not

441
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:45,820
just a risk and fear and how they should

442
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:47,830
invest in security but also see things

443
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">like security as a business enabler</font>

444
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,370
having you know better secure product is

445
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to mean we're going to sell more</font>

446
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:58,689
of them or at least we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

447
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:01,360
a bad negative image if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

448
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,100
efforts to secure our product so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

449
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,990
seeing that whether it is like more

450
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,360
driven by the carrot or the stick

451
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,370
remains to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen but I am definitely</font>

452
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,168
seeing that positive side and you know

453
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,299
you might say I'm naive or a hacker

454
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,190
cheerleader or whatever but in the past

455
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,230
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really you know seen</font>

456
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,049
more and more people can go back to

457
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">those old-school hacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ethic values of</font>

458
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,639
doing really important good stuff and

459
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,710
influencing technology in the good way

461
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,269
hopeful when I see that

462
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:46,320
yeah so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting investing in</font>

463
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,090
security as a competitive advantage and

464
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,860
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you come off as a brand</font>

465
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,260
that's investing in security are

466
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,330
positive incentives for companies to

467
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,370
invest in security and that might go

468
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,990
back to your company and another

469
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,500
question from this guy no you were just

470

yay I heart Iron Dome this is actually

487
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,740
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made it out here because in</font>

488
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,320
the past month<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so I've been living in</font>

489
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tel Aviv under rocket attacks and iron</font>

490
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,090
dome is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the active missile defense</font>

491
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,639
system that's been intercepting the

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,100
rockets fired at Tel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aviv in other parts</font>

493
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,460
of Israel now this is done where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

494
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to go political don't worry so</font>

495
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,540
here's the thing last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week Brian Krebs</font>

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,889
broke a story about how hackers

497
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,960
allegedly affiliated with the now

498
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:22,450
notorious Chinese unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> 613 89 hacked</font>

499
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,430
into the defense firm the israeli

500
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,010
defense firms that built Iron Dome and

501
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,080
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies like III Israeli</font>

502
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,460
aerospace industries and Rafael and

503
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,189
others these are the equivalence of

504
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,680
Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin but

505
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,380
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel and the story kind of evolved</font>

506
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,390
from there and then BBC reported on it

507
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">again but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> firm's were infiltrated by</font>

508
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,490
Chinese hackers now here's the point I

509
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,510
want to make about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story about these</font>

510
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,060
companies get

511
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,129
hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these stories right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now in</font>

512
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Israel it doesn't really matter if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

513
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,620
story is true or not it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

514
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,410
matter what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> was leaked or stolen</font>

515
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,050
or breached for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

516
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,240
Israeli<font color="#E5E5E5"> public and also around the world</font>

517
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,649
because last week the US Congress was

518
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,130
also deciding on whether they should

519
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,800
approve more funding for joint R&D

520
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,860
efforts on Iron Dome as far as everybody

521
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,850
is concerned Iron Dome everything is

522
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,620
hacked you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to my hairdresser</font>

523
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a few days ago and obviously he's</font>

524
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,939
an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> person in my life and he</font>

525
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,800
was well working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my hair he said okay</font>

526
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,140
so what's going on care and I heard the

527
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,760
Chinese are now you know targeting the

528
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,470
rockets and they're controlling iron

529
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,879
dome they're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in Beijing</font>

530
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,700
and they're controlling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iron Dome are we</font>

531
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,430
safe are we safe and again the story

532
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,260
propagated you know from BBC<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Business</font>

533
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,450
Insider to the Guardian the Chinese

534
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,250
hackers stole this stuff now what if in

535
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,590
effect has happened what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

536
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">according to all the information that I</font>

537
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,419
actually saw about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

538
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,790
happened is that possibly two out of the

539
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,980
three firms that were implicated were

540
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,790
probably breached like three years ago

541
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in 2011 and it was their web facing you</font>

542
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:07,010
know document chair portal whatever and

543
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,220
they had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents about other</font>

544
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,430
missile systems and to go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

545
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,040
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese people in beijing or</font>

546
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,200
now controlling iron dome is a big big

547
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,600
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but for my hairdresser</font>

548
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,790
he doesn't get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference all he</font>

549
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,830
has now is the feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the system</font>

550
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,290
that's in protecting him<font color="#CCCCCC"> is been</font>

551
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">controlled by somebody else that's the</font>

552
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,420
risk of you know letting the fad of

553
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,180
cyberwarfare getting out there in the

554
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,280
world and for me that's one motivation

555
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,380
to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and explain exactly</font>

556
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,710
what happened and trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>
