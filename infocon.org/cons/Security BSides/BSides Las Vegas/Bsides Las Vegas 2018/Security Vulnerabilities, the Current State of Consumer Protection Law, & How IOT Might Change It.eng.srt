so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stalker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee came out of this</font>

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,529
tweet from well pond back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in October of</font>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,809
this past year he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking about Tom</font>

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,759
manufacturers a lot of times make legal

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,049
threats to security researchers when

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,450
they're disclosing vulnerabilities and

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,420
he's pointing out like hey consumers

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,340
can't really make legal threats when

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,439
they buy software and it's broken and

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,539
something happens they really don't have

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">a voice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way to use the legal system</font>

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,470
right now as I guess having<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gone</font>

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,760
through a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of law school I</font>

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,650
understand why but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,090
complicated and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be</font>

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,160
interesting sort of explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,570
why that is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of talk</font>

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,190
these days about software product

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,649
liability last year's black hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

20
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,510
lot about it it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fuzzy and so I</font>

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,190
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the current state of</font>

22
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,480
it and why it might actually start

23
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,530
changing not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of</font>

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but because</font>

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,539
Internet of Things is going to change

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,920
some stuff that affects the reasons why

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,739
we haven't had software product

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,539
liability so far so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's start out by</font>

29
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">comparing two different situations let's</font>

30
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,930
say you go to target<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy a coffee</font>

31
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,850
maker and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it home you plug it</font>

32
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,700
in and something happens the glass

33
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,950
carafe has a flaw in it and it explodes

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,770
and cuts your wrists or it catches fire

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,530
or something and this instance is a

36
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,270
consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have medical bills</font>

37
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,570
and you can go to the person who made

38
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">your coffee maker sue them in a court</font>

39
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,039
and have them pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your medical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bills</font>

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,990
this happens all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time with with</font>

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,150
defective products but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's compare</font>

42
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to another consumer who buys a</font>

43
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,990
router chippings at home and plugs it

44
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,900
into her home office and there's a flaw

45
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,789
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software on the router and all of</font>

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
her information gets exposed she<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes to</font>

47
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,720
identity theft and so forth this

48
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,100
consumer does not really have any

49
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,890
recourse under our system right now

50
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">she's also been harmed but she can't</font>

51
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,170
bring a suit or she could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

52
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,640
tossed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of court</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quickly so</font>

53
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">why what is the actual difference</font>

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,700
between these two situations we have to

55
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,439
consumers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are harmed by products</font>

56
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,119
that they bought and they're facing

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,969
fundamentally different situations in

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,430
the court so start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that I need to</font>

59
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain to you a little bit about how</font>

60
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the American legal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system works so</font>

61
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally if there's an agreement</font>

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,619
between two people as a contract this is

63
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,900
super common in the software world we

64
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,300
have quick wraps we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> EULA's we have</font>

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,790
terms

66
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,920
service and essentially how the American

67
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal system works is that if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,410
contract and something happens any sort

69
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,179
of damages or so forth are going to be

70
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,640
governed by this contract so basically

71
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,590
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is some really grievous</font>

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,410
physical harm what happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

73
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,090
contract gets governed by that contract

74
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,230
on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand you might get harmed</font>

75
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,660
by someone who you don't have an

76
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">agreement with we have car accidents</font>

77
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe a roller coaster goes flying off</font>

78
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,250
of the track we use tort law to address

79
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,080
that tort law is for when someone out

80
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,790
there who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not in an existing</font>

81
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,100
agreement with her too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you</font>

82
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,230
how your medical bills paid for and

83
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,579
product liability law is a subset of

84
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,869
tort law it's the law that governs

85
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,570
basically it purchases or products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

86
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,730
if those products are defective so let's

87
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,769
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what you need for a product</font>

88
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,810
liability suit and our legal system

89
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,120
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than what we</font>

90
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,220
call pure economic loss you need a

91
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,410
physical harm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the consumer like that</font>

92
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,510
glass carafe exploded and cut your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrist</font>

93
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,160
or something or you need property damage

94
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,160
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coffee maker caught fire and it</font>

95
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,560
burned your kitchen so now let's think

96
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what happens with the Internet of</font>

97
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,970
Things software has always just been on

98
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,500
our computers and we've had buggy

99
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,060
software we've had problems caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

100
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,160
software but it was not capable of

101
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,250
causing any physical harm out in the

102
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,720
real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this changes with IOT we</font>

103
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,640
have software and fridges if someone

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,260
hacks into your fridge and raises the

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,208
temperature of it your food could go bad

106
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,070
it could cause you to get sick we have

107
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,020
software and drones a drunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> could fall</font>

108
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,070
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sky and hurt you this had been a</font>

109
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:57,400
really fundamental or there's this

110
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,600
really fundamental shift in the sorts of

111
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
ways that software is going to be

112
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">interacting with the real world that</font>

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,890
changes one of the fundamental

114
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,450
assumptions that we've always had about

115
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,200
why there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no such thing as software</font>

116
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,910
product liability so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

117
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,859
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time that software or</font>

118
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,150
that product liability might be changing

119
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,400
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

120
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">nineteen sixteen there's a very</font>

121
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,079
influential case that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of developed</font>

122
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,960
the product liability as we know it

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">today is called mcpherson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buick</font>

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,880
sky went and you bought a<font color="#E5E5E5"> car from a</font>

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Buick</font>

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,109
time they made wheels out of wood and

128
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,669
there was a flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one of his wooden</font>

129
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,580
wheels he's driving down the road<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

130
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wood breaks the car crashes he's</font>

132
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,800
dealer and he's like hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font>

133
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,120
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that car that I</font>

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,860
bought from you and it entered me and

135
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,260
I'd like you to pay my medical bills and

136

dealer does<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well sure there was a</font>

137
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,219
flaw but that came from the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

built<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car all I did was sell it to</font>

139
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,180
you so essentially the guy who bought

140
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,799
the car and the seller were what we call

141

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal world in privity they had</font>

142
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,610
an agreement but the guy who bought the

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,590
car was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in privity with the person</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">who introduced the defect and so the</font>

146
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,340
court said oh we have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font>

147
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,130
was injured and he can't have his

148
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,659
medical bills paid for and as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> society</font>

149
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,130
at that time they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving away from</font>

150
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">you everybody being a farmer or buying</font>

151
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,909
things and general stores where you knew

152
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:23,390
the person who is selling products to

153
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,910
you and they were shifting towards you

154
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,250
know mass production supply chains and

155
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,500
so forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Court recognized that</font>

156
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,050
this was a change and they decided to

157
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,850
allow the guy who bought the Buick to go

158
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,070
recover from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built the</font>

159
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,300
defective product and so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed</font>

160
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,849
the idea of basically the ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

161
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,790
have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical bills or ever paid for</font>

162
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">from anyone who had built a product or</font>

163
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,930
sold it to you anywhere up and down that

164
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">chain so in the courts we recognize</font>

165
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,630
three different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of defects these</font>

166
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,250
have all developed mostly since the

167
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,990
nineteen sixteen case we have

168
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
manufacturing defect which is probably

169
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,230
what a lot of people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I</font>

170
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,760
think about defective products that

171
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be like that flaw on the glass of</font>

172
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the coffee maker this one instance of a</font>

173
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,150
product came off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the factory line and</font>

174
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,670
there was a problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we also have</font>

175
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">we call a design defect so maybe that</font>

176
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:22,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">coffee maker was built such that if it's</font>

177
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,380
on for more than three hours it might

178
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,690
overheat it could catch fire it cause

179
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,190
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a little switch or</font>

180
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,020
something that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffeemaker</font>

181
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,900
manufacturer could have installed in the

182
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,549
coffee maker but chose not to and so if

183
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,020
it catches fire the consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

184
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,460
court and be like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just a</font>

185
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">really poorly designed product you</font>

186
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,620
probably should have put that

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,349
wouldn't have cost that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and it</font>

188
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,449
would have eliminated the danger and

189
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:46,830
finally we have failure to warn failure

190
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,249
to warn is the reason why your mcdonalds

191
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,878
coffee cups a warning this is hot and

192
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:55,289
why there's stickers all over everything

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,659
so in that instance maybe we can say the

194
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">coffeemaker you know as a tendency to</font>

195
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,659
overheat after 30 minutes but we could

196
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,159
just put a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> sticker on it until</font>

197
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,349
the consumer you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't leave this</font>

198
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,240
on for more than 30 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

199
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,340
will allow the consumer to be aware of

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,199
this problem and take action to prevent

201
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,909
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> product liability is what we call</font>

202
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,949
strict liability which is liability

203
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:19,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">without fault and it sort of feeds into</font>

204
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:22,139
the question of why can you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

205
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,669
knives but you can't buy lawn darts if

206
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,680
we think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are both sharp</font>

207
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,779
objects that could injure you and yet

208
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,939
one is freely available in the American

209
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,770
consumer market and the reason is really

210
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,469
risk utility balancing and that is also

211
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why product liability is not</font>

212
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,998
really strict liability so

213
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,180
foreseeability and obvious dangers

214
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:44,189
really play a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big part in this so an</font>

215
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,080
obvious danger like a knife you know I

216
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,550
can look at it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be like yeah I</font>

217
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,680
can see that this is something that

218
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,080
could hurt me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's really useful we</font>

219
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,789
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to buy knives or you</font>

220
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,688
know I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and cook dinner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

221
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,729
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot of problems</font>

222
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,490
preparing my dinner or s lawn darts

223
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:01,349
they're fun they're sharp they're not

224
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,680
super useful our society is kind of

225
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,599
running without them right now the

226
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,539
foreseeability also plays into how you

227
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,240
use a product so if i buy a stepladder

228
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:14,639
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decide to do something really dumb</font>

229
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,259
and set it up in a rowboat and I climb

230
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">up on the step ladder in the rowboat and</font>

231
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,810
it collapses and I now broke my leg if I

232
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,089
go to the manufacturer and I'm like hey

233
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,789
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> injured by you know your step</font>

234
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,560
ladder they're going to go like in a

235
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,300
rowboat no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen like</font>

236
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,519
that's completely not foreseeable you

237
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,019
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something dumb there I could</font>

238
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,279
take a coffee maker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could mount it on</font>

239
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,169
a drone because I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be lazy and I</font>

240
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,599
want my<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee to come get delivered to</font>

241
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,029
me over on my sofa and then someone

242
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,529
hacks into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drone and causes it to</font>

243
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,199
you know sort of wobble in the air and

244
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,019
it dumps a hot coffee on me like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

245
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,699
a legit stupid thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing you are</font>

246
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:55,560
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recover under</font>

247
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,270
sort of scheme so some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons</font>

248
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,400
why we have product liability really is

249
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it serves an insurance function our</font>

250
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">society has decided to sort of push the</font>

251
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,610
burden and making products safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

252
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,730
manufacturers rather than requiring

253
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,920
every consumer to be their own you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

254
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,390
consumers research sort of people and

255
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,010
have to go investigate whether these

256
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,620
products are safe you know I can go to a

257
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,270
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can purchase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a blender and I'm</font>

258
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,640
not super concerned that this blender is

259
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,949
really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> harm me because i have</font>

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,840
this reasonable expectation that if i

261
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,820
buy this product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

262
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,220
fairly ordinary way that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,690
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to harm me and</font>

264
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that might start</font>

265
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,280
changing with IOT so the people who

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,250
build blenders are totally used to

267
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,579
building blenders however they're not

268
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:44,430
really totally used to building software

269
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,200
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common it is</font>

270
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,120
for them to build blenders<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be</font>

271
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,970
upgraded do they have experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

272
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,160
accepting reports from the security

273
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,160
community about vulnerabilities do they

274
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,319
understand what sorts of features they

275
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,180
should put in to be secure there have

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,770
been things with Lake IOT<font color="#E5E5E5"> teakettles</font>

277
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,969
that were leaking Wi-Fi credentials

278
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,829
because they were just poorly designed

279
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,360
from a software side and all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

280
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,800
likely yeah that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid you</font>

281
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,990
know but we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font>

282
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,790
building software these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

283
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,200
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put software into things</font>

284
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interact at the world do not</font>

285
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,360
yet have that background so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

286
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,980
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool we could empower consumers and</font>

287
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,290
they could use software product

288
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,820
liability but that's a big fuzzy thing

289
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,050
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would this actually work in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

290
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,850
court you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the court</font>

291
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,599
and be like I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should have</font>

292
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this sort of a liability so failure to</font>

293
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,770
warn is one framework we could use and

294
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,930
one way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could think specifically</font>

295
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,010
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it may be software companies</font>

296
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,780
or companies that are using software

297
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,740
should have to warn about known

298
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,230
vulnerabilities failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to warn is a</font>

299
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,820
pretty well-developed field in product

300
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,010
liability and it really breaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> down into</font>

301
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,480
two components one of them is the risk

302
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,850
reduction warning like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to use this chainsaw wear goggles we</font>

304
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,030
could think about that in a software

305
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,829
world by saying hey if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">run this particular software make sure</font>

307

you know go do these particular

310
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,920

little bit safer<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you or we have</font>

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,710
choice warning is incredibly common in

314
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,230
the pharmaceutical world we tell the

315
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,660
consumer there are these risks out there

316
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,890
they exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to let you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think about that in the software world</font>

320
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,750
we could say well the software has<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

321
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,340
this vulnerability and we're going to

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you about it and you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

out in your network how to set it up and

327
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,689
protect it now one of the things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is a failure to warn might</font>

provide incentives for better software

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,870
development practices we can think about

331
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,020
encouraging the people who are making

actually needs to be addressed or not

348
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,740
and that's something that companies that

this is complete warning overload and

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,960
we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling</font>

take in no information and we're back at

00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,790
base 0 they haven't actually been

364
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,800
effectively warned about anything

365
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,490
there's limited amounts of attention

366
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,050
that people have you need to think too

367
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,760
about weather warnings are reasonable

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we all joke about the warning</font>

on the McDonald's coffee cup of warning

370
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is really hot like okay yes I know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font>

372
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,860
do I actually still even read it should

373
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,620
I have been warned about something else

374
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,540
if we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that consumers have limited</font>

375
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,480
amounts of intelligence and we tell them

376
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,550
30 different things but we bury the most

377
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,769
important warning in number 30 is that

378
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,319
really an effective morning and one that

379
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,149
particularly concerns me with separate

380
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,319
boner abilities is what if we have

381
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:34,759
people warned about unpatched

382
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:38,120
vulnerabilities you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this</font>

383
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:39,829
report we need to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but</font>

384
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,509
we have no plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> to patch is that just</font>

385
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:45,128
going to be a big like hey go reverse

386
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:49,790
engineer this particular thing over here

387
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,870
so obvious risks I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this image you</font>

388
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,849
might not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read it it says</font>

389
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,999
please make sure you have made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

390
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:00,649
decision it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little ducky I can plug</font>

391
00:13:55,999 --> 00:14:02,329
in that is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect warning I so</font>

392
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,009
enjoy to warn you should have known is

393
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,529
completely obvious if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you notice your</font>

394
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,720
kitchen knives at home do not

395
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,249
necessarily say warning sharp because

396
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys should all know that knives are</font>

397
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:15,980
sharp this also allows you to it plays

398
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,389
into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for see a building if you</font>

399
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,970
thing when I talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know like</font>

400
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,649
hey what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use a stepladder and a</font>

401
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,680
rowboat and that's a dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

402
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,930
do if you just have bad security

403
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,540
practices you know and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

404
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:34,189
root cause of your harm that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

405
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,189
protect a software creator so people

406
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:39,410
freak out a lot when they hear about

407
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:42,379
software product liability and open

408
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,120
source it turns out that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

409
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:48,889
analogize to some existing product

410
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,420
liability doctrines so for one there's a

411
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,040
big focus on commercial sellers a

412
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,170
product liability you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really go to</font>

413
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,389
like an etsy seller and be like hey your

414
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,949
product is defective<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could try but</font>

415
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're it's probably not going to go</font>

416
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,939
anywhere in the courts but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

417
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,099
that is a little more important only

418
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:06,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about open source is the component</font>

419
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,589
product liability<font color="#E5E5E5"> the product liability</font>

420
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,269
understands if you build a gear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

421
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,740
goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a machine and machine goes</font>

422
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,440
into our product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the consumer buys</font>

423
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,390
it and there's some problem like in the

424
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,580
engine in this product<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person who</font>

425
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">built the gear that goes in is not</font>

426
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,410
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person on which the liability</font>

427
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,280
is going to be pin like yes we have

428
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,810
liability for the retailer we have

429
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,640
liability for you and supply chain of

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,260
assembled the engine but the component

432
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,760
itself would be deemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> too you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

433
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,080
will say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this little individual</font>

434
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,210
product here they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just went into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

435
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,280
larger defective product is not

436
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,580
responsible for the harm and therefore

437
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can exclude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them from liability so we</font>

438
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">can take all this I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how does</font>

439
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,100
this relate to the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> currently</font>

440
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,150
develop and patch software especially as

441
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,660
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be putting these into</font>

442
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:57,380
IOT devices so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about what</font>

443
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,910
happened after nineteen sixteen when we

444
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,350
had our poor guy who bought the Buick

445
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know dumped him on the</font>

446
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,960
highway consumer safety really increased

447
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,270
in large part we got used to how to

448
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,310
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in factories we develop</font>

449
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:14,210
standardized practices for mass

450
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,859
production so the Buick case is kind of

451
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of as a trigger case</font>

452
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,480
it caused the law to adjust because

453
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,610
society had changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to</font>

454
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,550
develop sort of this insurance function

455
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,670
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to allow us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort</font>

456
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk of these products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

457
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,150
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who we thought were in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

458
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:36,490
position to handle them and this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

459
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:39,860
shift could happen again<font color="#E5E5E5"> with IOT so</font>

460
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:42,200
with IOT we're really now having

461
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,270
software that can cause these physical

462
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,630
harms and physical harms are something

463
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,980
that we're used to having liability for

464
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,870
we can say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know right now a lot of</font>

465
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,610
IOT products are released to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

466
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,850
questionable security practices a lot of

467
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,650
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to patch and</font>

468
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:01,760
using software product liability as a

469
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,530
way to affect basically as a lever to

470
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,220
make those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> safer is something</font>

471
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,770
that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us protect consumers so</font>

472
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,890
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so much not a perfect solution</font>

473
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,839
there's tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems we talked about</font>

474
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens if it's an unpatched</font>

475
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,260
vulnerabilities should we warn people

476
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,449
about it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this maybe this</font>

477
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,490
informed choice morning like hey there's

478
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,559
a bug over here we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

479
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,199
about it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide to keep using</font>

480
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,580
it a lot of times you say software

481
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,260
liability and people go oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my god</font>

482
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,090
innovation we're really concerned about

483
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has really driven</font>

484
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,129
our industry to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the success that it</font>

485
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,260
is and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want people in their</font>

486
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,370
garages or small companies to be

487
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">burdened by this sort of scheme we also</font>

488
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,550
if we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> warn about</font>

489
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,100
vulnerabilities seriously need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font>

490
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,149
about the warning overload fatigue

491
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,870
anybody in this industry knows the

492
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,920
number of security vulnerability

493
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,689
announcements that are made and patches

494
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,679
and we joke about patch fatigue this is

495
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:04,370
actually a serious problem so let's

496
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where do we go from here we</font>

497
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,580
do not necessarily have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of</font>

498
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,559
liability but we do have a standard set

499
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,570
of practices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us agree on</font>

500
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,280
you should be testing there are

501
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,409
guidelines out there and how to prove

502
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,639
your software development lifecycle

503
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,420
people talk about using bug bounty

504
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,370
programs generally you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

505
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,570
already be taking reasonable care to put

506
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,340
safe products out in the market place

507
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm probably preaching to the choir and</font>

508
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,790
this one but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did ever get this</font>

509
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,590
sort of liability you could go be like

510
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,059
hey I am following standard industry

511
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,409
practices there should be a presumption

512
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:38,960
that I have fairly safe products here so

513
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,480
thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much i love talking about</font>

514
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff so come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

515
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,540
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for questions cool so is</font>

516
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:49,540
anybody questions awesome

517
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,629
so crystal ball five years from now what

518
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,600
do you think the reasonable standard of

519
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,940
care will be for IOT providers for what

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,219
providers for people who make like these

521
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,200
Internet of Things devices um I think

522
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely and I am a web developer so</font>

523
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
most of my development<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience comes</font>

524
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,480
from that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> riffat middleware</font>

525
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,530
services are but things like being able

526
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,730
to patch alerting people about you know

527
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,820
what vulnerabilities you have and what

528
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,150
fixes are available getting your stuff

529
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,590
audited doing code reviews and following

530
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,150
what's out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the industry like</font>

531
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,250
the open web application security

532
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,690
guidelines is sort of you know well

533
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,420
agreed upon things that you should be

534
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,250
checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for red teaming your products</font>

535
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,200
and so forth you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

536
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,970
specifically what they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be but we're</font>

537
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving towards consensus for a lot of</font>

538
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in courts will look to that</font>

539
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,659
sort of thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what does the</font>

540
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,450
industry think is fairly standard just

541
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,450
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's your take on you know the</font>

542
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,740
whole Tesla crash with oh you know had

543
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,770
that kind of is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

544
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,290
wrapper of software and you know

545
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,059
consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> products so just cool yeah i am</font>

546
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,190
not super familiar with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tesla crash</font>

547
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,260
I did literally just spend three months

548
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,929
locked away with la block speaking for

549
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:11,309
the bar but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I me this is</font>

550
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:12,840
something where they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

551
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,990
sure that this is a safe product they

552
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,790
put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer hands if a</font>

553
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,460
consumer gets something you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

554
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a completely unexpected way and some</font>

555
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,420
harm happens like I'm not that concerned

556
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,550
that the consumer is using it and what

557
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,260
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fairly normal reasonable way</font>

558
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,149
and there's a bug and it causes a

559
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,750
problem that's where we would start

560
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:36,059
looking insanely well can we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you</font>

561
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,650
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a vulnerable is a sort of</font>

562
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,870
thing that liability would help protect

563
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consumer for but it's hard what</font>

564
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,770
happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the courts a lot is it's a</font>

565
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,420
lot of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk utility balancing</font>

566
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,090
it's a lot of economics it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

567
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,000
like how much would it have cost them to

568
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,980
make something that is really safe I

569
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,230
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like cars are unsafe cars are not</font>

570
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">square boxes of square wheels built out</font>

571
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred tons of steel because that</font>

572
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,709
would be safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it would be unusable</font>

573

other hands we don't have one darts you

599
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,940

600
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,529
these outlier court cases that will say

601
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,260
yes and not lower court cases to say no
