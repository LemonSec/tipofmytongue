26
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,360
um excellent first day uh we usually try

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,400
to do a policy refresh of like what were

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,439
the wins what's the pending legislation

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,799
or what's the attitude towards hackers

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,420
we kind of had some interruptions over

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,600
this thing from covet or whatnot so the

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,340
bad news is we haven't had an update in

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,380
a while the good news is a lot of really

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,119
important stuff happened including

35
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,420
passing the law uh including you're

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,100
gonna hear from uh prosecutorial

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,860
discretion for good faith research

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,900
so we want to have that family no

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
spoilers spoilers

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,360
um

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,400
but uh I mentioned this morning and this

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,079
is a perfect example of why to do it I

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,880
mentioned this morning that if you watch

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,280
the Cavalry launched nine years ago and

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,659
it's on video

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,220
um one of the things you have to put

47
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,140
yourself back in a nine-year-old period

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,299
Edward Snowden just happened distrust

49
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,619
between government hackers had never

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,939
been higher

51
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,759
uh we had seen some cyber physical

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,439
systems hacks and stunt hacking on

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,000
certain things but we didn't really have

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,860
any trust built and one of the deep

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,320
concerns that Nick percoco our

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,299
co-founder had was that we're going to

57
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,979
see increased criminalization of

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,840
good-based security research

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,080
and that was a very possible future

60
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,599
and don't just get an update of what's

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,300
happened last two years it's stunning to

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,980
see the plan that we had in place nine

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,420
years ago and how it is actually

64
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,879
matriculating and now how much Embrace

65
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,940
we have seen so uh we have three amazing

66
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,099
uh panelists here and they will

67
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,360
introduce themselves because they are

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,780
funnier than I am and um but look at

69
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,000
this not only as a milestone for what's

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,140
happened over the last two years and

71
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,760
where things are going but just think

72
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,319
how far we've come in nine years and

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,879
think how much further we could go if we

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,220
double down all right so let's welcome

75
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,879
our panel

76
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,239
uh thank you very much

77
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,400
um and just as a like a little Public

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Service Announcement before we get into

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,340
this one

80
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,099
um are you good can you can you hear me

81

okay uh

82
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,300
I don't know what that means

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,400
um uh so in one of the earlier sessions

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,599
people were talking about ransomware a

85
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,500
whole bunch

86
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,360
um for those that are going to be at

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,099
Defcon and I do know it's a party Foul

88
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,000
to mention another conference when

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
you're at one uh but there will be a

90
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,340
session in The Policy Department on

91
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
government responses to ransomware it's

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,180
a two-hour discussion it will involve

93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,519
the UK the US and Australian governments

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,019
and they want to hear from you guys so

95
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,400
if you have ideas on things that are not

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,140
being done that should be being done or

97
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,220
you want to hear what the stuff is that

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,019
they're already doing

99
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,239
um that session will be on Saturday from

100
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,640
four to six in the policy section

101
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,400
um at uh uh Defcon and I apologize

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
sincerely to all of the lovely besides

103
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,180
people that I've referenced everyone

104
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
um but it is an opportunity to to speak

105
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,180
with the government attendees on that

106
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,440
topic

107
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,540
um but that's not what we're here for

108
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,659
today uh so yeah so we're gonna do a

109
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,340
like a uh what's happening in policy

110
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,299
land

111
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,140
um and there are three sort of things

112
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,519
that we really wanted to cover which is

113
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,739
like how does it all work like how does

114
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,120
policy work what are the different parts

115
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,980
of the government doing how how do they

116
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,560
work together all of that kind of stuff

117
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,879
how can you guys get involved how can

118
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,860
you help influence it and and create

119
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,080
positive outcomes and then what's the

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
stuff that's actually happening what's

121
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,620
the status quo with things that kind of

122
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,919
thing to get like a bit of a level set

123
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,358
and make sure that we're using our time

124
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,040
wisely and in the right areas they're

125
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,540
going to interest you how many people in

126
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,919
the room feel that they're pretty sort

127
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,259
of up to date and cognizant on like how

128
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,419
the process works and like you know

129
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,280
how's the sausage made what does policy

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,479
look like and all that kind of stuff

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,280
who's brave enough to say that they

132
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
think that they are all right so it

133
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,000
seems like we can probably spend a bit

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
of time on that and some others will

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,780
find that useful awesome

136
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,720
um thank you for playing uh okay so um

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,419
I'm Jen Ellis uh I am rapid sevens VP of

138
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,620
community and public affairs a title

139
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,580
that no one knows what it means for

140
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,400
myself included uh and I work a lot with

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,620
governments around the world on how do

142
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,720
you Advance Security for everybody right

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,060
how do you create society change

144
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,960
um that is what I do

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
it's my accent

146
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
and also that I don't know how to use

147
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,120
microphones

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,560
uh

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,900
okay I'm just gonna awkwardly Lean

150
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,860
Forward

151
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,440
um yeah so uh it's funny actually

152
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,639
because normally I'm told there are

153
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,900
people who can hear me in the UK without

154
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,720
a microphone when I'm in the US

155
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,440
um

156
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,600
so yeah so we're going to talk about how

157
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,979
policy Works how you guys can get

158
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,419
involved and what's going on in policy

159
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,500
land

160
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
um you know Josh mentioned nine years

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,580
ago when the Cavalry started uh and

162
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,919
funnily enough nine years ago Josh and I

163
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,120
were at

164
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
Derby con

165
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
and we sat down and just went I'm

166
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,460
starting this thing I'm really worried

167
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,699
about the intersection of physical and

168
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,020
virtual and the potential for it to

169
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,180
create harm I'm starting this thing and

170
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,500
I was like I'm starting this thing I'm

171
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,180
really worried about the legal impact

172
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,400
for security research and the chilling

173
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
effect and we looked at each other and

174
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,800
we were like

175
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
are we starting the same thing at the

176
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
same time what is that and then we

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,020
realized they were super complementary

178
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,880
not the same just super super

179
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,100
complementary so we ended up kind of on

180
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,080
the hill going and talking to policy

181
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,819
makers and like I would reference his

182
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,199
work and I would reference the Cavalry

183
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,419
in my briefings on security research

184
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,500
because you know it was a great

185
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,479
opportunity to talk about the importance

186
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,520
of security research when you can say

187
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,259
and researchers are these great

188
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,940
protectors who want to like you know

189
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,560
save the world and protect people from

190
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,780
that intersection of I'm going to use a

191
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,479
Josh communism where bits and bites meet

192
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,720
fashion blood uh and so I was able to

193
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,460
hook him up and you know I'm gonna just

194
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,660
give him the benefit of the doubt that

195
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,440
he did the same for me

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,680
okay so that's a little bit about me um

197
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,940
I'm now going to hand off to Jack and

198
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,100
Leonard to introduce themselves

199
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,080
sounds like I'm being volunteered to go

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
first so I'm jack cable I am a security

201
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,020
researcher which is what we call hackers

202
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,000
when we're talking to policy makers to

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,099
make them less scared of hackers so if

204
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,720
you haven't caught on yet that is a good

205
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,880
tactic to make people think you aren't

206
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
like this scary figure in a hoodie even

207
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,599
though you are

208
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,900
um so I um have worked in a number of

209
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,599
government agencies including sisa U.S

210
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,160
cyber security infrastructure Security

211
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,500
Agency on Election security uh

212
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,240
Department of Defense working on their

213
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,979
hack the Pentagon program which was

214
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,680
bringing in hackers to help secure the

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
US government through bug Bounty

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,060
programs um and most recently doing a

217
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,160
fellowship in the Senate

218
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,979
um so kind of spanning get both the

219
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,900
executive branch and legislative branch

220
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,479
and looking forward to our conversation

221
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,180
today

222
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,580
and good afternoon I'm Leonard Bailey uh

223
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,560
I am a special counsel for National

224
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,479
Security and head of the cyber security

225
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,539
unit which is what I call myself to make

226
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,360
sure I don't scare hackers uh I'm also I

227
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,520
guess a prosecutor federally

228
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,620
um uh I I've been at the department for

229
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,020
31. the search gave you away I know I

230
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,000
know I I guess I said to Jen I tried to

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,160
make spot the FED as simple as possible

232
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,599
so

233
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,280
um and so yeah I've been working this

234
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,680
area for about 20 20 years and I've been

235
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,419
in the department in a lot of different

236
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,000
capacities I will say that that that

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,220
conversation about chilling security

238
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,280
research uh what what happened there was

239
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,860
now I think it was 2014

240
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,319
um Jen and some colleagues came to my

241
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,400
office of computer crime and

242
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,979
intellectual property section and um

243
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,379
basically said your ways are strange to

244
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,139
us but but they're chilling research and

245
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,120
the chief my section heard that and he

246
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,640
said we don't want to do that we think

247
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,979
there's there's legitimacy to having p

248
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,059
people who are trying to solve the

249
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,099
problem on the playing field and so we

250
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,779
embarked on what has been a multi-year

251
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,000
effort um and we'll go over I think you

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,019
know some of the high points over that

253
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,159
that time

254
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,860
um to figure out how we could better

255
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,560
message what we try to do

256
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,240
um which is actually try to go after

257
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,740
people who are trying to victimize

258
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
others

259
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,800
um rather than you know at worst people

260
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
who are trying to do the right thing in

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
the wrong way

262
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,200
um and so uh just to add to that story

263
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
so that meeting happened towards the end

264
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
of June and during the course of the

265
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,380
meeting when they didn't instantly throw

266
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,779
us out and tell us that we were idiots

267
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,220
uh we said hey if this is a thing you're

268
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,120
interested in learning more about

269
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,339
there's this thing happening in Vegas in

270
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,620
a few weeks you guys should come out

271
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,940
we'll introduce you to some people you

272
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,380
can hear about it firsthand from

273
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,459
researchers

274
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,019
and they looked at us and they were like

275
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,040
Vegas

276
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,019
we're the Department of Justice and you

277
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,480
said weeks and then a month later in

278
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,300
August

279
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,380
a month later I get an email from

280
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,120
Leonard saying I've booked flights in a

281
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,580
hotel can we still do this and it was

282
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,100
the first time you came out to hack a

283
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,620
summer camp right and he has been here

284
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,620
every year since that's nine years even

285
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,040
the last two years

286
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,800
not there and he has spoken every year

287
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,080
since because he has made a huge effort

288
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,300
to basically try and build a bridge

289
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,620
between his community and our community

290
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,120
and I think Jack does the same thing

291
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,980
from the opposite side as a researcher

292
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,079
working in government he's building that

293
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,600
same bridge and I just think these touch

294
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,339
points these sort of entry points and

295
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,160
and uh these points where we create this

296
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,540
two-way dialogue is super super super

297
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,000
valuable and important so I think these

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
two people being on stage is just

299
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
incredibly important and I would

300
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,800
actually like it if you would give them

301
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
a round of applause for the work that

302
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
they do thank you

303
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,740
it's deserved it's dessert all right now

304
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,300
we'll get substance stuff now that we've

305
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,720
done the cheesy moment so you were going

306
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,399
to do I think like a little bit of a how

307
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
does it all work together yes so I I'm

308
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,180
gonna I'm

309
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,079
I'm sorry I'm gonna get a little

310
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,700
Schoolhouse Rock on you for a moment so

311
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
I want to talk a little bit about how

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,360
the government works um and I imagine a

313
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,740
lot of you are familiar with the

314
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,880
government

315
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,940
um but the last few years has for me at

316
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,579
least suggested that maybe not everyone

317
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,140
really understands how the government

318
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,500
works uh and and so I wanted to just

319
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,060
sort of break things out just for a

320
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,500
couple minutes

321
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,079
um and how many of you are lawyers

322
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,600
I I'm a Juris freaking Doctor does that

323
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,820
matter does that okay only a couple good

324
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,620
okay so

325
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,940
very quickly

326
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,440
um obviously we have the three branches

327
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,420
we have con you know Congress we have

328
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,740
the exact branch and you have the

329
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,540
judicial branch um you know congress

330
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,440
makes the rules they they pass the laws

331
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,019
that tell others what to do so for

332
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,519
example the government

333
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,760
can only do what is authorized to do so

334
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,500
we have to look for some statute or some

335
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,839
authorization in the Constitution to to

336
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,060
do whatever we want to do

337
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,500
um we don't just get to do what we want

338
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,779
uh we have to have it moored in some

339
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,399
some statute or some Authority in the

340
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,420
Constitution

341
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,060
so uh the executive branch not

342
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,820
surprisingly executes the law right so

343
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,000
we do what Congress tells us

344
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
what they authorize us to do

345
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,860
um and then though there's this one

346
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,540
little space where we kind of get to

347
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,000
make law generally the executive branch

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,220
does not make law but

349
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,260
in discrete areas Congress is able to

350
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,860
say hey look there's this issue

351
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,279
it's complicated we're going to give you

352
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,959
the guard rails on what we want you to

353
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,240
do but you fill in the rest of it and

354
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,800
that's essentially what the regulatory

355
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,779
authority of different agencies are so

356
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,940
you have like the FTC right the Federal

357
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,800
Trade Commission or the FCC or the FCC

358
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,139
or independent agencies where Congress

359
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,040
has said

360
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,860
okay you deal with

361
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,680
publicly traded organizations and you

362
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,480
come up with guidelines that's your

363
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
mission go and that agency is able to

364
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,019
make up rules that guide that and they

365
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,459
have a rulemaking process where they

366
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,320
have public comment

367
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,579
um you know they invite people to

368
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,079
comment on on the role they're

369
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,880
promulgating and then they take that in

370
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,639
and they they produce a rule uh and then

371
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,279
sometimes people say wait you've you're

372
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,899
now exercising too much Authority that's

373
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,420
past what Congress said was was okay and

374
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,920
so you may have a Judiciary step in

375
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,019
which is not supposed to make law but

376
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,459
it's supposed to interpret whether the

377
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,800
law is being Faithfully applied so

378
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,860
they're supposed to essentially say wait

379
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,139
um you've overstepped your bounds um and

380
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,980
you you will have to to stop that now

381
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,560
this is an elaborate Rube Goldberg

382
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,139
device that is not built for efficiency

383
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,740
or speed right the whole purpose of this

384
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,060
is to make sure that there's no

385
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,880
institution or individual who has so

386
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,560
much power that they can essentially

387
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,839
assert tyrannical rule over other

388
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,720
parties in in the system so this is the

389
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,519
way he sort of checks and balances work

390
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,519
it messy it's messy but there are

391
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
opportunities in each of these channels

392
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,740
to have some policy impact and we're

393
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,180
going to be able to talk a bit about

394
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,279
that now but I just want to lay out

395
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,680
these different these areas

396
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,019
yeah and I think you know you you talked

397
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,720
about how Congress can set boundaries

398
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,660
and or guard rails and then there can be

399
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,600
an ongoing uh role but that also happens

400
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,579
on a project basis sometimes right so

401
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,620
like we saw that with something like the

402
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,300
iot cyber security Improvement Act Right

403
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,699
Congress passed the law and said but

404
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,380
nist is going to figure out the details

405
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,560
and we just saw it recently with cersea

406
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,660
right same thing if this is incident

407
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,100
reporting

408
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,660
um where Congress said hey we need to

409
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,880
have internal reporting and then it's

410
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
like super important let's pass law on

411
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
it and then let's give scissor three and

412
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,860
a half years to figure out the details

413
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,420
um yeah so but so which I'm sure is

414
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,459
working on Super urgently

415
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,160
um yeah perfect

416
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,459
um so it happens on a like on a for

417
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,019
Regulatory Agencies it happens on an

418
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,579
ongoing basis but then you also see it

419
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,500
happening on a sort of ad hoc project

420
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,320
basis very much sort of hand in hand

421
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,139
with the law passing process and it's

422
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,060
important to understand those two halves

423
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,519
because you can influence them either

424
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,440
side of the law passing potentially if

425
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,779
that makes sense

426
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,040
okay

427
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,079
um okay anything anything else on like

428
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,300
how it does anyone have any questions on

429
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,579
the how these parts work together before

430
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:05,180
we move on

431
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,040
okay all right um so we talked about

432
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,139
like all the different pieces

433
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,240
I mean I'll ask you jack like let's talk

434
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,260
a little bit about how people get

435
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,959
involved how do you work with these

436
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,279
different parts like I just said you can

437
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,660
work on either side of the law being

438
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,240
passed how what does that look like

439
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,820
yes so and I think a starting point for

440
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,500
this and of course there's I'll start

441
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,699
with Congress again to a little

442
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,440
executive branch I'm sure Leonard can go

443
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,940
into that more

444
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,019
um but

445
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,639
um in in terms of kind of thinking

446
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,259
through and yeah it goes back to the

447
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,300
Schoolhouse Rock I'll spare you the the

448
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,519
singing of it but um

449
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,480
essentially how uh Bill Works through

450
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,940
the ways in Congress but even broader

451
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,500
than that just the different tools in

452
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,199
the toolkit coming from Congress and

453
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,459
kind of yeah we're all familiar with

454
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,500
bills setting law but beyond that

455
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,320
Congress has oversight functions where

456
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,019
it can do stuff it can hold hearings it

457
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,579
can write letters it can ask hard

458
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:02,639
questions that's not setting law but

459
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
still kind of keeping the executive

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
branch in check

461
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,540
um so

462
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,639
that's one area where kind of when

463
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,560
you're thinking of okay how how should

464
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,259
this policy problem be tackled

465
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:17,519
um I would encourage you to think

466
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,820
broader than just say kind of would a

467
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,540
bill solve this but maybe is it due to

468
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,220
something not working as well as it

469
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,959
should be in the executive branch is

470
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,940
maybe something outside in the private

471
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,860
sector that

472
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,300
um some more attention could be brought

473
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,100
to but kind of the different tools in

474
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,560
the toolkit when it comes to

475
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,199
um kind of making policy and then

476
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,060
specifically with bills and kind of how

477
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,240
to get involved um I I think one area

478
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,579
that at least wasn't clear to me before

479
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,160
kind of I came into Congress was the

480
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,220
importance of committees uh where

481
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,720
Congress divides itself up into

482
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,279
different committees which handle

483
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,259
different jurisdictions there's for

484
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,759
instance the armed services committee

485
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,740
which handles all matters related to

486
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,779
defense Foreign Relations Committee

487
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,699
handles matters related to Foreign

488
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:06,839
Affairs

489
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,199
um and in order for a bill to move that

490
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,380
relates to one of these jurisdictions it

491
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,599
must get cleared by that committee

492
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,699
um so that means that especially the

493
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,199
chair the head of the committee and the

494
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,020
ranking member which is the top

495
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,039
um Congress person of the minority party

496
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,199
um has a lot of influence in not only

497
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,780
determining what bills get in or what

498
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,900
bills don't move forward but also

499
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,299
um say what's in those bills

500
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,179
um so I I think being able to kind of

501
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,460
identify these say when we're talking

502
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,140
about cyber security policy the

503
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,940
Committees that are especially relevant

504
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,520
a lot of those are for instance the

505
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,260
homeland security committees in the

506
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,760
house and the Senate um the house

507
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,919
oversight committee

508
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,960
um the Commerce committees

509
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,840
um when you're thinking of say nist or

510
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
um ntia

511
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,200
um and then

512
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
um the armed services committee as well

513
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
for kind of some of the

514
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,380
um and intelligence committees for some

515
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,760
of the more kind of intelligence

516
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,700
Community aspects of cyber security so

517
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,299
identifying kind of who the

518
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,179
um say staffers are there is one way to

519
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,580
be able to influence more than say

520
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,559
talking to a member who might not be on

521
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,360
the relevant committee

522
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,919
um and that's where a lot of kind of the

523
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
relevant subject matter or expertise

524
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,640
lies as well on committees

525
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,100
um so that's the the Congress view

526
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,440
um I'll let yeah Leonard get in just

527
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,880
should we do that just quick show of

528
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
hands how many people here have ever

529
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,419
reached out to a member of Congress

530
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,799
about a policy issue okay and uh

531
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,320
who did that by email

532
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
who phoned

533
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,700
okay interesting

534
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,140
um

535
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,600
sorry

536
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,700
but how do you get the face face did you

537
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,880
meet them somewhere

538
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,919
over there okay

539
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,020
hey I mean honestly the stuff is of the

540
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,700
people that get things done

541
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,960
so

542
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,299
um and everyone starts somewhere

543
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,600
um okay uh and

544
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,640
of the people who put their hands up how

545
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,020
many of those were committee staff

546
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,299
rather than your local representative

547
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,500
uh so the people who have talked to

548
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,380
Congress how much was it committee staff

549
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,780
so who who went to committee committees

550
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,240
community members or committee staff as

551
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,620
opposed to going to your local

552
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,600
representative

553
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,740
okay

554
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,360
all right interesting

555
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,959
thank you

556
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,460
yep okay well so in the executive branch

557
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,380
it's it's a little complicated there's

558
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,880
there's no simple answer and part of the

559
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,720
reason I wanted to break out that

560
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
regulatory agency

561
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,679
um issue is because you know those are

562
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,660
agencies that have a a ready-made

563
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
process for people to get involved right

564
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,160
so they do a a notice that they're going

565
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,980
to be rule making and a solicit comment

566
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,260
and and those comments actually truly

567
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460
matter

568
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,720
um in talking to Regulatory Agencies

569
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,020
it's not the question of numbers because

570
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,880
it's not really it's not about voting

571
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,000
it's about the sophistication

572
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,880
um and accuracy and rigor of of the

573
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,659
comment

574
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:21,419
and people with technical understanding

575
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,179
of the way in which a law might impact a

576
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,159
community or an issue

577
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,179
actually have a louder voice when people

578
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,640
review the comments

579
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
um you know obviously you know 100

580
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,919
people saying this law sucks or this

581
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,600
rule sucks you know it's not going to be

582
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,419
as effective as someone who can dissect

583
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,419
the rule you know in a very exacting way

584
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,940
and explain why it's it's a problem and

585
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,140
so in that way I would say that people

586
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,240
in this room in sort of a rule making

587
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,299
process may have a louder voice in some

588
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,820
ways than than others who are commenting

589
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,020
on something and would have something to

590
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,580
bring to the discussion that others

591
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,320
others may not

592
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,240
now once you get outside that sphere

593
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,020
though um I would say that it's a little

594
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,220
harder for anyone to just have impact on

595
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,280
on Executive Branch policy making

596
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,900
um I can say like for example the

597
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,220
Department of Justice

598
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,340
we're not an agency that that takes

599
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,320
comment on the things that we do by and

600
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,940
large right

601
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,039
um but like people for over and over

602
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,799
again she does she does

603
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,679
um and so you know it it depends on how

604
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,559
you want to make make some impact

605
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,260
I will I will say though that there is

606
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,240
some um I mean people have succeeded

607
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,039
that there have been sort of lobbying

608
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,400
efforts of of of individuals in the

609
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,539
administration for example in our

610
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,059
security Council or other places

611
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,039
um and one reason I would just say that

612
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,600
that might

613
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,059
make more sense now than it has in the

614
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,460
past is because I don't know if you've

615
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,260
noticed but there's a certain bit of

616
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,960
gridlock on on the hill

617
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
um that has made it harder to get

618
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,179
legislation passed right

619
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,059
as a result executive Authority is being

620
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,280
used perhaps more more often you're

621
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,900
seeing more executive orders that deal

622
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,700
with specific issues like cyber security

623
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
and that's because it's something that

624
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,380
the detective Branch can do unilaterally

625
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,640
um the one thing I'll flag about

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,260
executive orders though that is not

627
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,780
always well understood is that

628
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,400
again as I said the executive branch

629
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,440
doesn't get to just make laws

630
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,900
an executive order has to be based on

631
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,020
some statutory Authority that exists

632
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,900
or it has to to reside on you know

633
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,340
Authority that resides somewhere in the

634
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,539
Constitution that sort of the organic

635
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,240
authority of the executive branch so you

636
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,200
know if you're in the area of national

637
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
security or foreign policy

638
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,039
the executive branch has kind of

639
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,320
constitutional authorities there but

640
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,059
when you get to other areas you know it

641
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,559
really is a question of finding what the

642
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,740
statute Authority that that that

643
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,900
undergirds the executive order

644
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,120
if though you're in the space in which

645
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,880
the executive can actually use an

646
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,620
executive order there's a good amount

647
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,419
that the executive can do and I think

648
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,919
we'll get the specifics later like the

649
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,820
executive order or one four or oh

650
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,039
the most recent um I was going to be

651
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,260
impressed then that's no good okay

652
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,679
um the the Biden cyber security uh exact

653
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,860
order that came down in May of of 2021.

654
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,220
um that that's an example of you know

655
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,020
basically the executive branch turning

656
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,140
to its own personnel and saying

657
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,120
do better and this is the way that that

658
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,580
I'm I'm directing you to do that

659
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,220
just to emphasize one point that Leonard

660
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,919
made is when you're kind of advocating

661
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,320
for something the more specific you can

662
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,059
be the better

663
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,620
um so if you can say rather than just

664
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,059
saying kind of there's a problem here if

665
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,039
you could point to kind of specific if

666
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,260
it's a draft bill or something point to

667
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,440
the specific area and say no I think the

668
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,760
reason this is wrong and if you can

669
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,940
articulate kind of the

670
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,799
policy the harm that might be there and

671
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,659
say Here's a suggestion for how you can

672
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,179
make this better kind of when that gets

673
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,340
to either the hill staff or or the

674
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,020
person doing the rulemaking at the

675
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,179
agency they can then kind of assess what

676
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,640
you've said and then they have kind of

677
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,900
the solution right there in front of

678
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,940
them so they're a lot more likely to um

679
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,279
take that into account if you don't know

680
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,320
the solution that's okay too though

681
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,059
right

682
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,100
um when we started out and we were going

683
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,840
to them and we were saying hey the cfaa

684
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,100
is creating a chilling effect on

685
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,500
security researchers we didn't have an

686
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,360
easy and this is how you should fix the

687
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,860
language

688
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,020
um and actually it was a really really

689
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,539
super iterative process because it turns

690
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,340
out when I kept saying like just remove

691
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,620
the Civil causes of action nobody went

692
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,179
oh that's a great idea that's really

693
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,159
easy we should do that

694
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,220
um uh even though they don't exist in

695
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,779
any other country's laws

696
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,460
um uh but yeah so it doesn't if you

697
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,020
don't have a solution to offer that's

698
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,980
okay

699
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,000
you can say to the policy maker I don't

700
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,260
have a solution to offer right now but

701
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,820
I'd be happy to work with you on this

702
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,580
and I like I've been very fortunate I

703
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,380
have found that frequently people really

704
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,700
appreciate that sort of iterative

705
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,220
process and and will happily work with

706
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,419
you on it

707
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,279
um

708
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,500
just before we move off this topic and

709
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,940
move into like what is happening and

710
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,559
what we've seen in the past couple of

711
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,940
years

712
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,679
um you know I think we mentioned a

713
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,299
little bit things like letters that you

714
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,760
can do and they tend to have more of an

715
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
impact if you have more of a sort of

716
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
ground swap behind you

717
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,340
um you know more people signed on more

718
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,679
amplification that kind of thing and so

719
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,600
you know as as individuals sitting here

720
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,860
you might be thinking well how can I do

721
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,600
that I think this is actually an area

722
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,159
where you can look to the Cavalry right

723
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,140
like if you you know Cavalry has a

724
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,760
community it has

725
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,960
um a slack Channel I'm looking at Josh

726
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,100
to be like it still has a slack channel

727
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,120
right

728
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,279
um a slack workspace

729
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
um if you see something and you think

730
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,279
it's a potential issue and you're

731
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,140
interested in it it's a really great

732
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,640
place to like put something out there

733
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,559
and say hey has anyone else seen this is

734
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,880
anyone else thinking about it worried

735
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,539
about it you can come to Josh or Bo

736
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,240
um you can email info at and say it and

737
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,059
we'll take a look at it and if there are

738
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,380
people interested and we think it sort

739
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,059
of aligns with cavalry's overall goals

740
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,100
we can help draft a letter right like

741
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,600
that that's the thing that could come

742
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,539
from I am the Cavalry which then has

743
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,580
perhaps a little bit more impact than

744
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,100
coming from you know Joe blogs on their

745
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,460
own and and not only can we like maybe

746
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,020
do something for my recovery but it

747
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,039
turns out we actually know a lot of

748
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,840
other people we know a lot of other

749
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,299
organizations and

750
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,039
um we can go around to some of them and

751
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,720
say hey we've got this letter would you

752
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,400
potentially be interested in signing on

753
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,440
which we do all the time for letters

754
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,140
right and so you like don't feel like

755
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,539
you're in it alone there is a an

756
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,940
amplification effect and there is power

757
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,279
in numbers of people in this room all

758
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,260
working together and collaborating and I

759
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,820
think that is really what the Cavalry is

760
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,620
all about is sort of harnessing that

761
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,940
sort of strength that you guys all bring

762
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,100
with your individual passion and and

763
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,679
knowledge and expertise but all together

764
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,900
we can create more from it

765
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
um so just that was the last thing I

766
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,840
want to say on that piece and then we'll

767
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,179
get into what's been happening nothing's

768
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,260
happened right it's been a really quiet

769
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,559
few years nothing's happened

770
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,760
uh so should we start with security

771
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,240
research and so is the topic of my heart

772
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,380
uh so how many people are familiar with

773
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,840
sort of challenges around

774
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,580
um legislation chilling security

775
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,020
research

776
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,580
is this a thing that people care about I

777
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,260
have heard about

778
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,299
you guys are my people

779
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,760
um all right so uh I think there are

780
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,860
probably two main main pieces of law

781
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,500
that when I started

782
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,240
um on on my little bandwagon nine years

783
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,240
ago were the sort of primary uh problems

784
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,039
one was the computer forward and Abuse

785
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,419
Act which is the main anti-hacking law

786
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,460
in the US and the other was the

787
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,460
traditional Millennium Copyright Act uh

788
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,419
which

789
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,700
um aims to basically protect copyright

790
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,039
uh I know that's my non-loyal version

791
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,020
that's my Juris freaking doctorate

792
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,399
version

793
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,039
um and I will say over the past nine

794
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,179
years we've made

795
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,640
decent progress on one

796
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,620
last progress on the other we always

797
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,840
knew the other one was gonna be harder

798
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,899
um so the digital medium Copyright Act

799
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,820
has an exemption now for security

800
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,419
research and it has had that since 2015.

801
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,600
yes yes

802
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,899
a year later yeah twin yeah

803
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:33,020
um

804
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,580
no they're re-optimating and then they

805
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,580
re-upped again in 21. yeah so it's been

806
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,679
re-upped twice yeah 15 the first time

807
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,960
yeah wow okay

808
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,279
um this is why I have a Juris freaking

809
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,899
Doctor that's right

810
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:48,000
um so yeah so they because they passed

811
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,799
it in 15 but said a year and then it

812
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,080
came in in 60 I think I'm terrible with

813
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,580
years but I think that's right

814
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,440
um I'm I'm believing in me who is a

815
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
lawyer and she's saying yes

816
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,539
um so uh it's got a little stronger

817
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,279
every year which is the good thing right

818
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,200
they've like removed some of the the

819
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,240
boundaries part of the reason for that

820
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,500
has actually been support from the

821
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,940
Department of Justice

822
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,500
um who've written letters in support of

823
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,580
it

824
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,500
um I think more recently we've seen

825
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,020
we've seen ntia in support

826
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,720
um I think FTC have been in support

827
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,399
um I think maybe recently scissors been

828
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,140
in sport so there is like there's a

829
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,220
there's an increasing government

830
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,559
understanding of the importance and the

831
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,320
value of security research and we've

832
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,520
seen it

833
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,740
um uh represented through this sort of

834
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,600
rulemaking process that that re-ups

835
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,779
every three years for the dmca so at

836
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,980
this point if you're a security

837
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,020
researcher and you own the technology

838
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,240
and you're testing it in a

839
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,419
non-production environment then like you

840
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,559
know as long as you're not breaking a

841
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,480
bunch of other laws you're probably good

842
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,860
um that's a huge step forward from where

843
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,299
we were honestly like there's a massive

844
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,700
step forward and we've seen actually a

845
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,860
shift in the attitudes of a lot of

846
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,559
companies who make technology in

847
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,880
understanding that that was coming like

848
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,679
I I remember quite clearly being in a

849
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,000
room with a bunch of Technology

850
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
manufacturers who had previously been

851
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,779
pretty anti-research in 2015 and then

852
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,059
them being like we're all working on

853
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,799
building our vulnerability disclosure

854
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,260
programs because we know it's coming and

855
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,440
we know we can no longer use the dmca

856
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,960
um so we have seen like a bit of a shift

857
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,940
there cultural shift the community for

858
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,020
an Abuse Act was always going to be

859
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,700
harder to change and so one of the ways

860
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,760
to look at influencing it was to look at

861
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,679
how it was being used by prosecutors

862
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,760
for just one moment because I think that

863
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,799
I understand that that was a rule making

864
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,779
process like we've already discussed

865
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,480
um there's a an odd statutory provision

866
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,840
in the dmca on the circumvention of of

867
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,340
copyright protection

868
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,940
um in section 1201 that mandates a

869
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,799
triennial process every three years a

870
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,360
Library of Congress has a rulemaking

871
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
process where they ask are there more

872
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,779
exemptions that we need to to create

873
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,340
here to to further these goals and one

874
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,720
of the discussions was a security

875
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,820
research exception

876
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,620
um we we did weigh in we did something

877
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,200
we don't usually do we we submitted a

878
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
formal letter in support of the the

879
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,220
exception and as

880
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,200
the folks who actually enforce the

881
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
criminal provisions of the dmca we had

882
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,399
the Library of Congress actually

883
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,340
listened to us um and so there was at

884
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,919
first a the the creation of the

885
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,659
exemption and then some expansion of it

886
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,059
subsequently on the cfaa

887
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:33,840
um

888
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,340
a little more complicated because the

889
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,380
dmca typically you're working on

890
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,000
something a piece of equipment or

891
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,360
software that you possess right it's

892
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,380
it's in your your possession uh when

893
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,640
you're dealing with let's say pen

894
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,039
testing remote you know testing of a a

895
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,740
server that doesn't belong to you uh

896
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,440
things get a little carrier and

897
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
um you know and we actually are a little

898
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,200
more skittish about that because the

899
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,779
potential of there being a problem is is

900
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,440
a bit greater uh now we've talked about

901
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,539
legislative fixes we've we've found it

902
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:07,740
kind of difficult to figure out how

903
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,419
exactly you carve out research without

904
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,760
also providing people who are trying to

905
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,840
do bad things

906
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,419
um I read the excuse to to still

907
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,980
continue doing bad things with under an

908
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,480
exemption

909
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,840
um but what we did end up doing and um

910
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,380
announcing in May of this year was uh

911
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,620
through policy so my office reviews

912
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,740
every indictment for a cfaa prosecution

913
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,480
across the country

914
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,539
um and so we're kind of we oversee the

915
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,000
statute uh which wasn't always the case

916
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,240
right that was in and South yeah in 2016

917
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,700
the department made that shift create

918
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,519
greater uniformity on how the CFA was

919
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,620
being applied across the country

920
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,980
um and so you know we have uh the

921
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,380
opportunity to promulgate policy in this

922
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,620
area and what we um have issued and

923
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,279
publicly available uh online is

924
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,899
um direction to the U.S attorney's

925
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,419
offices the you know

926
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,220
94 districts across the country that

927
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,220
prosecute Federal cases uh that they

928
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,500
should decline

929
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,480
um prosecutions where there was good

930
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,820
faith security research

931
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,140
um and that is sort of the

932
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,840
accessing a system for purposes of of

933
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,779
testing investigating

934
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,659
um or correcting a a security flaw or

935
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,720
vulnerability where that is done in a

936
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,100
manner that does not endanger Public

937
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,240
Health

938
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
um or or safety and where it's done uh

939
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,519
for purposes of improving security

940
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,240
um

941
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,580
and so that's essentially what what

942
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,100
we've been trying to

943
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,320
to get done in legislation but it's it's

944
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,620
very difficult to do frankly

945
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,220
um

946
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,820
here I will make a pitch to all of you

947
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,519
and this is a hobby horse I've been on

948
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,260
for years

949
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,539
um I think there's one way you can help

950
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,099
us help you

951
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,379
and that is

952
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,480
beginning way back in 2014 when I came

953
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,579
out and talked to security researchers I

954
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,199
was

955
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,139
told and convinced that basically having

956
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,820
a department come in and tell you how

957
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,159
you should do what you do is not going

958
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,379
to go really well right that's not going

959
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,480
to really take hold

960
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,020
um

961
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,760
but

962
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,339
having the community articulate norms

963
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,500
and standards about how security

964
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,119
research is supposed to be done what

965
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,500
it's supposed to look like

966
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,139
would allow us better to be able to

967
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,418
distinguish between people who are doing

968
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,460
the right thing and people who are

969
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,139
actually not

970
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,800
um

971
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,379
and it's not clear exactly what the

972
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,719
vehicle for that is and I've talked to

973
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,579
different people about this but

974
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,500
um I mean I it's something I would

975
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,119
encourage the community to kind of

976
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,380
consider and think about it there's some

977
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,119
way of of giving form to that all right

978
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,640
um I'm just gonna say momentarily that

979
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,240
that guidance that doj issued is a

980
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,200
really big deal

981
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,270
[Music]

982
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,660
application Pro

983
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,399
cess what the doj and the judicial

984
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,740
s

985
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:03,960
yes we do

986
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,480
um we also though assume that what we're

987
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,980
assuming about the intent of the actor

988
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,380
is in fact the intent of the actor so

989
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,040
like so building that into the the tests

990
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,720
seems like it makes some sense I don't

991
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,260
know to at least to us

992
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,079
repeat it

993
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,980
oh it that that us assuming an intent of

994
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,660
the actor seems even though that's

995
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,800
something that we ultimately have to

996
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,060
prove that is what we would want to be

997
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,800
the actual intent of the actor and

998
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
that's why it's reflected in the

999
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,820
standard we use regardless of what

1000
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,119
perhaps the individual is intending I

1001
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,180
mean we will want to understand we we

1002
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,380
want to believe that that's what they're

1003
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,940
doing we want the evidence to support

1004
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,560
that's what they're doing

1005
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,119
um ideally that is in fact what they're

1006
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,020
doing

1007
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,400
um

1008
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,660
if they have a different motive then

1009
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,780
you know we don't we're concerned that

1010
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,359
there may not be but you those things

1011
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,820
you're making is 100 on the money right

1012
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,940
we that this came up like we've talked

1013
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,220
about this for nine years and we've

1014
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,359
looked at like different ways of

1015
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,440
drafting language because we haven't

1016
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
given up on the CFA

1017
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,160
um or in fact other anti-hacking laws in

1018
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,240
other countries like I've been working

1019
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,400
on the CMA the computer misses act in

1020
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,520
the UK recently and what you're saying

1021
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,180
about looking at intent so in the UK UK

1022
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,200
law

1023
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,780
looks intense did you intend to do a

1024
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,820
thing but not motive

1025
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,339
and so you could say I intended to

1026
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,920
access that system without permission

1027
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,480
but I did it for like all the right

1028
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,099
reasons because I'm a researcher and

1029
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,060
they're like oh we don't care you

1030
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,920
intended to an escape's law

1031
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,640
um and so hi

1032
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,960
uh we had a speaker request for survival

1033
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,920
instructions

1034
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,119
it was really for these two I just

1035
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,020
wanted them to be prepared

1036
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,880
this is great I'm very happy with this

1037
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,140
thank you thank you very much

1038
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,520
this is amazing that's me thank you

1039
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,740
fantastic

1040
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,960
thank you thank you so much we

1041
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,560
appreciate it

1042
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,960
it was really I was really hoping they

1043
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,740
were going to make them run

1044
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,740
fantastic thank you

1045
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,140
um so yeah so we've been having a lot of

1046
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,640
conversations around that exact thing of

1047
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,320
like if you so for example I am very

1048
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,359
passionately anti-private sector

1049
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,359
hackback but I'm very passionately

1050
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,579
pro-security research

1051
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:50,760
often the activities that you undertake

1052
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,579
could look the same for those two things

1053
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:55,560
so how do I draw a line between them

1054
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,599
right exactly as you say if you're

1055
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,940
looking at just based on activity and

1056
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,260
you're missing out that piece of our

1057
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,780
motive it's a problem

1058
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,099
um but it is a challenge because you've

1059
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,720
got to work within the framework of the

1060
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,160
law and what it actually acknowledges

1061
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,900
and looks at

1062
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,640
um I think you know one of the things

1063
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,740
with the US version that we struggled

1064
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,980
with is if we said hey one condition or

1065
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,780
one

1066
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,500
characteristic of good faith security

1067
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,900
research is that you disclose your

1068
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,880
findings publicly what happens if you

1069
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,900
don't find anything

1070
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,220
are you basically saying like if you

1071
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,300
didn't find anything you broke the law

1072
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,740
but if you did find something you didn't

1073
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,359
that's not very fair

1074
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,020
so it is it is really it's it is really

1075
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,619
really hard to find language that works

1076
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,020
on this which is why nine years later we

1077
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,000
don't have an exemption for the CFA yet

1078
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,560
discovered yeah

1079
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,880
they're in jail their research was

1080
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,380
recovered to patch

1081
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,579
it was so I would be interested in

1082
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,700
knowing what that was because

1083
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,579
to our knowledge and CDT has also done

1084
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,440
the same scrub we've done

1085
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,560
we don't know of any security researcher

1086
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,579
that's been prosecuted in the last

1087
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:18,660
decade

1088
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,200
other than arguably weave for the 2012

1089
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,560
at T instant now it I don't know if it

1090
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,780
was a state prosecution or something

1091
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,280
else but I'd be interested just to make

1092
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,140
sure that our our understanding is right

1093
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,119
of what's what's going on yeah we've

1094
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,220
we've also done research on this and we

1095
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,560
don't have cases there are there are

1096
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,660
state laws for sure and actually

1097
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,400
interestingly

1098
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,520
Washington's equivalent of the cfaa

1099
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,440
actually does have a security research

1100
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,480
exemption it's the uh it's the it's the

1101
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Forefront of state laws on that

1102
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,020
um all right we're going to take some

1103
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,339
questions I do want to cover off some of

1104
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:56,160
the other laws that yeah sorry Jack the

1105
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,800
question marks run out of power would

1106
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
you repeat yeah sure absolutely not a

1107
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,420
problem yeah no no

1108
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,339
I think

1109
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,940
yeah

1110
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,660
so the question was

1111
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,040
um I think it was aimed specifically at

1112
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,440
doj is doj working with states to help

1113
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,599
influence their thinking around state

1114
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,579
laws and state prosecutions

1115
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,619
um on anti-hacking and security research

1116
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:43,020
so to be honest we haven't reached out

1117
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,060
in in the way that you suggested in part

1118
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,180
because of federalism

1119
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,339
um like States get to interpret their

1120
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,599
own laws uh and you know but there is

1121
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,819
potentially an impact from I mean every

1122
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:59,640
single state that has a law that is

1123
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,819
something that addresses hacking is

1124
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:04,440
patterned after the Computer Fraud and

1125
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,140
Abuse Act and so there is potentially

1126
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,380
sort of some impact on

1127
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,180
changing the way that the federal law is

1128
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,460
looked at and used yeah and I'm sorry

1129
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,440
the person

1130
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,579
sorry yeah just before we move off this

1131
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,520
one though also to say while I think I

1132
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,440
think Jay isn't

1133
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,380
people like CDT and the eff and

1134
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,800
sometimes ACLU they do there are also

1135
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,180
people like so my colleague Harley

1136
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,220
Geiger is the person who worked with

1137
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,740
Washington State to get the the research

1138
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,900
exemption and so like that's why I know

1139
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,160
about it because actually keeping up

1140
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,160
with all the states is super hard

1141
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,200
um and so again this is the thing if you

1142
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,460
hear about stuff that's happening in

1143
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,599
your state

1144
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,300
use the slack share the information help

1145
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
raise the flag on it and then we're

1146
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,400
better able to respond and to figure out

1147
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,020
you know how to get involved and

1148
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,119
influence hopefully sorry Jack go ahead

1149
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,220
yeah I do want to go back to a point

1150
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,900
that Leonard made earlier around

1151
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,420
creating norms for how to conduct This

1152
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,339
research because I agree that that is

1153
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,260
kind of an its Central area and one that

1154
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,720
I think we've made progress in

1155
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,960
um so shout out to amit's work with

1156
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,319
disclose.io which is creating norms for

1157
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,359
both the researcher side but then also

1158
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,119
for organizations to say okay this is

1159
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,640
how you can conduct security research

1160
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,339
against our company or our government

1161
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:29,339
agency and in the absence of exemptions

1162
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,859
in the law these um often vulnerability

1163
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,220
disclosure policies are really essential

1164
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,260
to guide researchers to understand okay

1165
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,640
this is what you're allowed to do

1166
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,040
including illegal Safe Harbor to say

1167
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,339
okay if you comply with the terms of our

1168
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,380
policy we will consider the this act to

1169
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,300
be authorized and we won't take legal

1170
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,500
action against you so kind of just doing

1171
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,079
that on organization by organization

1172
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,800
basis and for instance we've seen sisa

1173
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,680
issue a directive requiring all federal

1174
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,440
civilian executive branch agencies to

1175
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,200
start vulnerability disclosure policies

1176
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,280
authorizing security research against

1177
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,560
their systems so now you can go for

1178
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,480
pretty much any government agency you

1179
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,520
could go for doj and look for

1180
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,140
vulnerabilities in them and be

1181
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,119
authorized as long as you comply with

1182
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,800
their vulnerability disclosure policy

1183
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,500
we've seen this at the state level as

1184
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,440
well some states Iowa Ohio South

1185
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,960
Carolina for instance authorizing

1186
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,400
security research with vulnerability

1187
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,960
disclosure policies for their election

1188
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,140
systems at least those that you can

1189
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,060
um kind of whatever websites on the

1190
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,700
internet so and private companies

1191
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,560
adopting this as well so I think that is

1192
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,020
one area where we have seen progress in

1193
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,200
kind of organizations taking the lead

1194
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,240
and allowing security research against

1195
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,220
themselves

1196
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,780
uh yeah there was one on the back and

1197
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,400
then we'll come to

1198
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,619
wait one minute we have our room mic

1199
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,339
working

1200
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,380
all right thank you yeah the the first

1201
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,700
thing I was going to say is that it was

1202
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,920
really hard for us to hear what the what

1203
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,020
the question was and because the first

1204
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,180
question was so long it was there was a

1205
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,980
lot of nuance that was missed and I'm

1206
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,900
assuming that the camera like in the

1207
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,819
recording also might have missed that so

1208
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,500
that was that was the point that I

1209
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,240
appreciate you made

1210
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,359
um the second thing is that um it seems

1211
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,220
like the in the federal system you were

1212
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,500
talking all about the the federal the

1213
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,020
federal laws is not the state was and

1214
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,280
you're getting into it a little bit

1215
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,740
right now but the part of the design of

1216
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,660
the system seems to be allowing

1217
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,980
different states to try different things

1218
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,839
and then the federal government can kind

1219
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,060
of see which works best and then apply

1220
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,220
that to you know kind of like California

1221
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,140
leading the way on privacy things like

1222
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,819
that

1223
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,800
it's important this is actually an area

1224
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,079
where things actually work a little bit

1225
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,180
on its head for this reason

1226
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,480
so what's developed over time is that

1227
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,339
the federal government is

1228
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,560
presumed to be the one that is most

1229
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,380
likely to actually pursue what would be

1230
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,140
a you know cyber crime because often

1231
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,280
they have an international component

1232
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,619
these days almost invariably and that's

1233
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,359
something that basically states are not

1234
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,859
well positioned to

1235
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,980
to address let alone even if it's if

1236
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,599
it's domestically

1237
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,520
one that you know reaches across state

1238
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,400
lines and so it's sort of a this

1239
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,440
particular type of crime you know an

1240
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,079
intrusion or A disruption

1241
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,339
um is sort of

1242
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:29,520
tailor-made for federal government

1243
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,520
you know intervention

1244
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,440
um and just to just to quickly sort of

1245
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,240
do a quick paraphrase on the first

1246
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,660
question it was basically the the doj

1247
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,819
exemption looks at

1248
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,980
um the the sort of activities it draws a

1249
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,599
a box around say like you know if you're

1250
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,700
a good faith researcher doing these

1251
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,319
kinds of things and the question was

1252
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,540
isn't it better to look at intent rather

1253
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,220
than specific set of activities because

1254
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,040
bad guys could do those same activities

1255
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,319
um so that was that question uh okay so

1256
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,180
then you had a question at the front

1257
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,819
all right uh first off thanks for being

1258
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:06,540
here

1259
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,040
um so that the

1260
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,560
it's an idea and it's a kind of question

1261
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,599
at the same time so there's a lot of

1262
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,020
regulations out there and laws where you

1263
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,400
have to get a license to do something

1264
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,500
like on Federal Land you have to get a

1265
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,200
license to hunt can we not just have the

1266
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,440
good guys go get a license to do the

1267
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,960
good stuff and then if the bad people

1268
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,640
don't have a license you know let's put

1269
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,240
that to a vote I'm just curious so I so

1270
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,520
I I testified on this topic

1271
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,440
um I just switched Congress in 2015 on

1272
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,900
this topic and you know one of the

1273
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,220
sentences said the same thing he said

1274
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,520
we'll we'll just we'll just license

1275
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,099
researchers the problem is a lot of

1276
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,859
um discoveries are accidental incidental

1277
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:51,900
so what do you do about that you know

1278
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,980
what do you do about the five-year-old

1279
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,079
who figured out a way of hacking his

1280
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:00,020
dad's Xbox because he wanted to play

1281
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,680
um and like it's unlikely that

1282
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,760
Microsoft's gonna prosecute a

1283
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,440
five-year-old instead they actually gave

1284
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,440
him a lifetime supply of Xboxes

1285
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,599
um but like the the point remains like

1286
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,359
you we see a huge amount of incidental

1287
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:15,599
accidental Discovery and so we we want

1288
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,880
to make sure that that is also

1289
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,700
protected I think the key here is to

1290
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,380
focus Less on the concept of a

1291
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,359
researcher and more on the concept of

1292
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,880
research as an outcome

1293
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,740
that would be my that would be my take

1294
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,660
on it I mean and it's it's a good

1295
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,859
question because the flip side of that

1296
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,960
is there's been questions about like

1297
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,579
well if I'm a security researcher

1298
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,740
shouldn't I be exempt and it's sort of

1299
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,079
on its head where we say like it's not a

1300
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,540
status right you you can't say because

1301
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,339
I'm a security researcher I can do

1302
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,720
things that will be destructive or

1303
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,040
invade people's privacy right and so it

1304
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,960
as you said I think it is really looking

1305
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,240
at what is the conduct rather than sort

1306
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,920
of the status yeah I'm aware of a case

1307
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,660
at the moment where

1308
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,119
the public domain information on this is

1309
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:02,400
that poor researcher is being victimized

1310
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,460
by a nasty company

1311
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,020
truth of the matter is the researcher

1312
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,400
has taken a copy of all the data and is

1313
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,619
holding it Ransom effectively

1314
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,059
um that's not okay

1315
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,220
you you doing research for the greater

1316
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,720
good doesn't give you a get out jail

1317
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,880
free card it doesn't make it okay to do

1318
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,680
things like that Leonard mentioned the

1319
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,260
weave case earlier they took 200 000

1320
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,819
records and they sold them to Gorka

1321
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:25,559
that's not research

1322
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,300
you know you can't just say I'm a

1323
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,740
researcher therefore it's okay that I do

1324
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,300
these crazy things

1325
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,760
um in my view

1326
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,380
my non-government view

1327
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,720
um okay so sorry yeah go ahead

1328
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,760
uh good afternoon

1329
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,819
so uh several uh Attorneys General of

1330
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,220
recent uh memory um Jeff sessions and

1331
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,540
Bill Barr included but even going back

1332
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,339
to Eric Holder with respect to the San

1333
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,619
Bernardino shooting and the capturing of

1334
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,839
the iPhone have made comments regarding

1335
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,240
uh end-to-end encryption and how it

1336
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,880
pertains to lawful interception and

1337
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,400
basically alluding to backdoors master

1338
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,160
keys weakening of entropy however you

1339
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,460
want to phrase it I'd be curious to know

1340
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,380
um your read of the terrain as it exists

1341
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,480
today and perhaps how it might move

1342
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,180
forward given that this conversation

1343
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,420
seems to be driven very much in in the

1344
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,380
wake of catastrophe or references to any

1345
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,640
number of things that I think we all

1346
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,599
agree are reprehensible but to which

1347
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,119
I I think you get my my point sure uh

1348
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,880
and I have an easy answer for this

1349
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,760
because I'm a cog in a very big wheel uh

1350
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,760
and it's this Administration has not yet

1351
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,280
taken a position on that

1352
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,700
so I I I

1353
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,280
don't have as an Administration

1354
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,960
official

1355
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,300
a position on that yeah that's some nice

1356
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,720
dancing you just did I just work here

1357
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,460
oh

1358
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,800
um okay so I'm just we're gonna move on

1359
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,880
just because I know that people are

1360
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,220
interested in other uh policy topics and

1361
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,240
there are other things that have

1362
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,140
happened

1363
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,579
um so let's get a quick update on the

1364
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,020
iot cyber security Improvement act

1365
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,460
because I think that this crowd care

1366
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:18,059
about iot uh so the Act passed in 2020

1367
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:21,420
okay December 2020. and said hey this is

1368
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,440
going to figure out the details which

1369
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,160
they did

1370
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,780
and then what like it's a point blood

1371
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,660
from a stone you speak

1372
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,300
so and we were talking about this

1373
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,819
earlier so this is this like a lot of

1374
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,500
the things for example

1375
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,760
um in in in the executive orders has and

1376
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,079
also in the directives have come out

1377
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,760
things like performance goals for ICS

1378
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,839
systems

1379
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,160
um required nist and OMB to work on

1380
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,140
guidance uh that would be implemented

1381
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,359
and one thing to remember about the iot

1382
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,040
um cyber security Improvement Act is it

1383
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,720
was government focused right so sorry

1384
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,160
how many people are familiar with the

1385
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,740
iot cyber security Improvement Act

1386
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,859
okay so in a nutshell

1387
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:05,520
um

1388
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,760
rather than trying to move a broad

1389
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,520
piece of legislation to address all iot

1390
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,579
development uh Congress will Savvy and

1391
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,099
thought let's use the buying Authority

1392
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,440
that the US government has

1393
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,440
to create behavioral change uh in the

1394
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,180
market that will then create a long tail

1395
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,160
benefit so the iot cyber security

1396
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,520
Improvement Act is specifically aimed at

1397
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,099
Federal civilian agencies right and

1398
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,220
their purchasing of iot

1399
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,559
and so uh so I'm going to use this point

1400
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,599
though to Pivot to uh what I think is

1401
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,700
important I really want to make it

1402
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,740
because I think it's it's a sea change

1403
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,300
in something we've seen in the last two

1404
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,000
years and even from 2020 and that is you

1405
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,500
know you're absolutely right that there

1406
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,480
is an issue uh the thinking was that the

1407
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,619
government could drive the market and

1408
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:55,020
drive change uh in its purchasing power

1409
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,579
uh

1410
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,579
what we've seen over the last year

1411
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,540
is a government that has a much greater

1412
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,359
appetite for regulation of cyber

1413
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,680
security

1414
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,640
um writ large right so we've seen uh

1415
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,640
performance goals for ICS

1416
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,680
we've seen reporting requirements that

1417
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,720
have been promulgated by the SEC by the

1418
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,460
occfdic and fed

1419
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,000
um you've got cersea

1420
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,500
which is going through half mandatory

1421
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,300
reporting for critical infrastructure

1422
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,760
for a certain covered incidents

1423
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,520
um and these are things that were not

1424
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,099
happening I we actually attempted to get

1425
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,680
a data breach reporting law for about 16

1426
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,720
years and it essentially took what was a

1427
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,940
very bad year in cyber security

1428
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,319
incidents last year

1429
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:52,920
um

1430
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,319
and this is an area now and this all

1431
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,359
goes to also a place where I think you

1432
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,359
have a outside's voice where there's

1433
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,520
actually kind of bipartisan agreement

1434
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,760
right we actually there's actually a law

1435
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,980
on on data breach reporting and we've

1436
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,359
seen this in various other cyber

1437
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,200
security areas we have the cyber

1438
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,400
security information sharing act in

1439
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,460
2015. we had cisa authorizing statutes

1440
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,920
we had Authority given this is a that

1441
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,619
this area seems to be a place where uh

1442
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:21,599
regardless of what political

1443
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,400
um you know view people have or what

1444
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,000
administration there's been a remarkable

1445
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,040
consistency across the last several

1446
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,140
administrations from the Obama

1447
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,240
Administration through the Biden

1448
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,660
Administration on Cyber a critical

1449
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,119
infrastructure policy by and large

1450
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,020
um but I I'm I am suggesting that there

1451
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,480
actually is a change in that there is a

1452
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,660
greater appetite for actually regulatory

1453
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,980
Authority in this area than we've ever

1454
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,420
seen

1455
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,619
um and I'm going to give the last words

1456
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,819
Jack is there anything that you think

1457
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:55,260
we've missed that we should have covered

1458
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,180
off there's so many things we could have

1459
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,619
covered I think one area that hasn't

1460
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,119
been or has been mentioned in passing

1461
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:01,920
but is uh President Biden's executive

1462
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,900
order on cyber security which I think

1463
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,040
did

1464
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,900
um both through some of the kind of

1465
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,400
leveraging purchasing power of the

1466
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,839
government or just kind of government

1467
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,520
security itself and security of

1468
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,220
contractors has also represented kind of

1469
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,599
a major

1470
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,640
um shift in how the government treats

1471
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,200
cyber security includes a lot of stuff

1472
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,819
that this community has been working on

1473
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,980
software bills of material uh

1474
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,440
vulnerability disclosure policies

1475
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,420
um that we previously hadn't really seen

1476
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,660
coming at this level of policy making so

1477
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,220
I would encourage people to check that

1478
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,119
out there's a bunch of associated

1479
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,380
guidance that's come out related to that

1480
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,720
there's going to be regulations

1481
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,339
um say related to software bills with

1482
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,619
material that are kind of in the work

1483
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,000
still

1484
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,099
um but um for instance there's things

1485
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,079
like a zero trust strategy for the

1486
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,540
federal government I would give data

1487
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,180
read you might be surprised that the it

1488
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,099
includes a lot of things that probably

1489
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,720
many of us would agree on that we've

1490
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,760
never seen government talk about say

1491
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,260
fishing resistant multi-factor

1492
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,420
authentication the idea that we actually

1493
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,700
shouldn't require people to reset their

1494
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,280
password every six months or something

1495
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,380
um so some of these kind of Common Sense

1496
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,720
on technical policies finally bubbling

1497
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,319

1499
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,740
up I'm just

1500
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,440
the not American in the room a lot of

1501
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,700
these topics are also being looked out

1502
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,960
by other governments around the world

1503
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,880
and a lot of the things that we talked

1504
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,920
about around how you can get involved in

1505
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,599
influence are also true for other

1506
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,880
governments so if you are like me not

1507

1508
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,180
still relevant

1510
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,240
happening in other countries and Cavalry

1511
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,160

1512
