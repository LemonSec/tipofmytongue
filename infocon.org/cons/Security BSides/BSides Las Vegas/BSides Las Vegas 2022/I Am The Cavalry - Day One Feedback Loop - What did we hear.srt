1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
we can use this time however we like the

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,920
original intent was

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,120
um

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,039
we had a long day of telling you how

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,080
stuff is on fire

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,880
how much has changed over the last two

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,280
years imposed an open-ended question of

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,340
how should the mission evolve

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,380
now that stuff is on fire

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,240
so we started by giving a high level

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,640
overview of what things looked like nine

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,199
years ago through now when we started

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,180
this crazy Journey

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,519
then we did a deep dive on the impact of

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,199
Health Care and vaccine Supply chains

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
and how this became quite urgent and

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,200
really

18
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,380
put a bright Spotlight on that most of

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,879
these victims in critical infrastructure

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,920
are cyber poor

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,559
and we can't just give platitudes to

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,600
and then we went through a tour de force

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,620
of how many things in critical

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,239
infrastructure are on fire the water we

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,980
drink the food we put on our table oil

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,320
and gas pipelines schools municipalities

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
And Timely access to Patient Care so we

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,980
are messing with Maslow's hierarchy of

29
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,300
needs

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,899
and uh then gave a policy update on some

31
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,820
of the things changing pretty much a

32
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,979
heavy focus on the decriminalization

33
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,260
research which is at Great risk we were

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,700
in The Heading the wrong direction last

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,640
when we first met here nine years ago

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,700
but now that things are on fire and the

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,380
public and public policy makers can see

38
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,340
that

39
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,659
um our original Mission was to let

40
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,460
people know things were flammable and

41
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,860
that bad things could happen were they

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,000
to catch fire

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,759
and the question I had on one extreme is

44
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,799
maybe it's mission accomplished and we

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,659
should all pack up and go home and have

46
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,880
a mission accomplished Banner probably

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,320
not

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
or

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,860
um we could maybe keep doing a job that

50
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,479
the private sector doesn't want in the

51
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,159
public sector is often ill-equipped to

52
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,880
do

53
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,140
I don't think that's a great

54
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,659
responsibility either

55
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,700
um so we don't have an answer to our own

56
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,439
question but part of it is how should

57
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,960
our mission evolve and change so today

58
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,420
was mostly stoking

59
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,460
things that maybe you heard about from a

60
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,380
distance maybe you

61
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,979
um

62
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,780
new one or two of the stories but not

63
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,979
all of them but now that you've been

64
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,860
confronted all day this is our feedback

65
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,500
session before tomorrow uh where you can

66
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,479
ask things you didn't want to ask maybe

67
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,300
in the larger group

68
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,120
um and or start brainstorming because

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,440
tomorrow we're going to try to shift

70
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
into not the answer to the question but

71
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,459
pieces of the answer to the question

72
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,560
uh and as a preview a reminder of what

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,819
tomorrow's agenda is we're going to have

74
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,099
Lily hey Newman from wired uh and two

75
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,599
other journalists talking about how

76
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
media coverage is changing out of

77
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,459
necessity and how we make sure

78
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,900
um someone's focus on the public good

79
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,099
and Public Safety instead of just

80
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,099
selling products or fear-mongering

81
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,860
uh followed by a deep dive into s-bomb

82
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,060
which is one of the biggest victories I

83
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,140
think we've had come out of here for

84
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,000
software trust and transparency in the

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
executive order that was just mentioned

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,840
but it's not merely about s-bomb it's

87
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,459
that part of the s-bomb community

88
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,019
decided that if something's missing from

89
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,580
the private sector Market that we build

90
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,879
free open source projects and tools to

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,640
help people be safer so maybe for these

92
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,500
Target rich side Rapport we're looking

93
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
at pulling in more developers or more

94
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,540
product designers or people that can

95
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,180
nominate use cases that could help these

96
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,500
Target Rich cyberpore that are

97
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,680
underserved and under increasing attack

98
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,940
um so tomorrow's kind of a dual thing

99
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,440
for s-bomb it's going to be showing you

100
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,080
what they did to make this uh manifest

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,220
sooner

102
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,200
but also hopefully Inspire maybe there's

103
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,459
a solution for wastewater treatment

104
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,200
maybe there's a different set of

105
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
solutions for uh under invested health

106
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,299
care or for the food supply maybe

107
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,159
somebody can say I'm I'm not happy that

108
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,260
there's no food supply ISAC we should

109
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,879
start one

110
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,400
um or we should start some communities

111
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
of Interest or special interest groups

112
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,599
so tomorrow's stimulating some ideation

113
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,040
of things that Cavalry hasn't tried and

114
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,900
then we're going to Pivot into

115
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,540
how to make uh OT and ICS things

116
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,220
relevant to Business Leaders as opposed

117
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,439
to technical people and one of the ones

118
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,879
I'm really looking forward to is we have

119
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,280
Ray Davidson from Michigan who has a

120
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,780
pilot in the state of Michigan for

121
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,000
hackers collaborating with their state

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
and we have the Cyber peace Institute

123
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
looking at how they've studied many

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,640
experiments like the Michigan experiment

125
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,920
across the US and across the planet to

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
see which things are working and there's

127
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,500
other initiatives like the Cyber threat

128
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,080
intelligence league so that's I lovingly

129
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,540
call that the act locally act globally

130
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,459
session because I think we're going to

131
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,459
have to scale up and down and sideways

132
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,380
um and Federate this model so it's a

133
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,120
little less dependent on

134
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
um

135
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,600
10 Central voices and and more on the

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,360
2000 plus that are growing in our

137
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,100
assistance and I think it's going to be

138
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,380
pulling in new types of teammates

139
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,880
and then we want to have a brainstorming

140
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,759
session for like a good two hours to see

141
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,680
what we might want to try because we may

142
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
have some big decisions to make

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,740
including hiring a professional staff

144
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,840
which we've never taken a penny so that

145
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,699
would be a scary move for us

146
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,340
or um merging with some other existing

147
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,860
initiatives or

148
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,460
um

149
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,020
there's a lot of options at the table

150
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,460
but I want maybe the best option will

151
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,919
come from you so right now is not so

152
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,360
much to design them all

153
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,060
but to hear uh Audi and some of the

154
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,139
others know that I have a thing that

155
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,400
every time I give a talk I don't want to

156
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,479
just hear hey that was a good talk I

157
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,860
want to ask three basic questions what

158
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,600
was the strongest thing the weakest

159
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,699
thing and the key takeaway

160
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,380
um so similarly whether it's that's too

161
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,000
structured or whatnot like what

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
surprised you today and I'm gonna stop

163
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,960
flapping my gums here but I want to hear

164
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,860
from you

165
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,199
what was the most surprising part or I

166
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,699
think I understood why you talked about

167
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,560
water but I don't you never connected

168
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,240
the pieces so maybe we missed the mark

169
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,919
on our intended message

170
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,720
but I really want to make sure that uh

171
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,000
people understand that we

172
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,039
we're starting to see a lot more harm

173
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,600
manifest on the things we've been

174
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
warning about

175
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,419
there's very few people willing and able

176
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,699
to do anything about that and For Better

177
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,639
or For Worse this community besides and

178
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,580
on slack and on the two intertubes has

179
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,440
been the voice of reason catalyzing

180
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,240
safer outcomes sooner working with great

181
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,300
teammates like Leonard and uh others in

182
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,800
the executive branch and internationally

183
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,380
and whatnot so I don't think the work is

184
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,580
done but I am

185
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,440
I carry a humility of not knowing what

186
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,139
to do next and would like to hear from

187
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,880
each of you what resonated the most the

188
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,280
least and as we head into tomorrow it

189
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,080
may help us emphasize or punctuate and

190
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,460
refine the message

191
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,960
so

192
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,180
hey Jen we have a first question yeah

193
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,199
there's a mic being passed around

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,000
strongest thing weakest thing you take

195
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,900
away missing piece

196
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,160
uh

197
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,740
um I am not an unbiased third party but

198
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,139
I will tell you

199
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,080
what was stunning to me and here I'm

200
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,539
staring very hard

201
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,699
and a representative of the Department

202
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,460
of Justice

203
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,720
uh

204
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,440
Market concentration

205
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,340
I would suggest

206
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,180
leads to the rich get richer and the

207
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,979
poor get nothing

208
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,740
as a general matter

209
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,340
when two big forces joined together they

210
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,979
write fancy words to the Department of

211
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,160
Justice that says

212
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,780
don't worry

213
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,780
we are definitely going to

214
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,840
we will help pricing for consumers

215
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,900
there'll be no harm to Consumers those

216
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,780
are the fancy words that are written

217
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,900
as a matter of practice though I would

218
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,080
suggest that in general what we see

219
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,060
is we see

220
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,479
the top one percenters

221
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,440
make a bucket of money

222
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,660
the little people

223
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,539
generally get a kick in the teeth but

224
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,000
fundamentally

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,780
the risk is concentrated into

226
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,360
fewer and fewer larger and larger

227
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
players

228
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,979
that lead to

229
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,660
uh

230
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,460
uh a risk reward that ends up harming

231
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,060
consumers

232
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,740
um

233
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,000
rather than turning this into an

234
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,160
accidental q a for a gutty

235
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,479
um

236
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,520
can we do like a speed round of like

237
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,199
feedback and once I hear some themes

238
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,120
I'll I'll baby pose some questions to

239
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,879
all of us yeah

240
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,020
speed round

241
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,240
speed round

242
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,759
um first just submit general education

243
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,919
like something we could probably talk

244
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,240
about later is you know are you

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,458
organized are you an actual

246
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,260
non-profit or whatever your business

247
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,140
organization is second

248
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,799
um the thing that I see is is somewhat

249
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,440
similar to what you're saying David but

250
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260
I think the opportunity exists in the

251
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,959
underuserved communities for an

252
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
organization like this to do the

253
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,560
greatest good

254
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,860
um in fact you know cities and and

255
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,839
things like Jackson Mississippi that's

256
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,820
that's going through a terrible Water

257
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,440
Crisis

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,920
because they've been completely defunded

259
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,519
um

260
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,100
through an overall fault of their own

261
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,279
but need all that support so that's

262
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
that's what kind of my personal mission

263
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,140
is you know the the big cities don't

264
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,779
need the help it's a little it's a

265
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,940
little guys that need to help

266
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,180
okay I'm hearing some uh recognition of

267
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,920
one of our themes of the cyberpore the

268
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,860
have-nots thank you

269
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,600
um so I attend these conference

270
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,640
as someone who's married to a technical

271
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,540
person

272
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,940
I went to the first Defcon for my first

273
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,980
Defcon was four

274
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,660
um I've been

275
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm a I'm more aligned with in the last

276
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,160
seven years with what's going on

277
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,380
politically in my local community

278
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,380
and the one question that I always ask

279
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,620
in any conference in any

280
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,080
taught is who isn't in this room

281
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,360
and we still see a bunch of older white

282
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,240
men maybe some younger white men and a

283
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
few women

284
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
I saw like I counted today like four

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,040
black people

286
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,959
um I'm Native American I don't present

287
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,120
brown but I'm always looking

288
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,220
for the people that aren't here from

289
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,899
these underrepresented communities

290
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,279
because I can tell you they don't even

291
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,140
know what the hell is going on

292
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,019
uh they don't even feel like they have

293
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,300
any access if they own a computer

294
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,160
they're like afraid to use it because

295
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,200
they don't want to break it

296
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,680
so um as a speech and debate coach I

297
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
mean a former DOD employee but now a

298
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,180
speech and debate coach

299
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,060
um I am looking at ways to reach out to

300
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,600
our community Through the youth I have

301
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
so many parents that come to me when

302
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,100
they're kid they see finally their child

303
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
give a speech or they go to a tournament

304
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,640
and they're just like overwhelmed and

305
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,260
they're like I wish I could do that and

306
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,820
I could literally tell them give me two

307
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,459
hours and I don't care if English is

308
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,279
your first language so I see this access

309
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,000
thing going on with there are a lot of

310
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,680
problems out there there are a lot of

311
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,959
Creative Solutions that nobody ever

312
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,779
thought about because they haven't hung

313
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,519
out with someone in the from Jackson

314
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,740
Mississippi that is trying to work on

315
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,720
their Water Crisis they haven't worked

316
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,180
out on they haven't actually like been

317
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,860
on the reservations where people are

318
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,140
likely to have electricity I can tell

319
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,120
you that Native American access to

320
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,820
Internet is very low and I'm just

321
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,440
assuming that a lot of poor rural

322
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,880
communities it is so I've been working

323
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,820
with my state and the FEDS trying to

324
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,839
make

325
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
um get the idea out there that internet

326
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,459
should be a public utility for one thing

327
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,980
and therefore something that is funded

328
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,260
by the government and accessible to all

329
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,720
Americans the way that we started the um

330
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,540
electric co-ops I believe in the 30s to

331
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,279
get electricity to the rural communities

332
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,740
so that's where I'm going with this is

333
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,139
people need to know that this is even a

334
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:55,920
thing

335
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
and and it's the Outreach and I'm really

336
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
excited about hearing about the group in

337
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
Michigan I am because that's that's the

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,820
kind of thing that I'm trying to push

339
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,519
and then when they were talking today I

340
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,320
thought about 10 different ways you

341
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,420
could get in touch with your Congress

342
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,540
people and be effective so just saying

343
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,120
that I think that um that you've all

344
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,180
been focused on what's good and bad with

345
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,160
the internet and I think that it needs

346
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,600
to be accessible to a lot more people

347
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
and I agree that these very very large

348
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,360
companies a reminiscent reminiscent of

349
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,519
Ma Bell of the 70s when they broke up

350
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,860
the phone companies right

351
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,540
um we're just back where we've always we

352
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,420
always go we always like get the very

353
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,880
very rich holding on to all of the stuff

354
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,839
and

355
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,880
I would like to see the communities

356
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,800
taking some of the power back okay

357
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,160
is this oh go ahead so hey so I've I've

358
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,920
got some uh perspective as well

359
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,180
um

360
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,279
for a long time I've said that every

361
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
company is a tech company it's just most

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
of them don't know it

363
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
um from the conversation like today I

364
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,100
think that every

365
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,560
um every division of the government is a

366
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,440
tech division they just don't know it so

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,860
the I firmly believe that iot is an

368
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,800
environmental issue that we actually the

369
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,040
EPA should be regulating iot because the

370
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,420
two people that are involved the

371
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,000
purchaser and the manufacturer have no

372
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,639
incentive to protect the internet

373
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,000
like the it's cheaper to buy to buy a

374
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,959
cheap video camera or or VCR than it is

375
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,360
to buy one that's secure and the people

376
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,820
making it are buying a budget like

377
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,860
usually third party putting in things

378
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,560
with root access and back doors not even

379
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,180
caring because they're just selling it

380
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
for the most profit so like so this is

381
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,899
literally like the Mariah Bots like

382
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,839
Mariah botnet is an example of what

383
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,120
comes when you pollute the internet

384
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,820
but this is just one example right like

385
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,760
we've any other like the Federal Trade

386
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,100
Commission like any of those those all

387
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,500
need to be tech savvy Because the

388
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,600
Internet is creating the new framework

389
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
for how we Define the world

390
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,699
and if we allow these things to be built

391
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,519
wrong then we have all these riddles

392
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,800
with holes like you wouldn't let someone

393
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
build a bridge where people kept driving

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,880
off the sides

395
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,940
all right that's that's my rant but uh I

396
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,339
work in a Fortune 500 company I care

397
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,199
about these things yeah while you hand

398
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,760
the mic one of the slides I skipped this

399
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,160
morning because I took too long uh

400
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,199
I said there's no Zeitgeist like you

401
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,220
might have heard Christoph say the

402
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,600
rugged software Manifesto from like I

403
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,920
think it's 12 years ago now I don't know

404
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,860
I can't remember when we did it but

405
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,839
um I said what's the Zeitgeist or what's

406
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,279
the Hippocratic Oath for software

407
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,980
developers and I put up uh zuckerberger

408
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,959
saying move fast to break things

409
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,420
I'm like including democracy sometimes

410
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,459
and then I also showed uh Reed Hoffman

411
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,980
which is a lesser known for hackers but

412
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,220
very popular for startups which is

413
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,260
um if you're not embarrassed

414
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,000
by your your product the day you

415
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
launched you waited too long

416
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,320
and I showed the the Tacoma Narrows

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,060
Bridge and I said imagine if the people

418
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,860
who built our skyscrapers and our

419
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,600
bridges said if you're not embarrassed

420
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,820
by the riveting the day you open the

421
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,920
bridge and we are we are creating

422
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
digital infrastructure software

423
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,820
developers are and hand in glove with

424
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,079
security and risk management

425
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,480
professionals or threat modelers we do a

426
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,579
lot more to protect Enterprises and data

427
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,199
than we do to protect infrastructure in

428
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,240
humans and part of the Zeitgeist the

429
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,279
Cavalry was to shift things to what is

430
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,320
more important

431
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,759
um I'm gonna try to shorten this to

432
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,860
protect the innocent and give the mic to

433
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,680
the next person but um I gave a keynote

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
in New York City about the the kova task

435
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
force about two three weeks ago three

436
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
weeks ago now I think

437
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,560
and um the guy that came before me

438
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,779
was talking about we need less focus on

439
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,180
ransomware and this other stuff what we

440
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,399
really need to focus on is data

441
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,699
and intellectual property and and it was

442
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,279
a vendor it was a vendor

443
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,839
saying things that they can help with

444
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,180
which is not in itself wrong

445
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,399
but one of the analogies I used

446
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,660
probably better than I'm going to say it

447
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,220
right now is if you're walking down the

448
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,199
streets after a show tonight and you get

449
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,940
mugged and they say your wallet your

450
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,560
life I hope that you would prioritize

451
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,820
properly

452
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,100
but we don't and I said with HIPAA you

453
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,600
have more incentive to have a corpse of

454
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,579
their privacy intact there's no

455
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,980
incentive to protect patient care

456
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,600
there's only regulation to protect the

457
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,560
data

458
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,000
and then we give away for free anyhow

459
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,040
when we relax things for the pandemic so

460
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,259
I would like to see at least this

461
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,000
community especially because we are

462
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,139
bridge Builders and we're

463
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,180
multi-disciplinary in nature

464
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,680
to help people understand the

465
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,000
consequences and the proportional

466
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
dependence we should have

467
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,360
um so something you just said really

468
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,279
resonated with me which is If all we're

469
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,079
doing is responding to bad

470
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,139
indefensible unreliable infrastructure

471
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,180
then we're never gonna

472
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,860
change anything so that's why we really

473
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,420
push hard on software Bill and materials

474
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,420
offer transparency threat modeling

475
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,740
patchability according to disclosure

476
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,660
we're trying to build an ecosystem that

477
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,939
can anticipate and avoid failure respond

478
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,619
quickly to failure remove any sort of

479
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,539
chilling effect or disincentives there

480
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,980
it doesn't mean we've got it all figured

481
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780
out but I think focusing on a few

482
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,579
Primitives a more dependable trustworthy

483
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,740
transparent maintainable

484
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,539
digital infrastructure is a good

485
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,679
instinct

486
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,859
we just need better reach and and faster

487
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,000
um

488
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,799
all right uh I don't want to put

489
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,000
everyone in the spot there's a couple I

490
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,980
haven't spoken is anyone else have Ray

491
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,020
you came in the room or

492
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,960
um you're gonna speak tomorrow about

493
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,780
ah okay

494
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,080
the Zeitgeist for tomorrow yeah

495
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,240
all right any other feedback yeah um so

496
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,220
my name is Maurice I work for the US

497
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,380
government usaid uh the foreign

498
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,880
assistance agency and so I missed the

499
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,280
very beginning of your rant but it's

500
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,000
very relevant and uh apropos to the work

501
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,460
that we are doing as we are pushing

502
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,780
digital Technologies around the world

503
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,780
right uh what is the Do no harm or

504
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,179
relevance there in terms of ensuring

505
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,220
that what we're putting people's hands

506
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,140
is secure or as secure as possible and

507
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,960
it's something that we uh as an agency

508
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,280
as an organization are getting smart

509
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,539
about

510
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,039
um my comments on uh or thoughts on kind

511
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,600
of I'm the Cavalry and how it's evolving

512
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,299
I'm really interested to understand the

513
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,419
appetite of membership on

514
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,500
thinking uh critical infrastructure plus

515
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,360
um so looking at

516
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,000
um either spaces that are not

517
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
traditional critical infrastructure so

518
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,480
like Independent Media which is under

519
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,860
assault around the world how do we work

520
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,440
with media organizations to ensure their

521
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,100
security or at least Independence

522
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,280
um or thinking about uh Beyond just The

523
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Operators uh of CI is thinking about the

524
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,100
users and the individuals kind of

525
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,220
Downstream uh that may also be or are

526
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,340
very security poor and not in the US but

527
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,160
then around the world as well over

528
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,059
anybody else

529
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
so since since I was invited

530
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
um the a thing that I have heard that I

531
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,840
really like is the think globally act

532
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,780
locally kind of kind of aspect and I

533
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,400
think one of the common themes that that

534
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,100
I heard I have heard and I want to

535
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,820
encourage is thinking of uh this is part

536
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,400
of the Zeitgeist probably is thinking of

537
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,860
the end user or the the individual human

538
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,260
being that is affected and how they're

539
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,720
affected and trying to make the link

540
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,480
between the technology that we're that

541
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,000
we're implementing and how it's going to

542
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,620
affect people in their daily lives when

543
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,539
they don't think about it

544
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,400
because that's what we have to think

545
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
about is I I loved the Apple Macintosh

546
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
operating system when it came out back

547
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,340
in 85 well that was when I got my first

548
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,320
computer because it was the operating

549
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,179
system that just worked and it really

550
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,179
did so we have to we have to make it

551
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,500
people don't want to think about this

552
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,799
stuff so if we think about it then then

553
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,520
that's our job

554
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,659
thank you

555
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,620
anybody else

556
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,179
hey I'm John boss I don't I probably

557
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,559
haven't met most of the people in here

558
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,179
although I've I'm sure I've probably

559
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,039
seen your faces if you've seen mine even

560
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,480
though you can't tell who I am right now

561
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,059
uh I go by boss man online

562
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,400
I've been going to Defcon

563
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,720
Etc since

564
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,520
I don't know sometime back in the Lexus

565
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,000
Park maybe nine Defcon nine mostly CTF

566
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,880
School of Road stuff like that um

567
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,559
I still feel like I'm being up to speed

568
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,419
with what you're doing and what you're

569
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,580
saying I like it every time I hear you

570
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,320
talk or see you do something I think

571
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,280
it's cool and I want to get more

572
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,900
involved I just feel I don't really feel

573
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,340
like I have a lot to add other than to

574
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,140
say and like

575
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,700
the movement and I like what you're

576
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,980
doing and I'm and I'm trying to be

577
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,179
involved I feel like I'm not the right

578
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,659
com sales I don't know but uh I feel

579
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,340
like I should at least tell you who I am

580
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,520
since I'm sitting in here and why so if

581
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,659
anybody like to talk to me about

582
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,919
anything or if you have any questions

583
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,020
I'd love to answer it but for now I'm

584
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,480
really just a spectator

585
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,640
thank you and one of the things I think

586
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,100
while we've done a lot right we we have

587
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,179
not

588
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,100
been creative on creating shovel ready

589
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,960
jobs for everybody we we certainly want

590
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,820
um a meritocracy and a stone soup and

591
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,440
we've been delighted and surprised by

592
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
people that bring something we never

593
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,140
even thought of so we like to be open to

594
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,580
those possibilities

595
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,740
uh but there's a whole bunch of folks

596
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,539
that do want to help and we haven't made

597
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,760
it as easy as we could and I think that

598
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,860
may include if we did invest in some

599
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,260
back office or some professional staff I

600
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,000
believe that would improve

601
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
um Kendra for example if you were here

602
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,600
all day um from the ciscover task force

603
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
I didn't know her at all when she joined

604
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,640
the task force and uh she doesn't have a

605
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,159
hacking background and she brought such

606
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,159
organizational op Tempo and rigor and

607
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,600
tenacity for getting around

608
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
bureaucracies and almost a delight for

609
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,419
hacking bureaucracies that it's like my

610
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,159
kryptonite but like the more people we

611
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,900
find like that they're good at the

612
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,820
things we're bad at and we find that we

613
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,919
are able to do new things

614
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,200
um so that middle ground of people that

615
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,059
are Avid supporters but don't yet know

616
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,799
how to contribute

617
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,900
um I'm sure we could uh invest in that

618
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,220
and probably need to at this point to

619
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,960
get better scale

620
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,340
um anybody else I'm gonna try to

621
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,720
synthesize a few of these themes

622
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,659
um just a couple other follow-ups

623
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,620
um

624
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,799
as a licensed professional engineer

625
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,480
uh

626
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,659
um

627
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,260
certifications don't mean anything

628
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,880
they're they're something you buy and

629
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,740
you study for and you right there's no

630
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,320
there's no legal backing to them there's

631
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,100
no liability back into them

632
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,980
there's probably no propensity or even a

633
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,620
pathway to get to a licensed model

634
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,840
but I think there's a lot of good things

635
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,200
that come that can come from that

636
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,659
organizations that you know the National

637
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:15,059
Society of Professional Engineers that

638
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,600
you know we evolved from it a long time

639
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,100
ago and there was a better place for

640
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,580
that but your your discussion around the

641
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,559
Tacoma's Bridge things like that

642
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,780
you know

643
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,880
as Professional Engineers we don't play

644
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,620
in the money space we play in the

645
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,440
qualification space right so you're not

646
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,419
gonna you're not gonna lowball a number

647
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,919
to build a building is going to be

648
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,260
qualifications based so

649
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,600
there might be something there I I it's

650
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,580
it's more it's turned into such a legal

651
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
mess now

652
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,419
um I don't know but just throwing ideas

653
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,860
out there

654
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,260
um you know my my duty is to the public

655
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,240
before it is to my even to my employer

656
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,340
that's an oath that I signed right when

657
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,659
I become a licensed professional

658
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,400
engineer so

659
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,440
um isn't there a ring that some

660
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,140
Engineers wear yeah yeah

661
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,380
order the engineer yep

662
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,679
um the other part was as just as a

663
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,679
practitioner I'm I'm very concerned

664
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,779
about the number of

665
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,480
Point solutions that are out there

666
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
and the the harm that that's going to

667
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
cause

668
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,340
a lot of my clients are buying stuff

669
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,740
and

670
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,419
they've already bought stuff that'll do

671
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,179
what that does but that sales guy did a

672
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,220
better job of selling that feature than

673
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,260
the other guy did so

674
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm if there's something we can do

675
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,600
around that that that would be huge

676
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
because there's there's a lot of

677
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,320
software out there that can do a lot of

678
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,020
stuff if we know how to use it

679
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,720
and uh and deploy it properly

680
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,340
um on that last point I'm just going to

681
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,900
play jazz a little bit

682
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,460
um I wanted to synthesize many themes

683
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,260
but I I will forget this one if I don't

684
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,760
say it right now

685
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,840
um

686
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,700
this is a partial thought

687
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,740
I don't want to be crucified even on the

688
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,740
streaming for saying this but I have

689
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,960
increasingly

690
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,000
even when I started this thing even when

691
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,820
before it with the rugged idea

692
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,159
I felt that there was really two cybers

693
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,279
there was the commercial low consequence

694
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,220
private interest local harm

695
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,100
and then the public good and I I always

696
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,980
felt that what's right for the private

697
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,419
good is not what's right for the public

698
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,760
good and even if you just truncate the

699
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,200
public good for a minute

700
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,260
um a lot of my prior rate uh ranting and

701
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,720
advocacy was

702
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
you know I said like Tron I fight for

703
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,760
the user uh and I felt like most vendors

704
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,400
were trying to trick cisos and separate

705
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,020
them from their money or that we got our

706
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,640
education on the bad stuff from the

707
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,679
people selling you the anti-bad stuff so

708
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,059
we already had perverse incentives at

709
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,260
failed markets and whoever said

710
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,880
incentives today give yourself a Pat in

711
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,020
the back because this is an incentives

712
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,520
problem we have Technical Solutions for

713
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,600
a lot of these things we know how to

714
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,820
eliminate SQL injection we have we

715
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,580
haven't incentivized it right

716
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,900
that we have some hard technical

717
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,299
problems but right now the constraint is

718
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,940
usually a lack of carrots and sticks

719
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,700
in fact we Define cyberpore the long

720
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,200
definition of cyberpore when I put into

721
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
policy stuff was uh one or more of the

722
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,760
following deficiencies insufficient

723
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,740
information and awareness and or

724
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,360
insufficient carrots and sticks or

725
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,500
incentives

726
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,260
and or insufficient resources

727
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,419
and many of these owners and operators

728
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,919
are critical infrastructure that are

729
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,659
really the government's job that have

730
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:37,559
been

731
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,500
delegated to the private sector

732
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,419
um we this public prior Partnerships now

733
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,100
got in the way because we've delegated

734
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,320
the operations but the government's

735
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,299
still responsible for public good so

736
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,559
what happens when you have a fiduciary

737
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,820
local responsibility to your

738
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,200
shareholders that's in conflict with the

739
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,880
public good of access to critical

740
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,159
infrastructure so there's some

741
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,659
uncomfortable conversations we had there

742
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,700
but back to this notion of do we have a

743
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,500
tale of two cybers

744
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,539
um I'm at I'm at this point I'm at hell

745
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,220
yes and I don't know what to do about it

746
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,260
well I knew what I do know is some of

747
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,580
our best and most talented hackers

748
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,200
researchers

749
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,960
and innovators many of them didn't even

750
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,059
get a college uh High School degree let

751
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,440
alone a college degree so we are a bit

752
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,000
there's a bit of an anti-intellectual

753
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,520
anti-professionalism bent also where

754
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,960
chaotic and rebellious and that's what

755
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,820
makes it so special

756
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,840
um

757
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,020
it's part of our power and right not but

758
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,820
and

759
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
um I there have been a couple attempts

760
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,080
in the UK and in Europe to add some

761
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,940
minimum professionalization requirements

762
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,320
for certain things

763
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,720
um and it causes convulsions amongst our

764
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,039
friends but we are invited to

765
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,020
participate in these conversations and

766
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,720
an embryonic idea I've had

767
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
is perhaps we should start to opt in

768
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,120
have an opt-in consequential cyber

769
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,360
security

770
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
uh designation where if you want to pop

771
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,980
off and rant and just try to sell your

772
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,840
wares or sell your services you're

773
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,059
perfectly fine to do it do that but if

774
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,500
you want a different if someone wants to

775
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,120
differentiate themselves as focused on

776
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,919
public good or consequential cyber

777
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,260
security then by opting into that

778
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,720
verified error you know you may be more

779
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,520
called upon

780
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,220
by Congress or by committees or whatnot

781
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,860
but but and you're opting into with

782
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,000
great celebrity comes great

783
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
responsibility and perhaps we could opt

784
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,760
into a professional conduct

785
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,960
class where

786
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,480
we're not just giving a hot take

787
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,299
or giving a conference stock that you

788
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,820
know precedes a sales pitch

789
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,279
but um we can differentiate those

790
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,899
focused on the private good versus the

791
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,159
public good and sometimes it will be

792
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,760
overlap but often some of our best

793
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,140
traditional speakers and thought leaders

794
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,779
and luminaries are giving

795
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,120
increasingly horrible

796
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,600
advice about Public Safety horrible

797
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,940
and um I don't think they're bad people

798
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,260
I think we should just be able to

799
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,880
differentiate when a public policy maker

800
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,960
is saying what should I do I'm hearing

801
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,059
competing things we should have a way to

802
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,679
distinguish what's good for the company

803
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,600
versus what's good for society

804
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,460
I don't have the answer but I think

805
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,840
we're increasingly coming to the point

806
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,100
where there's not just one cyber

807
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,840
industry

808
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,860
hi Leonard hello Mr Corman um it's

809
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,200
sort of an outsider I I do want to bring

810
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,000
a question to you because I think you

811
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,279
are used to thinking about impossible

812
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,899
things and coming up with creative

813
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,460
approaches

814
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,279
one problem I see in the policy space in

815
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,020
particular is

816
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,779
um working in an area where there aren't

817
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,120
any any metrics

818
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,159
there are things that become your

819
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,340
proxies for for metrics

820
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,960
um you know whether you successfully

821
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
promulgated a policy for example

822
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,960
okay sorry but the um

823
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,460
it seems that the

824
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,100
the question really is are we safer

825
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,440
right that's the question we we need to

826
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,620
be asking at the end of the day and

827
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,140
sometimes the policy maybe would make us

828
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,399
safer

829
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,080
um sometimes it would have made us safer

830
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,299
two years ago but it the lead time to

831
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,279
get the policy actually

832
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,720
you know

833
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,580
enacted

834
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,640
made it sort of more abund by the time

835
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,380
it was and maybe it would never have

836
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,179
made us safer but

837
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,440
I've always struggled with the question

838
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,700
at the end of the day

839
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,159
are we are we safer now

840
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,980
um and that seems to be the question we

841
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,020
especially in this space need to be

842
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,320
asking and I don't know how to answer it

843
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,600
all right I I'm taking a leap here and

844
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,460
this might not be your intention

845
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,020
um

846
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,059
I'll give you the clinical protoscience

847
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,020
answer and then I'll give you the

848
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,159
personal answer

849
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,840
and I'm smiling because I feel like

850
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,340
maybe you're trolling me a little bit

851
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,960
but um I don't think you are because you

852
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
look because there's there's love here

853
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,178
um

854
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,899
we all want a science we all want

855
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,899
metrics uh and you even heard Hoff you

856
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,100
know mentioning some of that this

857
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,419
morning if you oh you came late that's

858
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,100
right so in the keynote we heard some of

859
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,080
this you know

860
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,700
we don't really have good metrics yet

861
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,440
we're not good measurement and and some

862
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,299
people like Alex Hutton and Sierra the

863
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,919
Society of information risk into people

864
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,779
and people like Bob rudis or you know

865
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,279
the data scientists that are in our

866
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,320
field there's ways to measure anything

867
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,700
but we just

868
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,640
we were rushing so fast to do number

869
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,500
based things we went from faith-based

870
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,120
security to numerology you know faith in

871
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,260
random numbers

872
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,700
and we don't have

873
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,159
good reliable consistent metrics for

874
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,120
these things and I know that's not

875
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,860
exactly what you're asking but but the

876
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,179
more people get into that they quickly

877
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,299
discovered Thomas Coons which is the

878
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,220
structure of Scientific Revolution and

879
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,840
you don't go from like chaos and Buddha

880
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,360
and Witchcraft straight to you know NASA

881
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,220
science there's things like protoscience

882
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,860
in between and we do use proxies and we

883
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,840
use indicators or confidence building

884
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,700
measures or these things strongly

885
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,399
correlate to a better outcome so for

886
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,140
example that's what I focused on with

887
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,940
our hippocratical for connected medical

888
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,380
devices and the five-star Automotive

889
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,480
Safety framework was let's not write

890
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,220
policy like the PCI standard for credit

891
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,320
cards which is stale by the time the ink

892
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,340
is dried

893
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,399
but rather focus on Evergreen

894
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,840
capabilities to handle and respond to

895
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,179
failure so a device that is not

896
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,100
patchable is less safe than when it is

897
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,919
batchable forever not not like 10 years

898
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,440
from now but forever things like a

899
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
program that has a coordinated

900
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
vulnerability disclosure a company that

901
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,000
has according disclosure program is more

902
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,559
likely to learn of faults from

903
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,779
friendlies versus adversaries so that's

904
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,640
a confidence building measure things

905
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,960
like

906
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,740
um

907
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,360
can you produce a software bill of

908
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
materials if you can't that tells us

909
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,899
something about the rigor of your design

910
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,760
or your implementation and having one

911
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
doesn't make you unhackable it just

912
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,419
means you're in an Echelon now where

913
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,679
you're more conscious and aware of

914
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,019
managing these things so we're I think

915
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:48,179
we're in that middle ground of we do not

916
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,620
have confidence that we are

917
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,200
quantitatively safer but we are trying

918
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,299
to get to that produce past the voodoo

919
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,220
and Witchcraft or high priestesses and

920
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,580
Priests and you know sacrificial goats

921
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,200
towards

922
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
um

923
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,539
confidence building measures and

924
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,640
Primitives that allow us to be in the

925
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
game now the reason I smiled on the

926
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,360
personal note is for some people that

927
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,460
have known me before the Cavalry I gave

928
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,960
a talk

929
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,000
called are we getting better

930
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,039
why we don't know and what we could do

931
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,980
about it and that was before my mom got

932
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,240
sick and

933
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,940
my life changed

934
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,620
but if you go back and watch it which it

935
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,299
was focused on almost exactly your

936
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,480
question you can see how

937
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,760
the fertile soil for the Cavalry being

938
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,559
born was already there I just needed the

939
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,820
nudge

940
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,039
um but even now a decade later

941
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
uh it's very hard to answer are we

942
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,279
getting better but the ways I tried to

943
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,899
answer that are do we have more or fewer

944
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,279
adversaries

945
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,580
do we have larger or smaller harms do we

946
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,899
have

947
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:52,559
um

948
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
you know better or worse recovery times

949
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,340
you know so there are some ways you

950
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,320
could quantify and measure overall

951
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,179
impact performance and consequence

952
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,940
analysis even if you can't do the causal

953
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,580
linkages between this security purchase

954
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,980
leads to these better outcomes my

955
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,359
general belief is we are incredibly

956
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,440
prone

957
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,679
we've been in uh prey and we survived at

958
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,480
the appetite and activity of the

959
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,219
Predator's discretion and that I think

960
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,560
is exactly what's happening right it's

961
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,119
not like critical infrastructure all of

962
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,699
a sudden became unsafe it's that there

963
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,980
has been more Brazen and aggressive

964
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,780
activity

965
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,820
uh with Advanced Revolution where the

966
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,440
unavailability of anything can be

967
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,480
monetized and this is where I said this

968
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,579
morning maybe too quickly I think the

969
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:38,820
key dilemma here is the adversaries have

970
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,000
found a way to monetize the Cyber poor

971
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,879
defenders in the RSA or black hat have

972
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,260
not figured out how to monetize a

973
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,520
cyberpore

974
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,339
and given incentives are purely

975
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,839
Financial right now

976
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,699
follow the money there's no money and

977
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,560
actually I've actually heard VCS Turning

978
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,720
Away innovators from this community that

979
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,859
are trying to help the cyberport

980
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,480
hospitals I said you should pick a

981
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,500
different industry there's no money in

982
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,280
it

983
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,960
and that is the correct thing to do for

984
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,060
shareholders it is not the correct thing

985
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,119
to do for society and um so we need more

986
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,220
public good cyber

987
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,380
and we're not currently differentiating

988
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,820
those speakers those thought leaders

989
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,920
those initiatives for who's focused on

990
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,000
public good versus private good

991
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,740
sometimes they're the same advice but

992
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,720
oftentimes increasingly they're not

993
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,420
so I it's not even a close answer to

994
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,520
your question but it's

995
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,260
um these are things I wrestle with

996
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,700
because we aren't gonna

997
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,040
make progress or strides unless we know

998
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,480
what we're solving for whom we're for

999
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,880
whom we're solving and and the whole

1000
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,619
Spirit of things like SOS and bad

1001
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,020
practices and the free

1002
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,180
system Services was to meet people where

1003
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,560
they are

1004
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,300
not giving platitudes

1005
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,740
and some of those things are hard right

1006
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,839
I recognize the contradiction I'm here I

1007
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:49,980
am saying let's meet people where they

1008
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,180
are where they have no resources and no

1009
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,680
staff and I'm saying by the way it's a

1010
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,300
really bad dangerous negligent practice

1011
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,760
to run unsupported software what if you

1012
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,660
don't have enough money to do anything

1013
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,880
but unsupported Exchange Server I

1014
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,680
recognize that apparent contradiction

1015
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,160
but I'm sick of watching it happen and I

1016
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,020
said let's at least stimulate and force

1017
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,300
the hard conversations

1018
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,859
um little inside baseball I guess while

1019
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,900
I'm running on that thread

1020
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,240
my key inflection point to cause bad

1021
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,040
practices there was several reasons I

1022
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,020
wanted to do it but the key moment was

1023
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,240
when the Microsoft Exchange attacks were

1024
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,700
happening everywhere Bob root is Chief

1025
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,380
data scientist at the time at rapid

1026
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,240
seven scanned the whole internet and was

1027
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,460
looking for which versions of exchange

1028
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,140
were out there so we could see

1029
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,880
you know if people were patching he

1030
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,260
wasn't looking for

1031
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,820
how bad is it out there he was just

1032
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,260
trying to see what are the patch rates

1033
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,400
by version

1034
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,700
and sisa Hill the public call saying

1035
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,500
uh with Microsoft saying here's the

1036
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,180
patches do you have any questions you

1037
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,760
know how much exploitation is there

1038
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,820
and when all this all the broadcasting

1039
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,839
was done and the question started

1040
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,920
rolling and people said well what am I

1041
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,599
going to get my patches

1042
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,859
and they said what do you mean we

1043
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:56,880
already went through that and they said

1044
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,740
well I'm running this version

1045
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,020
and Bob quickly looked in his data and

1046
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,420
the number one market share of exchange

1047
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,220
on the Internet is unsupported

1048
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,579
it's not an edge case it's everywhere

1049
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,740
and I at the time made an emotional joke

1050
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,880
and said we almost needed child

1051
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,260
protective services that if you can't

1052
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,640
take care of exchange we'll take care of

1053
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,099
it for you by you know rolling you on to

1054
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,980
you know at least Office 365 or or

1055
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,440
Google Suite or something

1056
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,480
and we went to some of the well-funded

1057
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
hospitals I'm like you seem to be among

1058
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,560
these ranks that are running wildly

1059
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
unsupported you realize that if you're

1060
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,440
compromised or exchanged the whole

1061
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,119
Hospital's gone

1062
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,680
and they said

1063
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,720
Josh it would cost like a million

1064
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,880
dollars to migrate we're never gonna do

1065
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,339
that and it was sincere and I should

1066
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,599
have empathy for their resource

1067
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,099
constraints

1068
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,619
and it's dangerous so what do you do

1069
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,400
when it's common and dangerous so

1070
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,339
this meeting people where they are thing

1071
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,280
um it's not going to be take a

1072
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,339
product designed for the fortune 50.

1073
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,079
that only the Fortune 50 can use and

1074
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,339
hope that eventually helps them down

1075
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,140
Market if you require an army of

1076
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,300
talented Engineers to operate it it's

1077
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,339
not it's not a solution set

1078
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,020
so I think the answer is going to be

1079
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,160
when you're over dependent on a

1080
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,320
Dependable things there's at least two

1081
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,980
parallel paths one is depend less upon

1082
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,720
them so wherever you can reduce your

1083
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,520
dependence and act attack surface we

1084
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,839
should

1085
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,579
and

1086
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,339
depend more uh demand more from your

1087
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,320
suppliers that these things are that are

1088
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,240
maintained and operated I mean et cetera

1089
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,700
and then in the glue in the bridge in

1090
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,160
between I'm kind of hoping tomorrow

1091
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,780
reveals is can we make some open source

1092
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,700
projects that are designed for the

1093
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,560
cyberpore for people with limited staff

1094
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
for the internet attack surface because

1095
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,140
while anybody can get hacked most of

1096
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,880
these ransoms for critical

1097
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,260
infrastructure have not been targeted

1098
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,020
they've been wholesale you know Kill

1099
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,460
Everybody

1100
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,020
Harvest later who we're going to

1101
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,760
actually spring the trap on

1102
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,440
um and if you can maybe take yourself

1103
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,300
out of that low-hanging fruit pool it

1104
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,859
might be the difference between water or

1105
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,140
no water or Healthcare or no health care

1106
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,060
for a bit and that's not the end of the

1107
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,740
journey it's the starting line but if

1108
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,240
you want to get people from here to

1109
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,500
there they cannot kind of do it like

1110
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,599
that we have to have a

1111
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,780
a crawl walk run right Jen

1112
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,020
uh it's part of Josh Corman Bingo cards

1113
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,079
um okay so that was a long

1114
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,460
improvisational stream of Consciousness

1115
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,140
trying to string together several things

1116
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,359
said here but I hope you heard that the

1117
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,300
cyberpore is where I I'm feeling more

1118
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,560
focused not just all critical

1119
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,540
infrastructure but the sad rapport

1120
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,460
uh and that they don't have the tools

1121
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,040
the education or the assistance required

1122
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,200
and perhaps we can help with that I

1123
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,820
would like sister to do that I would

1124
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,400
like HHS and EPA to do that I do not

1125
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,900
perceive them to be willing and able to

1126
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,440
do that job at the scale required yet

1127
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,619
um so I'd like to help them get there

1128
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,380
versus do it for them or watch it fall

1129
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,420
and so perhaps we can be

1130
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,680
public good augmentation

1131
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,780
with initiatives like race that you're

1132
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,520
going to hear about tomorrow

1133
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,079
all right who else we have a little more

1134
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,980
time anybody

1135
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,300
oh before you go

1136
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,400
because you might want to comment on it

1137
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,200
I didn't want to completely respond to

1138
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,880
your first thing you said but there's an

1139
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,859
interesting dichotomy when I looked

1140
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,119
across the 16 critical infrastructure

1141
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,859
sectors if you take banking out of it

1142
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,859
with banking the biggest players are the

1143
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:27,540
most important the risk Aggregates

1144
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,880
proportional to their size for the most

1145
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,780
part

1146
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,460
but for a lot of things like water it's

1147
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,380
very diffuse

1148
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,859
so what is it would you say 90 of the

1149
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,660
water in the country is done by 10

1150
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,339
percent of the municipalities

1151
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,920
and it has a long tail for the

1152
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,780
um others same thing with hospitals you

1153
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,819
have the 15 that have a good staff of 50

1154
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,079
people or more

1155
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,839
and then everybody else has zero people

1156
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,339
so um

1157
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:54,720
not every one of these critical

1158
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,819
infrastructures has cyberpore but

1159
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:59,099
there's a dichotomy with risk

1160
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,420
concentration because when you only have

1161
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,339
four meat packing facilities

1162
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:03,960
any one of them getting infected has an

1163
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,579
asymmetric impact on everybody else

1164
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:06,720
right

1165
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,020
uh the downside of all these diffuse

1166
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,400
Federated Target recycler poor is that

1167
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,599
we don't really have a strategic

1168
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,819
leverage point to make broad

1169
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,579
improvements so uh channeling my inner

1170
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,400
Dan gear uh monocultures are bad

1171
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,140
and nature loves diversity but there can

1172
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,599
be too much diversity so I don't think

1173
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,220
we're gonna have a single TurnKey answer

1174
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,920
for this but in some cases consolidation

1175
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,740
is a is a good move in other cases we've

1176
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,260
gone too far with it and my real fear

1177
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,960
for healthcare specifically is that the

1178
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,300
financial solvency of hospitals has been

1179
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,040
further challenged by not having

1180
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,319
elective surgeries and things and by

1181
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:46,020
blowing all their r d money on Traveling

1182
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,300
Nursing budgets and bonuses

1183
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,819
so if we were already trending to Too

1184
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:53,220
Much consolidation to too few

1185
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,680
it's about to get worse in the aftermath

1186
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,540
of the pandemic so we may see just

1187
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,119
economic

1188
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,800
survival the fittest kind of problems

1189
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,079
worsen the consolidation that you're

1190
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,520
referring to so I don't know that we

1191
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,140
want to do the mama Bell breakups and

1192
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,940
things like that but I think as a

1193
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,500
national resilience strategy for

1194
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,200
critical infrastructure specifically and

1195
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,359
for things that affect the public good

1196
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,300
we should have some deliberate

1197
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,819
first principles that guide what is

1198
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:22,500
healthy consolidation versus over

1199
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,540
consolidation and how to make sure that

1200
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,700
a resilient National critical function

1201
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,280
is one that is not has have excessive

1202
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,140
aggregated risk so it's I don't think

1203
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,940
it's a no aggregation I don't think it's

1204
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,339
a pure Federation

1205
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:37,680
um I think in certain areas we have too

1206
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,940
much concentration of risk food supply

1207
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,440
is one that scares me

1208
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,540
and I think in other areas we're too

1209
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,900
diffuse

1210
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,200
we had the 10-minute Warning by the way

1211
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,240
um thanks for that

1212
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,900
it's a it's a hard problem right so uh

1213
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,800
there's there there is not really a

1214
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,839
silver bullet one of the things I wonder

1215
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,060
about

1216
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,500
is

1217
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,240
so when we think about

1218
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,920
water on my water guy left

1219
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,380
[Music]

1220
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,200
um we when we're still thinking about

1221
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,079
when we think about water we think about

1222
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,300
municipalities we think about States

1223
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,280
think about ciso what I'm wondering is

1224
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,839
can we get

1225
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
more people into the room and so here

1226
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm thinking about like

1227
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,660
MSI sac

1228
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,180
and in ciso to be able to

1229
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,220
share the

1230
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,000
share the information down into Biloxi

1231
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,819
Mississippi and

1232
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:53,700
small town from underserved State X

1233
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,260
to

1234
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,920
we we got a lot of different Frameworks

1235
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
and a lot of different players in the

1236
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,400
space but how can

1237
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,940
how can we be smarter about

1238
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,760
sharing

1239
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,920
really good information

1240
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,180
with what our historically the have-nots

1241
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,780
um

1242
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm going to caveat this with I'm a bit

1243
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
jaded after my federal service but I

1244
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,119
found that the public-private

1245
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,380
partnership

1246
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,540
maybe with the best of intention

1247
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,339
places a lot of confidence that the ice

1248
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:31,260
acts and the sector according councils

1249
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,599
represent all their members

1250
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,420
but maybe by accident

1251
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,280
they tend to be very dominated by the

1252
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,780
well-funded

1253
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,240
um they have cisos they have systems who

1254
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,319
can spend

1255
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,660
an hour a week or more on these

1256
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,940
committees and phone calls

1257
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,400
um so at least for most of the ones I

1258
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,020
interacted with

1259
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,760
um they'd probably in good faith believe

1260
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,220
that they're helping the Cyber poor but

1261
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,380
I had to keep helping and reminding them

1262
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,420
that they weren't um and I and I'm not

1263
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,460
there to do it every day anymore

1264
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,359
um

1265
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,900
so I believe we're gonna have to augment

1266
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,400
the current definition and scope of the

1267
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,200
public-private partnership although you

1268
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,700
did call out one of the best ones the

1269
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,140
MSI Sac the multi-state ice Act

1270
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,420
um which is operated by the CIS the

1271
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,339
center for Internet Security

1272
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,859
um they

1273
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,900
and the election security you know wing

1274
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,460
of what happened there

1275
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,420
um

1276
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,339
out of necessity they tend to be more

1277
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:30,960
focused on what might look like

1278
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,520
cyberpore so I think they're more

1279
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,800
attuned to the mission of all the ice

1280
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,540
Acts

1281
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,560
um

1282
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,420
and as I indicated if you weren't in the

1283
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,680
room all day there is no food supply

1284
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
Isaac

1285
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,720
there's a it ISAC special interest group

1286
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,180
of a handful of players and that's it

1287
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,560
so

1288
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,220
um

1289
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,500
whereas most the ice acts meet weekly

1290
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,599
with their Federal Partners these there

1291
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,400
isn't one to meet annually

1292
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,480
so

1293
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,940
and there is as you presented in your

1294
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,520
session significant concentration of

1295
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,780
risk

1296
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,640
and if you combine concentration of risk

1297
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,260
of the entities with where they sit in

1298
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,819
the overall supply chain take the ball

1299
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,500
bearings analysis that Michelle talked

1300
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,300
about and your Consolidated risk point

1301
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,260
and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable

1302
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,760
at your turn

1303
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,700
so I'd like to Pivot off of that

1304
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,040
slightly the going back to perverse

1305
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,079
incentives

1306
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,420
um if you look at the U.N the hum the

1307
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,760
human rights committee it's like

1308
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,160
entirely made up of countries that have

1309
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,520
horrible human rights records right like

1310
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,220
like almost uniformly like if you if you

1311
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,020
stack ranked it and inverted the stack

1312
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,780
rank you it would be like The Who's Who

1313
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,339
of like all the bad company other

1314
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:48,000
countries so in the same way we we don't

1315
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,800
have the right way like the people that

1316
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,480
care the most about an issue are the

1317
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,579
ones that benefit from the issue

1318
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,040
and and most of the time that's going to

1319
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,560
be the wrong people so so we need to

1320
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,680
have like values-based positions and we

1321
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,900
need to have like was coming from those

1322
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,359
like perspectives we can't do it based

1323
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,819
on who's gonna profit because they're

1324
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:10,560
the people that do or almost always

1325
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,839
going to be the wrong ones

1326
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:14,700
um Goldman Sachs was recently in the

1327
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,440
news I believe for saying something

1328
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,660
about why are we trying to solve disease

1329
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,359
when we can just cure it kinda

1330
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,400
um you know if you heal people they

1331
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,660
don't come back

1332
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,119
so so keeping them dependent on you is

1333
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,099
the way to like keep making money and

1334
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,559
that's that's you know so it's like like

1335
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,420
why would you make the infinite like

1336
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,460
light bulb when you can keep selling

1337
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,220
people new light bulbs right so I think

1338
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,020
that the government does have some

1339
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,960
reason to step in when it comes to the

1340
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,180
greater good when there's not a

1341
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,940
financial incentive because capitalism

1342
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,500
Etc et cetera

1343
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,119
um so so that's something where we do

1344
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,920
need to think about what is what is the

1345
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,380
policy we want and how does that help

1346
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,020
guide the the checks and balances and

1347
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,260
provide the incentives so that we say we

1348
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,700
know you're gonna like

1349
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,940
make insulin for cheap and like here's

1350
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,740
how we're gonna make it worthwhile to

1351
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,180
you to do it instead of charging a

1352
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,899
thousand dollars a shot

1353
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,400
uh hand in the back fit

1354
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,619
we're in the five minute warning section

1355
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:18,660
but we can keep talking tomorrow and

1356
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,859
even at the bar tonight

1357
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,740
to answer the previous one I don't think

1358
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,540
that anybody can question whether or not

1359
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,400
our security is better

1360
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,260
because I remember back whenever we were

1361
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,280
just trying to get people to actually

1362
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,900
have a firewall

1363
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,780
and nobody even questions that now I

1364
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,059
also remember ciso's nobody even knew

1365
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,859
what the hell it was and

1366
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,540
you know now that now we're having

1367
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,040
questions as to whether or not they

1368
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,200
ought to be on the board or not you know

1369
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,240
so we're at least moving in the right

1370
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,700
direction whether or not it's enough is

1371
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,260
why you're having a hard time getting

1372
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,900
the metrics because it's not are we

1373
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,599
making progress we are it's just isn't

1374
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,460
enough and that's that's a different

1375
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,859
question so that's that's one of the

1376
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,079
things to help with that

1377
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,420
but one of the things I'm listening to

1378
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,220
everybody

1379
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,960
it's culture

1380
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,480
we all know the number one thing that is

1381
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,400
difficult as hell to get anything to

1382
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,079
change is the culture because people

1383
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,280
hate change

1384
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,020
I had an argument with a guy whenever I

1385
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,940
first got into the Navy about whether or

1386
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,619
not people like change knows also 20

1387
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:25,559
years old and wanted change so I thought

1388
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,619
change everybody wanted it no they don't

1389
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,280
and culture is what is holding us back

1390
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,460
I have dealt with a lot of HIPAA and uh

1391
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,460
the problem with the medical areas is

1392
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,160
the culture you walk in the door and the

1393
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,480
first thing they do is ask you what your

1394
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,220
social is in front of a room full of

1395
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,119
people

1396
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,960
what's your name what's your social

1397
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,079
nobody the culture there has gotten us

1398
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,900
so that we are used to thinking about

1399
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,720
I got if I want my leg my leg broke you

1400
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,059
know my broke leg fixed I got to give

1401
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:02,400
out my social security number or else I

1402
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,280
got problems and that's a culture that

1403
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,780
that's just what they think about the

1404
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,660
the military has the same issue I can't

1405
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,760
go in and get anything from the military

1406
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,099
without starting off with my last four

1407
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,339
which is the only random part of it

1408
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:19,920
and giving that the culture is is the

1409
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,819
problem

1410
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,579
and to your point whenever it comes to

1411
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,880
government being able to regulate stuff

1412
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,339
the fact is is that these the culture

1413
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:31,680
behind water

1414
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,480
it's not going to change because they

1415
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,640
literally have no incentive which is I

1416
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,260
think where you were going earlier they

1417
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,119
have no incentive to change unless

1418
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,559
somebody's going to go beat them up and

1419
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,900
give them money for it

1420
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,800
carrots and sticks or carrot shapes but

1421
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,839
you know whenever it comes down to it

1422
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,480
it's not just the money

1423
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,240
it's America we got we got money

1424
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,420
but the culture does not want us to

1425
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,260
change

1426
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,119
would you agree with that or I mean is

1427
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:01,800
that it seems like yes I think it's

1428
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,180
culture I do think it's incentives and I

1429
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,079
think that's one of the reasons we

1430
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,400
brought a lot of heart and empathy to

1431
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,079
this instead of facts and figures I mean

1432
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,900
the tax figures come as well

1433
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,480
um and maybe just to end on a

1434
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,800
it's a hard pivot from what you're

1435
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,880
saying but maybe to pull some of these

1436
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,619
things together in a positive note when

1437
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,059
I ask what what did the world look like

1438
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,140
nine years ago and what does it look

1439
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,300
like now

1440
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,579
um we were training towards increased

1441
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,619
chilling effect on good faith research

1442
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,839
we're in training towards

1443
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,300
uh increased animosity uh between

1444
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,920
government Partners in the hacking

1445
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,079
Community we were increasing our

1446
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,480
dependence on medical devices and cars

1447
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,520
that were hackable

1448
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,619
um and now you know the last nine years

1449
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:42,599
as we skim the Treetops from this

1450
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,619
morning

1451
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:44,339
um

1452
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:45,839
we have

1453
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,520
every Federal agency has has a

1454
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,960
coordinated disclosure program we have

1455
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,880
an exception the dmca for good faith

1456
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,579
research Leonard a a very bad

1457
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,140
oversimplification what he was saying is

1458
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,700
doj put out guidance to the State

1459
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,000
Attorney General saying please pass on

1460
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,920
Prosecuting good faith researchers

1461
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,760
um

1462
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,300
directionally similar to the dmca we

1463
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,400
have initiating catalyze the first ever

1464
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,920
set of safety Communications and recalls

1465
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,900
for medical devices with no Adverse

1466
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,059
Events or patients dying first so very

1467
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,300
left a boom we were called upon uh when

1468
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,980
there was Congressional actions on

1469
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,619
things like Waste Water treatment on

1470
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:25,140
things like ICS Sprints and to help

1471
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,180
design and lead the cobit response for

1472
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,000
the pandemic for hospitals so I I think

1473
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,040
our level of Engagement is higher the

1474
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,200
level of trust is higher

1475
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,119
the level of

1476
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,099
Common Sense first principles to be

1477
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,140
patchable to avoid hard-coded passwords

1478
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,000
to get things in executive orders

1479
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,559
domestically and internationally we

1480
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:44,460
didn't talk enough about International

1481
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,200
Partners but sometimes when we hit an

1482
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,819
obstacle in the U.S we go to our UK

1483
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,220
Partners or our Japanese Partners or

1484
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,220
emea Partners or and and we're kind of

1485
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,140
flanking with a conspiracy of excellence

1486
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,180
and I would not say these victories are

1487
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,220
mission accomplished because in parallel

1488
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,920
with those incredible breakthroughs

1489
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,440
we have seen unprecedented adversary

1490
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,359
activity and more Embrace and embolden

1491
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,859
so

1492
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:10,440
um I I said this in my Senate testimony

1493
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,760
along with it here

1494
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,280
um our adversaries have set the pace

1495
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,079
we gotta catch up

1496
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,599
right so yes we've done a lot of good

1497
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,220
things there's much much more to do and

1498
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,780
we need the political will and the

1499
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,280
courage to do so and that means we're

1500
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,420
gonna have to speak on a very human

1501
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,460
level a very multi-stakeholder level a

1502
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,780
very accessible level

1503
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,940
and we're gonna have to

1504
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,559
take people in uncomfortable areas

1505
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,180
because these are the moments in the

1506
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,800
Overton's window if you know that term

1507
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,660
where there is political will to do

1508
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,099
something and get outside the comfort

1509
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,380
zone and challenge their conventional

1510
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,640
preferences

1511
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,440
and sometimes it takes really bad events

1512
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,780
to catalyze really good progress and I

1513
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,040
think we're on the cusp of that in some

1514
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,160
areas but how this community that

1515
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,599
started here nine years ago with

1516
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,280
parallel companion efforts and sister

1517
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,260
efforts um

1518
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,940
you know we have a lot more to do so I'm

1519
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,680
really really tired and I think a lot of

1520
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,839
you are as well and

1521
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,880
and let's finish the job so tomorrow

1522
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,280
bring your best ideas any game and let's

1523
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
let's figure out how to take this to the

1524
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,859
next level thank you for your time today
