welcome to the technical trap uh as with

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,000
every good meeting we're going to have

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,360
an agenda

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,160
so

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
we'll go through so many directions

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
then we're going to go into

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
the meat and potatoes for this which is

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,879
we want this to be very interactive

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
so you know everyone we're gonna have a

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
session of back and forth discussion

and let's have some fun with this uh

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
we're gonna go through some survey data

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
and kind of something that inspired this

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
discussion

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,960
and we'll talk about uh the the

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
technical trap and the impact of it and

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
really the goals for today just

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
awareness around the issue and

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
discussion and some strategies to handle

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
it when you find yourself stuck in it

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640

why this talk

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,560
it spawned uh back probably in the may

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
time period where i was actually working

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
with one of my peers and we were

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
discussing uh reviews

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
and she was uh having a difficult moment

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
where

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
someone in another org had gone up and

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
said well it's great but your team's not

77
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
technical

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,599
and

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,280
this has been the fourth or fifth time

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
they continue to hear that statement and

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,959
we started to just have the discussion

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,040
like what the hell do we mean

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
when we say technical so

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,560
i did what everyone does on the internet

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
i posted it on linkedin

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
and we did a survey so we're going to go

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
and talk through some of that

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
before we get through all the survey

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
data and that goodness we want to know

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,319
what you all think

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
so

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
a little fun time

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
when someone is described as technical

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
in cyber security

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
what skill

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
or skills

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
does that individual have

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
there's a couple of rules for this time

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
period because we only have you know 45

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
minutes

101
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
these are thoughts not a debate

102
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,360
and

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,159
keep your mat your answer to max of five

104
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
words so you know it's not

105
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,319
the you know the story of crimea

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,599
yep

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
please

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
i think that they have knowledge within

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,599
one of the domain spaces of the system

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,120
what's that

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
when you say what's technical security i

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
think they have knowledge within one of

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,239
the domain spaces of this

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
cassp

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
okay domain knowledge the issp

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
hands-on keyboard

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
understanding of the technical stuff

118
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,600
knowledge is thought

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,560
understanding of the technology

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,560
the what's that technology stuff okay

121
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
they can script they can patch system

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,199
they can build systems they understand

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
network concepts

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,759
so scripts they can patch and what was

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,080
the last one

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
network knowledge okay

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
curiosity and willingness to learn

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,560
so what was that

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
curiosity curiosity and willingness to

130
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160

and i can't spell

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
what else do you say the word technical

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
in cyber security we've so far

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,680
oh

137
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,560
subject matter expert in a platform

138
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
subject matter expert in a platform

139
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,080
okay

140
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
anything else any other skill sets

an enter at least an intermediate level

147
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,960
some

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560

152
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
the ability to be right

153
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,360
okay

154
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
i guess like in the weeds practical

155
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
experience

156
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639

yeah

160
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
i'd say a troubleshooter

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,160
a troubleshooter

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
read and understand code

163
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
read and understand code

164
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,120
like enigma

165
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
okay so like a packet level

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
understanding yeah

167
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
anything else

168
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
your your technical and cyber security

169
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,039
what skill do you have

170
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
being able to be able to explain the uh

171
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,280
the mechanism through which the security

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,520
control functions

173
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
being able to explain involved con

174
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
complex

175
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
explain how a security control functions

176
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
and operates i think it's the fans let

177
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
me come this way

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,319
sorry

179
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,840
what was it being able to explain how a

180
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
security control operates uh security

181
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,199
controls

182
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
aha being able to explain how security

183
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
control operates

184
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
being able to talk to

185
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,560
engineers did he get it

186
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,479
all right and i heard um talk to

187
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
engineers

188
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,599
can conduct a vulnerability assessment

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,559
and or the pin test and understand the

190
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
results

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
can conduct a vulnerability assessment

192
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,040
can conduct i'm going to separate those

193
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,599
uh but

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
conducts

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
vmss

196
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,399
conducts pen tests

197
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
all right so

198
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
this is a really uh really good uh

199
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
selection from our from everyone here

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
i want to ask though

201
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
are there any up here that you look at

202
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
and uh

203
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
you would put over in the

204
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
and i like to call it the vi or nano

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,399
level fight

206
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,519
like you disagree

207
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,680
i would say read and understand code

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,480
would be that kind of a fight because

209
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
you can be very technical at like packet

210
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
level understanding you can be very good

211
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,200
at that but not know how to write code

212
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
or vice versa

213
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
so are you saying that

214
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,560
either of those skills are not

215
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
necessarily required

216
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,399
but they would both be considered

217
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,160
technical

218
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,399
okay

219
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
is there

220
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
anything else up here though

221
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
you know you look at you're like well

222
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
that's not a technical skill

223
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
uh not to muddy it more but like maybe

224
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
like the ability to use like

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
reversing yeah so yeah

226
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
the ability to use

227
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
i uh either pro or

228
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
reversing

229
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
reversing tools

230
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,119
so

231
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
thanks for being part of this exercise

232
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
and actually

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
participating because

234
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
this is the type of discussion that you

235
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,160
know we've been having leading with our

236
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
teams as well around

237
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
you know what does it mean

238
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
when somebody comes to you and says

239
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
you're not technical enough

240
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,640
you know are you have are you advanced

241
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
you're technical

242
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
all of these skills like you you look

243
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
across and i loved um i believe you

244
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
mentioned the domains um sorry who

245
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
mentioned sorry you mentioned the

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,519
domains

247
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,519
always go across to the multiple csv

248
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
domains as well as skills outside of

249
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
cssp

250
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
um

251
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
so

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
when we think about this from

253
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,040
you know the the next question that we

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,640
asked we asked this question to start of

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
what does it mean to be technical in

256
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,519
cyber security

257
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,440
the next question we asked was

258
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
sorry

259
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,160
of these

260
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,279
which of these are engineering skills

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
which these are not engineering skills

262
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
let's start with that we'll go to the

263
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,279
negative

264
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
security controls and operations

265
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
because

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
my assistant team does not want to do

267
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
controls

268
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,399
pen tests for an engineering team

269
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
conducting them okay

270
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,439
i don't know

271
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
does anyone have an engineering team

272
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
that conducts pen tests

273
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,120
yeah

274
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
this is why this topic is so much fun

275
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
because

276
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
we have what you know 30 people in this

277
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
room and we have 30 different

278
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
perspectives on a definition of a term

279
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
that we're holding people accountable to

280
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,519
oh

281
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
that's a very good point

282
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
yeah sorry the question was what do we

283
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
mean when we say engineering team

284
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
because there are there's physical

285
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
engineering there is our software

286
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,680
engineer there's

287
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,959
all the domains of engineering

288
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
so

289
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,319
let me get back into the slide there

290
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,839
so i want to turn back over to lee to

291
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
talk about the the data that we pulled

292
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
out

293
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,160
all right cool so we actually

294
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,399
did a survey um

295
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
and one of the questions we actually

296
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,880
asked was tell us what you think you

297
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
know technical means tell us what you

298
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
think engineer means and then just tell

299
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
us anything else you think we should be

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
aware of like just give us your open

301
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,519
feedback

302
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
um

303
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
which is in a different order let's

304
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,040
i'll get there eventually

305
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
i'll go a different order so here's the

306
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
open feedback we got

307
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
um

308
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
i'm not going to read all of them but

309
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
we highlighted the parts that we thought

310
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
were relevant right

311
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,320
so

312
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
greater than zero knowledge writing

313
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
about code

314
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,839
limited to no coding experience

315
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
soft slash people skills personally i

316
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,399
prefer leadership skills but you know

317
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,519
that's me

318
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,519
uh gatekeeping

319
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
gatekeeping

320
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
all right so let's go back a little bit

321
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,639
so it's an open survey anybody on the

322
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,639
internet could answer it it's probably

323
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
people we know let's i mean there's a

324
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,240
little bit of that going on

325
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,279
um

326
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,040
so we did ask people for demographic

327
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,320
information i always think that's

328
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,279
helpful

329
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,800
you know just to set the tone like who's

330
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
answering these questions

331
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
we mostly got a bunch of men answering

332
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
these questions like we were joking like

333
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,240
what does that say about our

334
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,839
all the people we know

335
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,600
um and we actually got a ton of people

336
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,680
with a lot of experience

337
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,839
which i

338
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,480
actually i read all the data lying by

339
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
painstaking line

340
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,199
and

341
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
you could really see some interesting

342
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,560
changes that we're not going to go into

343
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
for this talk but as you went through

344
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,079
years of experience

345
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,519
that i thought was really really

346
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,920
fascinating

347
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
so

348
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
everybody just gave us open-end uh

349
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
comments like way more than five works

350
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
in case you're wondering and so i tried

351
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,760
to group things because i wanted to

352
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
create like those word clouds so for

353
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
example if somebody said you need to be

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
a pen tester you need to know cloud

355
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,959
security

356
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,760
you

357
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
need to be an infrastructure person

358
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,560
um anything in like the

359
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
assists domains i put together all as

360
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,560
security domain

361
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
um just because that was easier because

362
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
i mean otherwise you just get like

363
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,000
the world's largest word cloud that

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
would mean nothing to anyone

365
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
um so you saw a lot of people say

366
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,519
security domain

367
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,920
a lot of people actually said systems so

368
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,160
you you both the systems concept and

369
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
systems design i broke them apart

370
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
please don't hate me

371
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
um

372
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
some people didn't actually go into

373
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
security domains you just say security

374
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,959
all up and i didn't really know what to

375
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,040
do with that so i left it alone

376
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
um

377
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,079
i mean coding's up there

378
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
like it's pretty big right

379
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,040
and somewhere there's scripting

380
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
not as big much smaller

381
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,639
but i thought it was really interesting

382
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,079
where the number of people who said you

383
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,880
have to understand you have to have

384
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,399
knowledge

385
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
um sometimes people might use the word

386
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,120
expertise even right so it's like you

387
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
have to understand

388
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,079
okay cool so what did they say for

389
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,359
engineer then

390
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
i mean it's similar but it's different

391
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,839
right like

392
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,839
coding is probably the biggest word out

393
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,040
there

394
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
which i thought was fascinating and then

395
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,160
build which makes sense right like we

396
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
all build

397
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,199
something

398
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,320
um

399
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,560
again you got security domain you got

400
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,199
systems i think someone said hands-on at

401
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,680
one point that got up there i saw a lot

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
of people call out

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
tools and tooling

404
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,360
um

405
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,920
and controls and so like all the words

406
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,519
we use right

407
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
so we already hit the comments of no but

408
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
i want to bring it back up again right

409
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
so

410
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,839
i think the bottom two are the most

411
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,000
telling for me right like i love the

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
not technical is almost always a

413
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
gatekeeping way of saying

414
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,439
not technical in the same way

415
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
i think that was brilliant it's such an

416
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,640
easy way to capture kind of what we're

417
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,119
discussing

418
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
okay

419
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,880
so we've talked about a bunch of words

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
you all participated you're all awesome

421
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
um so what's the solution to the

422
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,679
confusion well i mean we're nerds so we

423
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
like went to the dictionary and we're

424
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
like what does a dictionary say about

425
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
the word technical what does the

426
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,559
dictionary say about the word engineer

427
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,360
um so does anybody in here like maintain

428
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
public works like build bridges or

429
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
anybody anybody maintain engines anybody

430
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
like electronic engineer

431
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
no i was kind of hoping there'd be one

432
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,320
structural engineer

433
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,280
no

434
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,879
wait there are no engineers in this room

435
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,799
so

436
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,160
i thought this was really interesting i

437
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
also love the fact that engineer is both

438
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,919
a noun and a verb that kind of cracked

439
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,200
me up when i was doing the work i was

440
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
like oh i can i can i mean it makes

441
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,799
sense right we talk about engineering a

442
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,280
solution we also talk about humans as

443
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
engineers

444
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
so that's what the oxford language

445
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,400
dictionary says

446
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,360
um

447
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
so why do we

448
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
not know what to call things and why do

449
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
we have this problem

450
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,039
i'll be really honest i do think a lot

451
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
of it is unconscious bias

452
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
right like we

453
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
don't mean to stereotype but we do and

454
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
we've all taken like well maybe i

455
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,200
shouldn't have seen things a lot of us

456
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,440
have taken some sort of bias training at

457
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
work right we all talk about it

458
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
so i do think that is definitely a

459
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,760
problem

460
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,080
there's the affinity bias like we like

461
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
people like ourselves

462
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
i mean

463
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,799
it's really funny if you ever go through

464
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
your network to spend some time like my

465
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,039
network is obviously more heavily

466
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,440
weighted towards women even though i'm

467
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
obviously in an industry that is more

468
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,280
heavily weighted towards men

469
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,440
but that's an affinity bias

470
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,720
um

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
you got confirmation bias hey i do pen

472
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,799
testing so i like the person who does

473
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
pen testing because they're cool

474
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,000
i actually don't do a pen testing but

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
that was an example um

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
there's also time pressure right like

477
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
you've got to make decisions quick so

478
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,840
when you think about your interview

479
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,520
experience right you're trying to make a

480
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,039
judgment you've got 60 minutes to figure

481
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,039
out is this person the right human for

482
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,320
the right job

483
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
there's a time pressure there

484
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
and i also think this one's key

485
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,600
we've got a lot of really hard problems

486
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
to solve that we don't know how to solve

487
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
there's just too much ambiguity and so

488
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,600
we say oh we just need someone technical

489
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
to solve our problems

490
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
so how does that impact our industry

491
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,600
well

492
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,640
i think this data is at a date right

493
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,559
we but they estimate we'll have 3.5

494
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,039
million openings in cyber security now i

495
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,880
know there's a big debate whether this

496
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
is accurate data or not

497
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,799
but

498
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,720
look even tech recruiters say there's

499
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
bias

500
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,919
like let's be real like this is a real

501
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,600
problem for us

502
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
and we know

503
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
that there's bias and performance

504
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
reviews and promotions and unfortunately

505
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,080
they impact women and underrepresented

506
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,440
more minorities

507
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,559
much greater than folks in the majority

508
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,000
and if we want to be an inclusive

509
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
industry we've got to tackle this

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
so i'm going to turn it back to josh for

511
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
how we're going to tackle this

512
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,679
tackle i used to play football i know

513
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,520
this oh wait

514
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,679
so

515
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,400
this technical trap is a huge impact

516
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
and

517
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,919
anyone can be trapped in this

518
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,919
you think about throughout your career

519
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,159
if you've ever had a review where they

520
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,760
the review feedback was you know i

521
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
really want you to be more technical

522
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,439
you know i really want you to

523
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,000
code more

524
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
when you're working as a network

525
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,440
engineer

526
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,480
these things act as gates these keep

527
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,159
individuals from you know progressing in

528
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,080
their career and if you're that

529
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,760
individual getting told that over and

530
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,679
over you're not technical you're not

531
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,760
technical you're not technical what are

532
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
you going to start to believe

533
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
so

534
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
i tried to generalize the addressing

535
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,559
this

536
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,280
for

537
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,600
something for both ics

538
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
and folks who have management so i run a

539
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
team of about 25

540
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,600
and

541
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
the first thing that i

542
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
tell folks to do is

543
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
it's all about sitting with the

544
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
uncomfortable and getting ready to be

545
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
uncomfortable

546
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
because

547
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
there are times that you are the person

548
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
being held back by this trap and there

549
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
are times that you're the person

550
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,918
implementing this trap

551
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
we all can have biases

552
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,200
so acknowledge that

553
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,679
there is bias in our language there is a

554
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
lack of clarity

555
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,640
in a lot of our language and how we

556
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
apply it and how we measure others

557
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
against it

558
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,240
and take that time to intentionally

559
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
ponder what that means

560
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
so when i say intentionally ponder it's

561
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,919
really

562
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,840
taking a moment to to

563
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,280
sit quietly and think about your own

564
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,039
life experience and do you have an

565
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
example in your life where you're like

566
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
yeah i got told i wasn't technical and

567
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
i'd like

568
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,679
kind of shrugged and went what do you

569
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,840
mean

570
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
question

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,679
so

572
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
as a trapper

573
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
am i making assumptions about skill sets

574
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,120
needed based on

575
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,159
me like i've been in this job for 25

576
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,919
years i know what a cyber security

577
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,280
professional does

578
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
and what they need to be able to do

579
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
do i have any data to support that no

580
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,879
but my god

581
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,760
questioning the ambiguous statements so

582
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,000
you know even during our interaction

583
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,960
here

584
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
we had statements of like

585
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,159
coding or scripting

586
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,760
if i walked into

587
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,679
my computer science class from two

588
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,240
decades ago

589
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
and asked you know what coding meant

590
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
there was an assembler class

591
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
and there was a cfos class

592
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
and i guarantee you those classes

593
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,000
thought very differently on to what they

594
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
meant by coding

595
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
so this is where we talk and we'll talk

596
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
about precision

597
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,520
uh questioning about my default values

598
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,279
you know i found for myself when i do

599
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,720
this insertion

600
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,440
i have the default value of

601
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
pen testing because you don't pen test

602
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
you're not cyber security

603
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
i have the default value of coding

604
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
because if you can't do python it wasn't

605
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,720
just coding it was python you can't do

606
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,880
python you're not cybersecurity

607
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,200
and i had nothing in there about risk i

608
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
had nothing in there about controls and

609
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
you know going across domains

610
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
so

611
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
you know questioning and also getting

612
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
that outside perspective so as you're

613
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
questioning going to your peers and

614
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,120
going to your friends and having this

615
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
discussion

616
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
you know your friends you love them they

617
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
love you

618
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,320
and in that reflection sir

619
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
because again we are nerds

620
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,360
start playing some experiments

621
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,400
try a new ground rule for behavior like

622
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,320
as a manager i cannot use the word

623
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,600
technical in any of my reviews

624
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
as i see when i'm writing my own review

625
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
i cannot use that phrase i cannot use

626
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,000
the term uh coding in my reviews

627
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
i need to reflect what i'm actually

628
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
doing you reflect the skill set that i'm

629
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
utilizing

630
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,360
uh and the test the other test and

631
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
experiment that i implemented was uh

632
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,200
less instinct more intentional

633
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
meaning

634
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,880
taking that time especially when working

635
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,240
with others and working on my own side

636
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
to say okay what is the skill we're

637
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,200
looking at

638
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,480
uh and where are they adding it

639
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
on the awareness side

640
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,320
uh we joke about the the trap iocs

641
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,039
the indicators of cot or compromise or

642
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,720
whatever we want to call them these days

643
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
but

644
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
as a ic or manager take a look at your

645
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,480
review feedback

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
and looking for those ambiguous

647
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,000
statements

648
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,919
reading the statements as if

649
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,520
you were someone completely outside the

650
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
situation and going

651
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,080
if i read this statement of hey could

652
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
work on x

653
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,400
could work on x technical skill set

654
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
is that clear enough to actually tell me

655
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,679
what that person should do or tell me

656
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
what i should be doing or my reports

657
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
should be doing

658
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
assignment trends and this is something

659
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
that i encourage anyone who has a people

660
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,960
reporting to them

661
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
start looking at and keeping track of

662
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
the type of work that your people are

663
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,679
being assigned

664
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,400
this is one of those sneaky ones because

665
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,840
you know it's uh we're all on the

666
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,200
security architecture team they're doing

667
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
architecture work

668
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
i found at one point i definitely had

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
one person who was doing way more

670
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
control writing

671
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,159
than they were doing systems

672
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,919
architecture

673
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
and there was a default that had to be

674
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,520
fixed at the belief that you know this

675
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,200
person didn't have a skill set there

676
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
we talk about the lack of documented

677
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
scope and you know anytime you have a

678
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
work task or an item

679
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
having that clear what are we trying to

680
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
do here so you can actually go and talk

681
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,720
about skill sets

682
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
which brings us into where i talk about

683
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
precision

684
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
like

685
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
as

686
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,679
individuals in cyber security and again

687
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
i don't care if you are a manager or

688
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,720
director

689
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,360
consultant and i see

690
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
precision is one of the biggest tools to

691
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
root out bias and to fight the technical

692
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,960
trap

693
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
meaning when you have work that's

694
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,760
assigned to you or you're signing out

695
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,120
if your work has anyone had an

696
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,520
assignment saying engineer a new system

697
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
i certainly have

698
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,840
and engineer a new data system

699
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,158
great

700
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,880
the next task was to go break it up and

701
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
actually figure out what that meant

702
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
but when it was reported out and talked

703
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,760
about all it was talked about was oh

704
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,279
they engineered this data system they

705
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,159
engineered this system

706
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
the skill sets needed for the roles that

707
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
are actually being enacted and this is

708
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
where we talk about the day-to-day work

709
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,200
and being precise about what an

710
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,039
individual is supposed to be doing

711
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
i'm going to say the the scary word i'm

712
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,880
going to say you know career ladders and

713
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,960
role definitions

714
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
who here at work

715
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,399
has ever had a career ladder

716
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,559
yeah building one or use it so

717
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,080
career ladders

718
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,799
have a both very positive conversation

719
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,559
and a very negative connotation in our

720
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,919
industry

721
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,760
because some folks when they're built

722
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,360
they end up being this check box to

723
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
promotion

724
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,520
and in others they end up being this you

725
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
know pathway or guide

726
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
so when you look at a role or an

727
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
organization

728
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,600
and if there are no

729
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,279
career path

730
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,720
and i'll use that as an alternative

731
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
phrase career paths

732
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
that define skills required not be more

733
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
technical and when we say skills

734
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
required we're down to

735
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,559
they need to be able to write python

736
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
they need to build a pen test linux

737
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
systems they need to be able to you know

738
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
map controls from cyst to stig

739
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,200
these are skills that we can measure

740
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,159
against

741
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,880
and not have ambiguous

742
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
hand-to-sky statements about how someone

743
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,840
is doing

744
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,480
as you look at those skill set

745
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,679
breakdowns one of the questions that

746
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,440
i'll ask with each one is

747
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
if i'm measuring someone on a skill set

748
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,960
how do they train on that skill set

749
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
because if they can't train on the skill

750
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
set either i've got a terrible skill set

751
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,279
that just no one knows but the mystic

752
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,559
master over in some faraway land

753
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,240
or i've got a skill set that i haven't

754
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,039
properly defined

755
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
and if i'm

756
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
measuring or measuring folks on skill

757
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,760
sets that they can't train on

758
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,240
how do they succeed

759
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,159
curiosity can only get you so far

760
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
and

761
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
the last one i want to call about a

762
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
precision is

763
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,480
ensuring that

764
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
what we're measuring and looking at

765
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
folks on and what we're measuring

766
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
ourselves on

767
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,960
is it actually applicable to the core of

768
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,799
the role that we're in or the role we're

769
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,080
going to

770
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
or is it a one-off

771
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
for example i had an engineer at one

772
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
point get

773
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,200
assessed

774
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,919
on not knowing how to implement juniper

775
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,039
firewall because the one weekend one

776
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,840
time

777
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
there was a need to fix something on a

778
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
juniper firewall wasn't their job wasn't

779
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,679
their role they didn't know the skill

780
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
set the feedback came to me oh this

781
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,840
person's not technical

782
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,440
they couldn't fix the juniper fireball

783
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
who here can go ahead and fix the gender

784
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,678
for firewall

785
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,919
wait i thought you're wrong there we go

786
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
all right we've got one juniper engineer

787
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,480
i thought you were in cyber security

788
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,880
isn't that a cyber security skill

789
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,399
sorry

790
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,399
i get a little fired up on this topic i

791
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,159
apologize

792
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,279
um

793
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,640
but

794
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,880
so

795
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,480
oh dear

796
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
oh

797
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,640
we have the wrong version now

798
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
um

799
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,320
do you want to just do summary

800
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,880
where's the summary slide

801
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,360
uh we have the usual fun of a slide

802
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,039
issue

803
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,919
one second please

804
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,519
oh there it is

805
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
we like to hide slides from people

806
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,799
apparently i'm sorry that's my fault

807
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,919
actually it's a bit more of an

808
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,400
engineering concept

809
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,559
[Applause]

810
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,880
so in summary like we all can't fill our

811
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
roles let's be clear we have way too

812
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
much demand

813
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,799
but we don't need to sink our own ships

814
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,279
right like so

815
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,480
we need to

816
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,519
really

817
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,919
let you got to stop letting bias stop

818
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,240
you right so actually this applies i

819
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,159
would say even more often when we're

820
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,559
interviewing right so you're doing the

821
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,240
debrief you've had this great

822
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,600
conversation

823
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,120
and somebody's like oh

824
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
i mean they were great but they weren't

825
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,799
technical like that

826
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,159
there's no way that hasn't happened to

827
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
people in this room in a deep brief

828
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,600
so

829
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
like stop the person who says that and

830
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
says okay well tell me what you mean

831
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,559
what did what skill do they not have

832
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,960
that you think is essential to this role

833
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,360
like fight back when people say oh

834
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,799
they're not technical because there's

835
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,720
probably some sort of unconscious bias

836
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
going on and like let's just call a

837
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
spade a spade

838
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,480
um i think this impacts ics and managers

839
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
a hundred percent and it impacts

840
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,640
everybody in our industry

841
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,399
because either you will be told at some

842
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,559
point you're not technical enough

843
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,840
or maybe you'll have the delightful

844
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
experience that i had which was i was

845
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,559
working uh for my company on a booth

846
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,399
someone walked up to me they're like you

847
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,559
know oh what do you do i'm a technical

848
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,919
at the time i was a technical program

849
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,320
manager and they're like

850
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,799
can i talk to someone technical and i

851
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,720
was like wait i think it's in my

852
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,919
i'm like okay like i get it like you

853
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,480
heard the word program manager and

854
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,159
decided

855
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,320
i wasn't technical even like literally

856
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
it's in the title but it happens right

857
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,440
and i think it's how we respond

858
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,679
um to hearing stuff like that and we

859
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,679
don't let it stop us

860
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,640
and as i said it impacts ice managers

861
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,840
everybody we all have to be in this

862
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,600
together um as we mentioned earlier

863
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
there's a lot of there's both anecdotal

864
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,320
data that we saw um

865
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,480
that indicates greater harm to

866
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,720
unrepresented minorities than women and

867
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
like we want to make this an inclusive

868
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,320
industry like we want to make sure

869
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,480
there's everybody because let's be clear

870
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
we don't want diversity for diversity

871
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,880
sake we want it because the more people

872
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,640
with different backgrounds that come in

873
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
and join in a conversation you get a

874
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,760
better outcome like that has been proved

875
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
again and again and again

876
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
so like let's embrace it for the awesome

877
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,919
business enabler it is

878
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,039
um and to combat it it takes focus you

879
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,720
you've got to commit to this it's not

880
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,800
something i can just say like i'm just

881
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,719
going to like not fall trap no you have

882
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,000
to commit

883
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,159
um i think reflection is the most

884
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,879
powerful tool there is i remember i was

885
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,800
in business school and

886
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,480
each week we had to reflect on stuff and

887
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,839
i was like this is an amazing tool i

888
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,480
wish i had this in my tool set earlier

889
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,320
because it just allows you to learn in a

890
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
different way

891
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,520
so reflect

892
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,480
like commit to becoming aware

893
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,639
and get precise like if you're saying

894
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,679
like i need a technical person

895
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,480
really what do you need like it's not

896
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,918
sufficient anymore to say i need a

897
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,399
technical person or i need an engineer

898
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,879
what exactly do you need what skills do

899
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,560
they have to have when they walk in the

900
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,679
door

901
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,800
versus what can you train them on like

902
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,320
what do you have a really exciting

903
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,239
candidate that you believe you can train

904
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,160
are you gonna let your bias of like they

905
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
don't know how to pen test stop you

906
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,680
i would hope not

907
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,920
but plenty of people do

908
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,760
so get precise know what you want

909
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
and we would love uh feedback

910
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,000
like

911
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,079
if you liked this if you didn't like

912
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,440
this um

913
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
we're feedback at bsidesfeedback.com

914
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,400
yeah we just did that in the speaker

915
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
room yeah we're like that um and we'd

916
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
love to open up for questions i think we

917
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
still have time i'm not watching the

918
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,200
timer um or anything else like any

919
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,240
comments people want to say like really

920
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
did appreciate everybody participating

921
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
if you're participated out i understand

922
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,720
but if you're not

923
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,240
we would love to hear any thoughts

924
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,440
i think that buyers are out there being

925
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
technical or not typical can manifest in

926
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
different ways

927
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
i have experience with it manifesting

928
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,800
from the other side when somebody

929
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,040
considered to be too technical

930
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,520
in order to be good enough with you know

931
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
soft skills on these people

932
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,760
and this was not based on any kind of

933
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,680
actual experience with that person

934
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
playing that role but simply an

935
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,400
assumption that you know a good engineer

936
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,560
is probably not also a good manager at

937
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,160
the same time

938
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
right and i think that i mean if that is

939
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,960
the case and really it's just a standard

940
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,440
for you know like the bias expresses

941
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,160
itself in multiple different ways i

942
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
think that we shouldn't be just looking

943
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,640
for specifically a new bias around

944
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,040
the term due to technical

945
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,680
but about the biased approach to

946
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,599
assessing people

947
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,480
you know

948
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,200
whatever terms are used to describe kind

949
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
of the pitch and call the person

950
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,520
based on the frequency of notions

951
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,240
such so true you know the statement uh

952
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,920
and kind of some re-summarize of like

953
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
bias impacts in

954
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,520
all directions

955
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
and we talk about so you know getting

956
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
precise on what's actually needed by a

957
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,280
skill set and also taking that time to

958
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
reflect and asking others to reflect and

959
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,000
like why is it that you say that

960
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,079
this person who's an engineer

961
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
doesn't have leadership skills well

962
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,599
they're an engineer

963
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,200
okay what does that mean

964
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,880
and you know some of the times taking

965
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,240
that socratic questioning and just

966
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,440
taking someone down that road

967
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,320
you get

968
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,839
you get some amazing results when that

969
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,400
person's eyes start to light up and go

970
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,839
crap

971
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,839
i'm just assuming that oh the engineer

972
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,760
can't talk to humans but

973
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
what do you do

974
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
what do you do when the person you're

975
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
talking to doesn't know the specifics

976
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
and just uses technical as an umbrella

977
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,800
term because they don't know what they

978
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,760
need

979
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,400
so i i can speak from my experience

980
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
depends situationally i'd love to say

981
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
that there's a catch-all golden answer

982
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,119
but i still i'm following down the if

983
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
you cannot specify beyond the word

984
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,280
technical then we are not in a position

985
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,760
to assess the individual

986
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,599
if you cannot specify beyond the word

987
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,000
engineer we are not a position to assess

988
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,640
the individual and we need to fix that

989
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
that's the problem now and i'm going to

990
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,560
focus on that problem and once we fix

991
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,079
that problem we come back to assessing

992
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,280
the individual or the group of

993
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,839
individuals

994
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,359
yeah at least for myself i mean i've

995
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,200
experienced this in job interviews and

996
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
oftentimes coming from people other than

997
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,599
the hiring manager who has some

998
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,119
misconception

999
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,119
about the role in one case i was

1000
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,760
interviewing for a security manager role

1001
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,359
and the director of development had

1002
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,960
something you know stuck in his head

1003
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
that i had to you know the role had to

1004
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
be a pin tester

1005
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,400
and i was not a pin tester and in my

1006
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,599
opinion

1007
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,040
that's not what the tournament should be

1008
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,079
doing you know but he was just

1009
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,400
you know couldn't get over that and

1010
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,960
try to get the

1011
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,320
yeah so the um what i heard was uh

1012
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,480
around like having that situation where

1013
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
it's not in a hiring situation where

1014
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,560
it's not even necessarily the hiring and

1015
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
as a candidate you won't know this you

1016
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,000
won't know who it is on the back end

1017
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,480
that's like well that person can't bake

1018
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,079
bread so obviously they're not a good

1019
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,599
systems engineer

1020
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,200
uh loaf of bread is good but

1021
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
one thing i found to be helpful is

1022
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,240
actually

1023
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
emphasizing my soft skills especially

1024
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
when it comes to translating technical

1025
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,000
concepts into

1026
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,160
um more approachable things

1027
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,079
uh so being able to communicate

1028
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,160
cross-functionally to less technical

1029
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,440
teams actually shows me to be a stronger

1030
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,400
technical person um i think it's called

1031
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
uh counter-signing um but basically like

1032
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,560
being able to

1033
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,160
dumb things down without making the

1034
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,640
other people feel stupid has been really

1035
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
valuable in

1036
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,480
getting myself higher and higher as a

1037
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,000
technical person

1038
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
because i'm able to get more support

1039
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,319
from more parts of the company and like

1040
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,400
ceos aren't always the most technical

1041
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,839
critters sometimes they're a business

1042
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
critter

1043
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,000
if you can tell them why you're doing a

1044
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,920
good job or why the engineer just kicked

1045
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,520
past learning all of terraform in a

1046
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,880
weekend

1047
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,359
you become more valuable as a technical

1048
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,200
resource as more like a technical

1049
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,400
consultant

1050
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
and so that might be something that is

1051
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
more helpful

1052
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,119
like to

1053
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,200
very work on as well as this stuff very

1054
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,480
true and and i love like taking you know

1055
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,560
we we sometimes talk about engineering

1056
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,880
technical like we're this isolated thing

1057
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,599
that we exist just for ourselves

1058
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,400
um

1059
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,720
i other than some non-profits out there

1060
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
i think most of us work for a company

1061
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,240
that you know makes profit and does

1062
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
something

1063
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,480
you know

1064
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
and has other uh facilities and like you

1065
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,520
said to be able to to communicate what

1066
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
what does it mean that the bumper on the

1067
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,880
car has been installed three seconds

1068
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,800
faster well that means this in the

1069
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
business world and i know we're having

1070
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
the conversations now about the csombiso

1071
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,880
discussions which i think are going to

1072
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,240
be interesting in the next few years

1073
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
could part of the problem be the

1074
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,200
unrealistic expectations of

1075
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
people just starting out in the industry

1076
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,599
because

1077
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,520
they're new to it but the cyber security

1078
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,359
industry is short of people so they have

1079
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,079
slightly unrealistic salary expectations

1080
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,240
so in bigger companies to get those

1081
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,720
roles it needs the title of

1082
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,960
engineer or

1083
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,560
whatever so

1084
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,800
could that be part of the problem i i

1085
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,040
again i can only speak for for the aries

1086
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,119
uh for my experience but

1087
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
definitely we you know we do have um if

1088
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,119
common practice if you have an

1089
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,599
engineering title or a developer job

1090
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,640
class

1091
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,880
your pay band is different than if you

1092
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
are a you know technician

1093
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,160
um

1094
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,200
and

1095
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,079
sorry

1096
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,520
um and you know the other part of your

1097
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,599
statement there around kind of

1098
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,680
folks starting out with

1099
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,520
and i wanted to clarify do you mean the

1100
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,599
folks the new people have on real

1101
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,599
expectations on themselves or the

1102
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,440
companies have unreal expectations of

1103
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,240
new folks coming in

1104
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,560
uh so the the discussion of like

1105
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,319
i need to come into the industry as an

1106
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,680
engineer because that's a better pay

1107
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,720
band

1108
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,839
so

1109
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,520
but even at that point

1110
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,920
as a hiring manager or as someone you

1111
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,800
know looking to fill out roles

1112
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,119
my role title may be engineer

1113
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,440
but my job description and my checklist

1114
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,599
for all my rehirers are

1115
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,200
skills

1116
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,000
and if those skills aren't there

1117
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,520
then we shouldn't hire that candidate

1118
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
so i

1119
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,079
something that i've experienced that i

1120
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,160
think is tangentially related to

1121
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
everything we're talking about

1122
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,920
is a desire for

1123
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,400
candidates uh and i'm speaking as a

1124
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,520
candidate

1125
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,400
going into job interviews a desire for

1126
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,800
candidates to have the experience which

1127
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,880
they cannot have without having the

1128
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,160
experience

1129
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,839
if that makes sense like

1130
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,040
getting the initial experience is a huge

1131
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,280
barrier as someone who's coming into

1132
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,240
security without an i.t background

1133
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,359
and that's um

1134
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,400
uh

1135
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,560
it can be kind of brutal

1136
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,040
in my experience yeah

1137
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
what what is your background

1138
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,119
uh i was a farmer

1139
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,160
um and then in 2019 i took a cyber

1140
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,400
security boot camp and then kind of went

1141
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,000
off on a tangent with it and found my

1142
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,440
tribe

1143
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,720
that's awesome hell yeah

1144
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,200
startups

1145
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,280
are so desperate for everyone please go

1146
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,560
find some startups they have no idea

1147
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,760
what the hell they're doing they're so

1148
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,560
precious and wonderful also contracting

1149
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,280
um contracting is great because

1150
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,960
if you do a small project for someone

1151
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,880
and it doesn't work out it doesn't

1152
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,480
matter so put on your linkedin as

1153
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,200
contracting great oh i keep my client

1154
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,440
less private that means i can call your

1155
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,560
references um right

1156
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,200
and if it does work out then you do get

1157
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
a lot of really good experience and you

1158
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,960
can still dip out whenever it gets too

1159
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,599
crazy so highly recommend startups and

1160
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,960
contracting

1161
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,839
and

1162
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,640
keep trying it's crazy and like

1163
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,599
adjacent stuff i'm in qa

1164
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,359
i come to security conferences because

1165
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,000
it scares the crap out of me and because

1166
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,160
sometimes i get to wedge some security

1167
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,720
bugs in as qa bugs

1168
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,520
so there are sneaky ways in thanks for

1169
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
sure

1170
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,359
okay

1171
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,240
oh

1172
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,760
what about what about these entry-level

1173
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,640
positions that are advertising for uh

1174
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,240
candidates with two or three years of

1175
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,480
experience and assist

1176
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,680
that so i want to reiterate uh restate

1177
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,040
the so essentially the question again

1178
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,599
about the the

1179
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,839
the hiring field today where we still

1180
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,520
have this

1181
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,240
terrible job description mantra

1182
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,000
entry-level position

1183
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,160
two to three years experience cissp

1184
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,920
required which requires five years of

1185
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,280
experience before you can get the full

1186
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,720
cissp so

1187
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
the unfortunate side of that is that has

1188
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,040
to be corrected by the companies

1189
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,119
like as a as someone coming at the

1190
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,520
candidate uh you know other than

1191
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,280
you could say hey this seems like we're

1192
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,680
unrealistic expectations but that you

1193
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,800
know as a candidate isn't really going

1194

you in that situation

1196
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,960
what i treat it as is

1197
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
those are red flags for me for companies

1198
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,480
i don't want to work for

1199

because they have not taken the time to

1200
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,960
reassess their job descriptions to look

1201
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
for biases to look for issues and to try

1202
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
to make sure that they're recruiting in

1203
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,599
a different fashion and opening up the

1204
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,560
