here we are again

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
it's been three years i think since i've

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,040
been here so this is uh

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
i mean in person right because

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,560
it's been like three years since any of

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
us have been here in person for this

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
event

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,400
um you know i once gave a talk

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
in an airplane hangar

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
i think it was quieter there

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,119
i mean i'm glad because it's keeping us

52
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
safe we've got the air purifiers this is

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
wonderful but wow

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
um so i'm excited to be here

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
um really excited to see all your faces

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
and

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,759
you know what let's let's just dive

58
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,520
right into this thing so we're talking

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,799
about

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,880
talking to the board

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
which i know for a lot of people maybe

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,520
we don't get that opportunity so

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
even if you're not speaking to boards

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,640
i'm going to try to make this applicable

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,400
because it really these concepts apply

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
anytime you're talking cyber security to

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,360
someone who maybe isn't

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
all there on the cyber security side of

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,239
things

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
which makes up the vast majority of

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,440
people that we're trying to talk to in

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
most of our jobs

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
so i figure that

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
that kind of fits so a little bit about

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
me first of all that is that's me

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
did you did you figure that out i mean

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
i don't know

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
first and foremost i'm a hacker and a

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
researcher i'm a lifelong hacker if you

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
look at my bio it says it every time

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
i was that kid who took my toys apart at

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
12 years old i went out got a paper

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,239
route saved up a bunch of money went to

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
best buy and i bought a computer and a

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
couple months later i hacked into this

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,319
thing

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,920

thank god that's done that is a hell of

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,159
a process i don't want to i don't want

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,519
to do another one anytime soon let me

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
just put it that way and

106
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,519
the reason i'm here talking on this

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
particular topic i've been in leadership

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
for 16 years

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
cyber security leadership

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
back

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,959
i go way back to when i was leading a

112
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,640
penetration testing and vulnerability

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
management program for a financial

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
services company i went through

115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,640
years and consulting work and

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
working for reseller and for a product

117
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,720
company but

118
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
you know

119
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,599
in that time i

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
i had the opportunity to speak to a lot

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,319
of boards

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,400
and in fact my previous role before i

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,799
joined epic global

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,720
i had responsibility for reporting into

125
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
eight separate boards

126
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,880
that sounds ridiculous but when you

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,639
understand that regulators when you're

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,880
in a highly regulated industry

129
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
they like to appoint their own advisory

130
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
boards

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
and

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
so you end up talking to them a lot too

133
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
so think about what that does now i mean

134
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
before i got into that role

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
i you know i had spoken to i'd been a

136
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
consultant so i was used to going into

137
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,759
the boardroom and having those

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
conversations going to elt meetings

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
little executive leadership team

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
meetings and talking to executive

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
leaders and explaining to them you know

142
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
what was going on in their organizations

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,600
and things that they needed to be aware

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,840
of and

145
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,520
so but it was when i got to this

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
particular role i used to work at s p

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
global

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,320
and

149
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
you know i walked into my first board

150
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,039
meeting

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
and it was

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
it was still a little daunting because

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
that was the first time like i was

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
reporting to the board for my own

155
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
company

156
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,520
and i got in there and you know i

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
spent some time in the lead up really

158
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
thinking about how i was going to

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,720
present i got in there i presented and

160
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
i know this is a little maybe it's a

161
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,919
little humble brag i don't mean it that

162
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
way but we get to the end of it and the

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
thing i remember most about it and what

164
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,919
really inspired me to have this

165
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,080
conversation and to do this talk for you

166
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
all today

167
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,759
was one of the board members who stopped

168
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,759
me and he said you know i think i can

169
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
speak for everybody here when i say

170
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
cyber security is the thing that keeps

171
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,080
us up most at night

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
and for the first time i actually feel

173
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
comfortable

174
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
that we've got somebody in place who's

175
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
got this in hand

176
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
then he went on to say

177
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,319
i've been on the board for seven years

178
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
and that's the best presentation i've

179
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
seen on this topic

180
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,560
now that's not me bragging

181
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
on me yeah it's great and wonderful and

182
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
i'm really excited because my my boss

183
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,000
was there to hear it and so that went

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
over really well

185
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
but no the reason i i tell you that is

186
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,199
because as i said that was the

187
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
inspiration because i got to think like

188
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
wait you've been hearing from our cso

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
for years

190
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
why now that a be so business

191
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
information security officer is in front

192
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
of you is this the best presentation

193
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
you've ever heard

194
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
and i started really paying attention to

195
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
what i was hearing from peers in the

196
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
industry

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
and

198
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
i started to become aware that like you

199
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,639
know what

200
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,560
we've been fighting for a long time to

201
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
get to the board

202
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,280
right

203
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
i can remember back in those 16 years

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
we've been talking about there's been

205
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
media articles everything else about how

206
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
the csos just don't get time in front of

207
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
the board and how cesaro's need to be

208
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,840
there we need to have more of that

209
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
opportunity and that goes for all of

210
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
cyber security and you know what we're

211
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,440
getting progress

212
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,639
i don't know how many of you saw us from

213
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
the sec but the sec is actually putting

214
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,759
out guidance now that says cyber

215
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,039
security needs to be a part of the

216
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
boardroom discussion

217
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,919
that we need to have cyber security

218
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
experts in the boardroom

219
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
but what i worry when i hear comments

220
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
like that from board members by the way

221
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
board members who had to ask me what a

222
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
cso was

223
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
okay

224
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
when i hear that you know

225
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
those presentations haven't been going

226
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,639
so well and they haven't been getting

227
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,039
that comfort level

228
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
it tells me we're not ready for this as

229
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
cyber security folks in general

230
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
or at least that we have room to improve

231
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
so that's what really inspired this and

232
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
so as i said i kind of took that to

233
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
heart like it's important to me to

234
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
analyze things like that that's just

235
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
kind of how i am i overthink things

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
anybody else in here one of those people

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
who just kind of overthinks things

238
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
probably most of the room right

239
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
and you know so

240
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
i got to thinking and i'm like i started

241
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
like i said i started really listening

242
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
to what people were saying in the

243
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
industry and i realized

244
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
there's a lot of really

245
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
misguided things things that i'm going

246
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,639
to call myths

247
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
now i don't say that to be derogatory

248
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,039
but they're things that we've

249
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
we've tried over the years

250
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
things that a lot of times many of these

251
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
scenes and things have been come cliche

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
and we've kind of accepted them as truth

253
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
but i don't think they're really true

254
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
and so i'm going to start there and i

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
want to really dig into some of these

256
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,680
because i'm sure some of you have heard

257
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
these

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
some of you may subscribe to him i've

259
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
said them myself

260
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
so i'm not proclaiming innocence here

261
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
i'm proclaiming that i've given us a lot

262
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
of thought and i think there's a better

263
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
way

264
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,360
so let's dive into these because i

265
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
i think it has to start with

266
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
understanding what i believe we're doing

267
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
wrong today when we get in front of the

268
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
board

269
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
so

270
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
anyone heard this never let a good

271
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
crisis go to waste

272
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
what does that mean to you

273
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
to me when i talk to people it seems to

274
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
mean that like hey we just had a breach

275
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
or something so the pocketbooks are open

276
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
and i can spend all the money

277
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
and we approach it that way right

278
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
i mean i've read articles on this we saw

279
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
this with past high-profile breaches in

280
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,959
the industry where you know what hey we

281
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
had a big breach we went out spent a

282
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
couple million dollars over the course

283
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
of a year or 18 months and then we just

284
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
kind of forgot about cyber security and

285
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
 we got breached again

286
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
shocking

287
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,120
but it's because we approach it like

288
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
this now imagine you're in a breach

289
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,279
and imagine you go in there with this

290
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,120
line

291
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,800
from mr mueller

292
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
now how many of you

293
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
and don't be shy because i will raise my

294
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
hand too have uttered these words or

295
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
something similar before

296
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
it's not if but when

297
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
imagine going into your board and you

298
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
say or your executive leaders you say

299
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
you know what

300
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
it's not if we get breached but when

301
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
now spend two million dollars on that

302
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
iem solution so i can make sure we don't

303
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
get breached

304
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
how effective is that

305
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,480
now we wonder why they don't want to

306
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
give us money

307
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,279
and that's the kind of thing that

308
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,399
happens

309
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
we go in there and we've had a breach

310
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
and we talk about well we need this we

311
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
need this we need this

312
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
and it sets the stage that well we

313
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
weren't doing anything we weren't doing

314
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,959
these things right

315
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,839
and so once we fix them then we'll be

316
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,360
secure and that's the narrative that we

317
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
build when we go in there and we take

318
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
that idea of don't let a good crisis go

319
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
to waste spend all the money now

320
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
now there are good ways to make use of a

321
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,200
good crisis i'm not gonna lie and we'll

322
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,959
get to that

323
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,160
but going in there and just thinking

324
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
that the crisis is your excuse to get

325
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
funding and that's how you want to drive

326
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,160
it

327
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
there might be better ways because as

328
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,079
i'll share later i've watched to cecil

329
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,599
get fired for mishandling this

330
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
so our second myth

331
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
security is a risk management function

332
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
we've heard this one before

333
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,760
some of you

334
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
i see a few nodding heads

335
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,399
really

336
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
do we want to minimize what we do down

337
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
to risk management

338
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
is that all we do

339
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
i mean

340
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,120
risk management's responsible for a lot

341
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,320
of things

342
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
if i look at this risk management what

343
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,160
plays into business risk

344
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
there's a whole lot of different things

345
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
here

346
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
if i think about the brick wall that is

347
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,079
risk management all those various bricks

348
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
cyber security is one little brick in

349
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
that wall

350
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,920
i really hope we're delivering more than

351
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
just risk management because

352
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
that really kind of minimizes the value

353
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
that we bring to an organization and so

354
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,399
when i'm in front of

355
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,279
senior executive board level leaders

356
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
and i say you know what well i

357
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
i i manage risk

358
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
i've already got a risk management team

359
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
that does that you're just one little

360
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
area of that so

361
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
clearly cyber security is just a small

362
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,279
component

363
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,279
if i've only got 10 people on my risk

364
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,800
management team why do you need 50 for

365
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,519
cyber security

366
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
see how that logic works

367
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
that's what you're putting in it

368
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,440
remember these are people who don't do

369
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
cyber security every day as their day

370
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
job

371
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,440
to us we understand why do i need 50

372
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
people when there's only 10 in risk

373
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,399
management

374
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
but to them when i say my job is risk

375
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,000
management i'm a risk management

376
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
function

377
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,480
that's what i'm telling them i'm just a

378
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
small piece but there's the whole other

379
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
side i hate venn diagrams by the way but

380
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
they tend to be useful sometimes

381
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,279
there's all the other stuff that we do

382
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,639
that isn't risk management

383
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,320
and we'll talk more about that a little

384
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,720
bit later too

385
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
an offshoot

386
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,040
this one has come up more recently

387
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
so i hear a lot of csos

388
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,360
and i love that they talk about this

389
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
saying

390
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
security's job is to enable the business

391
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,160
i love that

392
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
unfortunately when i ask them what that

393
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
means

394
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
and you prod at that a little bit more

395
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
some of the answers that i'm hearing are

396
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
a little

397
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,120
less than inspiring

398
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
because you know

399
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
i mean

400
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
how does risk how does reducing risk

401
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
enable the business

402
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
think about this for a minute being in

403
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
business the actual inherent existence

404
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
of being in business carries with it

405
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,880
risk

406
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
right if i'm going to start a business

407
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
big or small whatever level i'm at there

408
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,600
is inherently risk just to being in

409
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
business there's all those different

410
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
areas of risk which means that by virtue

411
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
of being in business i have now accepted

412
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,920
that risk as tolerable enough to stay in

413
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
business

414
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,839
so if all that security does for me is

415
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,600
reduce that risk that i've already said

416
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,320
is acceptable

417
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
well that's not very exciting

418
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,399
that kind of makes me question why am i

419
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,760
spending millions of dollars on a

420
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
security program every year

421
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,639
the other problem here is does anybody

422
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
know the four ways you can manage risk

423
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,279
there's

424
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,639
there's four techniques for managing

425
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
risk do you know what they are i know

426
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,199
it's gonna be hard to hear you

427
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
i think i heard them and they're

428
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
similar to what i've got but yeah it's

429
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
you can avoid the risk you can reduce

430
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,519
the risk you can accept the risk or you

431
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,519
can transfer it right

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,199
now as security practitioners those

433
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,399
bottom two really get us fired up

434
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
no don't risk accept everything

435
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
okay

436
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
but don't transfer the risk we hate

437
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
cyber security insurance don't do that

438
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
that's not secure

439
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,519
all right

440
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,600
well i could avoid it

441
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
which means i could just shut down those

442
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,720
applications that are high risk

443
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
how many business leaders you think are

444
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,760
going to support that idea of hey let's

445
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
turn off that revenue generating thing

446
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,279
because that cost center in security

447
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,160
says we should do that

448
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,480
that's not such a popular option so

449
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,240
you're kind of left with reduce the risk

450
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,839
that's our only option here that's all

451
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,600
we bring to the table is that one

452
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
component

453
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,959
come on

454
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
we got to do more we want to be we want

455
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
to be more

456
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,279
than just risk

457
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,959
all right my last one i'm harping on

458
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,560
risk because we use this a lot

459
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
oh i love this one the most

460
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,319
the language of business is risk

461
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
walk into your boardroom sometime and

462
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,560
see how much they talk about risk

463
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
is it is the language of business really

464
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,880
risk

465
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
what's the language of risk

466
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
i see it back here

467
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
yo it's money people

468
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
i'm not in business because i want to

469
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
manage risk

470
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
i'm in getting business because i want

471
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
to talk about risk management all day i

472
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
want to talk about how all these

473
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,480
different threats are putting me at risk

474
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
and all the horrible things that i have

475
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
to be aware of every night i'm going to

476
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
be oh my gosh you know these things are

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
going to keep me up and i got that's so

478
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
exciting yes i'm going to go start my

479
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
business no

480
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,839
we get in business and make money

481
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
the language of business is money and

482
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
the avenues for how we make it

483
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
that means innovation that means new

484
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,519
markets that means expanding and getting

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
more efficient cutting costs all the

486
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,959
things that are going to put more

487
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,920
revenue at the top line and indirectly

488
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
put more net income at the bottom line

489
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
that's what the board cares about

490
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,880
all right

491
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,480
because the other day they're there for

492
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,680
the shareholders they're there to make

493
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,959
sure that business is doing the right

494
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,639
things to make money and to protect that

495
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
money and to keep making more

496
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,199
like it or not we live in a capitalist

497
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,959
society that's that's where we're at

498
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,480
that's what we do that's what business

499
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,120
is all about

500
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,279
all right let's move away from risk

501
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,399
because i've beat up there's probably

502
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,680
some like risk management folks in here

503
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,959
right now like god she just keeps

504
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,680
harping on risk okay we get it

505
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
yeah but there is more

506
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,599
the board needs metrics now this isn't

507
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
really a myth because it's not

508
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,199
necessarily false

509
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
this is one of those where we just

510
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,119
our application of the concepts a little

511
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,439
off

512
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
how many of you seen board presentations

513
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,679
with dashboards like this

514
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,559
oh

515
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,319
look at all the pretty vulnerability

516
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,319
colors

517
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,880
and wow we patched all those different

518
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
things that's a pretty donut chart donut

519
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,240
charts are horrible by the way

520
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
any of my accessibility experts in here

521
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
talk to them they'll tell you why donut

522
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
charts suck don't use donut charts

523
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
oh hey look at all that stuff we blocked

524
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,679
with our ddos filters

525
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
yeah that's exciting

526
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,640
you know when you find out how useless

527
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
these metrics are

528
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
when the board member or your ceo or

529
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
your cfo looks at you and says

530
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
yeah but what does that mean

531
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
yeah no kidding

532
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,320
these are great metrics we in the

533
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
security world know what they mean and

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,640
they're great

535
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
to anyone outside of security this is

536
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
completely without context it is

537
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
completely meaningless

538
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
it does nothing

539
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
to demonstrate that we're doing the

540
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,919
right things or that we're you know

541
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
protecting the business i mean they look

542
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
great you know

543
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
all right

544
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,240
yeah we we did all that stuff

545
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
is that good or bad what do our vendor

546
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,840
what do our competitors see

547
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,320
i don't know

548
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,280
yeah

549
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
well now your board is wondering like

550
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
how competent are you really

551
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
yeah yeah you gave us some pretty

552
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
pictures we like those pretty pictures

553
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
but

554
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,360
we gotta do more so metrics are great

555
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,640
and we'll come back to metrics too

556
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
because metrics can be a good thing they

557
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
are a necessary thing

558
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,799
but they need to be used in the right

559
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,880
way this one is a little more rare

560
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,679
in the wording okay i don't know that i

561
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,280
actually hear people say this too often

562
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
but this is the approach right so the

563
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
board needs to understand your projects

564
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,360
hey here's all the cool things i'm doing

565
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,039
i'm doing this i'm installing this i've

566
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,240
got all these different vendors we're

567
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
using this and we're using this and so

568
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
we just bought this new edr platform but

569
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,280
then we're going to move to xdr and we

570
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
bought this ddos and package and and by

571
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
the way uh so we had to deploy micro

572
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
segmentation and so we implemented this

573
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,480
tool and and now we're going to move to

574
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,679
this next-gen whatever whiz-bang

575
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,960
military-grade whatever

576
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
crazy vendor product we're going to

577
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,160
install next

578
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,440
and you know what your board members are

579
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
doing

580
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
they're looking at their phones

581
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
those are the kind of board meetings

582
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
i've sat through

583
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
i've watched technology people go in

584
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
there and talk for a half hour

585
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,080
about all the cool technologies

586
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
and the board members aren't even paying

587
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
attention anymore they're gone they're

588
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
out they're done they've seen it

589
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
they're not interested

590
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,840
because none of that means anything to

591
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
them

592
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
when you go in there and you say hey

593
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
we're deploying crowdstrike on all of

594
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,200
our

595
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,000
workstations

596
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,760
yeah so what does that mean

597
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,120
they don't know

598
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
they don't care they don't need to know

599
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,400
so telling them the what

600
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
that i'm doing all of this stuff i can

601
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,360
throw a bunch of logos on the screen

602
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,240
this doesn't tell them anything

603
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
we in security when we walk into these

604
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
high-level meetings

605
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
we are there

606
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
to give them the information that they

607
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
need

608
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,000
in order to make decisions

609
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
at the end of the day when i'm going to

610
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,120
the board i want them to have

611
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
to understand my view of our security

612
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
posture so they can make the decisions i

613
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
want them to make

614
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,000
so

615
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
in the spirit of the talk

616
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
in the spirit of being out here at

617
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,679
hacker summer camp

618
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,440
you know

619
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
i'm a lifelong hacker it's what i do

620
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,760
it's how i think about things

621
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,600
so

622
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
it's time to start thinking like a

623
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,159
hacker

624
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
there's got to be a better way

625
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
i want this system the system being my

626
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,559
executive and board leadership

627
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
to respond to me in the ways that i

628
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,400
would like

629
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
maybe not the ways that they're used to

630
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
maybe not the ways they're designed to

631
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,399
that's the reality

632
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
so

633
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,960
now i

634
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
if you read the uh the abstract for this

635
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
session today

636
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,320
i promised you some real world examples

637
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
then i changed jobs

638
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
so i can't really give you you'll notice

639
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,679
it's a little more redacted than i would

640
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,600
have liked but you know i i can't

641
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,880
leverage some of those things because i

642
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,039
don't work there anymore there's like

643
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,799
intellectual property

644
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,720
constraints there they get kind of

645
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
sensitive about that i i can't figure

646
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
out why

647
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,679
but we're gonna go through this and i'm

648
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,120
gonna we're gonna look at this from the

649
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,640
hacker's perspective

650
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,559
so put your hacker mindset on for me you

651
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,840
don't have to be a pen tester you don't

652
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,000
have to be a hacker but just

653
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,760
imagine looking at this problem the way

654
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
a pen tester or a hacker might look at

655
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,720
this

656
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,520
i want to manipulate my board

657
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
i want to win them over

658
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
i want to make them my friends

659
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
i want to make them stand up and say

660
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
i get it

661
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,720
how many people do you need on your team

662
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
how many do you have now let's get you

663
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
more

664
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
because that

665
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,559
is something else i've heard from a

666
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,720
board and that is gold

667
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
so let's dive into this

668
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
all right first and foremost if you are

669
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
going to any board or executive level

670
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,120
meeting

671
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
you need to assess the perimeter just

672
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,960
like you would if you were a hacker what

673
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,919
are you going to do you're going to go

674
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,640
out there you're going to do some

675
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
passive scanning you're going to be

676
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,679
really quiet and subtle about it

677
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
your board is no different get out there

678
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
understand who it is that you're going

679
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
to be talking to

680
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
and when i say understand don't just you

681
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
know okay well that's their name that's

682
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
her bio that's on a website or something

683
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
okay that's great

684
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
you know or hey yeah i know all my

685
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,960
executives i know who they are or i know

686
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
my senior leadership

687
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
look at their background

688
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,360
where do they come from

689
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,279
people don't end up in board leadership

690
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,480
positions

691
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
because they're you know

692
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
cyber security experts or they're

693
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
oblivious to running businesses these

694
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,080
are people who are running businesses

695
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
elsewhere they have a perspective on

696
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,039
things

697
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,320
and that's something you can use to your

698
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
advantage do they come from healthcare

699
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
if their day job is they're a ceo of a

700
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,200
healthcare company and they serve on the

701
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,559
board of your company that does

702
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
something completely different

703
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
use that to your advantage

704
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
they understand the concepts of privacy

705
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,520
because they're probably inundated with

706
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,200
hipaa talk all the time

707
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,039
so use that maybe you're not even in a

708
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,720
regulated industry at all but you can

709
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,240
use that context to talk to them and

710
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
help them understand it do they come

711
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,919
from financial services same thing they

712
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,679
understand pci regulations they

713
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,559
understand things like the sec

714
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,320
the occ

715
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
e-i-e-i-o we can go through them all

716
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
right all the regulators out there you

717
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
can leverage that information

718
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
have they worked in pharma maybe they

719
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
understand the complexities of being you

720
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
know going through compliance

721
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,960
all of these different things understand

722
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,559
where they come from because when you go

723
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,760
into there and you understand the

724
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,039
audience you're talking to those are

725
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,360
things that you're going to leverage

726
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,919
but you have to understand it so that

727
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,720
you can you can build that plan but

728
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
it's all about understanding where they

729
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
came from

730
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
because that is what's going to tell you

731
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,640
what are they thinking

732
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
knowing and being able to predict what

733
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
your board is thinking is crucially

734
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
important

735
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
because you want to plan your targets

736
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
all right just like if i'm in a pen test

737
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
i go out there i do first thing i do is

738
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,480
i do that reconnaissance right i kind of

739
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,360
assess the perimeter i figure out

740
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,440
where do i want to go first what looks

741
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
juicy what looks interesting

742
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
what do i need to be prepared for where

743
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,440
am i probably going to find some counter

744
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
measures that i'm going to need to evade

745
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
so i start to plan my targets

746
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
accordingly well it's the same thing

747
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
when i go in front of the board i want

748
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
to know

749
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,760
what is it that they want to know

750
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,640
they don't really want to know

751
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
how many

752
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,640
you know denial of service attacks we

753
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,159
blocked or how many ransomware emails we

754
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,240
caught in our email system

755
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
or

756
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,440
how many people clicked on the phishing

757
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,760
test

758
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
they asked those questions because

759
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
that's what they hear

760
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,760
they hear it in the industry they've

761
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,320
probably seen it in their own companies

762
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
they've probably heard it from your

763
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
predecessors or your peers and so

764
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
what are they really trying to assess

765
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,159
well they just want to know are we

766
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,200
secure

767
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,919
are we safe from being breached now that

768
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,440
question in and of itself might be

769
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
problematic to you it should be

770
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,640
because going back to that it's not if

771
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,000
but when yeah that's actually true

772
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
nobody wants to stand up there and say

773
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,240
yes we are ultimately secure and we

774
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
cannot be breached

775
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
i mean i would love to be able to say

776
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that but you couldn't pay me enough to

777
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
get me to say that

778
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,840
but that's what they're asking they

779
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
wanna say they're looking for that

780
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,919
comfort to say all right we're doing the

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,760
right things they also want to

782
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,679
understand are we spending the right

783
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,960
money in the right places

784
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
again their job is to make sure the

785
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
business is profitable whether we're

786
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
talking executives whether we're talking

787
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,480
board members they are there to make

788
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,279
sure the money looks good

789
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
so if they're spending money on cyber

790
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
security they want to know

791
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
that it is delivering as promised that

792
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,840
they're spending money in the right

793
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,880
places that at the end of the day

794
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
they're not going to be spending more

795
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
money

796
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
to clean up a breach

797
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
to do all the pr work

798
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
following a breach

799
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
to deal with the reputational impacts

800
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120
that believe it or not do actually

801
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,840
impact the business

802
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,039
and then finally they just want to know

803
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,159
ultimately should i be worried

804
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,520
what's out there that i need to be

805
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,799
worried about what are the things

806
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,880
you know if i've got a competency so

807
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
when i trust my cecil what's keeping

808
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
them up at night

809
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,860
what are they worried about

810
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,010
[Music]

811
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,480
oh my lord

812
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
we have a tradition here where the uh

813
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
speaker is allowed to make an outrageous

814
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
request

815
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
and we do our best to honor it although

816
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,520
sometimes we honor it in evil genie

817
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,679
fashion

818
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,880
we had a request for a crown and scepter

819
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
suitable for the duchess of hackington

820
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
would you say we have delivered

821
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
i would say you have most definitely

822
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,320
delivered please take your scepter

823
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
out

824
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,200
i appreciate it thank you so much i

825
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,399
think we'll keep this for the rest of

826
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,990
the presentation then

827
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,320
[Applause]

828
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
you know so

829
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,720
for those who i don't know if you caught

830
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
it at the beginning when you when you uh

831
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,480
send in a cfp submission to b-sides they

832
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,360
ask you for any outrageous crazy you

833
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,679
know requests allah like

834
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
a bowl full of brown m ms or whatever

835
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,840
right no other colors

836
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,080
so see there you go blue monkey

837
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,720
yeah i threw this out and i well i guess

838
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,399
i guess he delivered so

839
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
here we are now completely sidetracked

840
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,320
and i've completely lost my train of

841
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,760
thought

842
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,080
i love it all right so we're talking

843
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
about what the board really wants to

844
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,760
know ultimately they want that peace of

845
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
mind you know i shared that story with

846
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,919
you intentionally because you know that

847
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,360
board member said hey you know what

848
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,039
cyber security is keeping us up at night

849
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,039
it's the thing that we're worried about

850
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,320
but

851
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
you've given me comfort that i

852
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,559
understand that somebody is watching out

853
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,399
for us and they're doing the right

854
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,760
things

855
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,159
and that's what your board wants to hear

856
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,279
from you that's what they want to hear

857
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,840
from every leader that they talk to when

858
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,919
i t comes in there they want to hear are

859
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,279
you doing the right things from a

860
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,440
technology perspective to make sure that

861
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
we're staying competitive

862
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,000
are you doing the right things from a

863
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,919
risk management perspective to deal with

864
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,760
all that different business risk way

865
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,320
beyond cyber security and make sure that

866
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
we're doing the right things

867
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,600
when the business leaders come in are

868
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
you doing the right things to address

869
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
market conditions

870
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
so when they hear from cyber security

871
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
they want to know

872
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,559
at the end of the day

873
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,399
that we've got it in hand that we're

874
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
competent we know what we're doing

875
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,600
because that's their job

876
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
their job is oversight over the business

877
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,880
so keep that focus remember that when

878
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
you walk in there you're not there to

879
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,000
tell them about a bunch of stats that

880
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,640
don't mean anything

881
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
you're there to make them comfortable

882
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,039
you're there to make them feel like

883
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,600
you've got this in hand

884
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,559
you're also there to confidently explain

885
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,120
to them where there are deficiencies

886
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
that you need their help in getting

887
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,360
addressed

888
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,960
now

889
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,640
i mentioned that problematic

890
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,600
idea of are we secure enough

891
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,360
you'll also run into these questions

892
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,120
when you walk into these conversations

893
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,399
at those levels

894
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,480
so uh

895
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
when are we done spending on cyber

896
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,720
security or

897
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
when are we

898
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,200
when are we secure enough

899
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,039
those are questions i've gotten those

900
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,559
are questions i'm sure anybody who's

901
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,960
been in a board presentation has heard

902
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
i'm sure many of you may have even heard

903
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
those from scary enough your own cyber

904
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,840
security

905
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
leaders my answer is really simple

906
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,960
well

907
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,679
when

908
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,240
if technology stops evolving or we stop

909
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
adopting new technology and new business

910
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,200
lines

911
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,039
maybe we can kick back our feet a little

912
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,158
bit and chill on cyber security

913
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,600
not really true but the fact of the

914
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,440
matter is technology is never going to

915
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,399
stop

916
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,080
we're not going to stop innovating

917
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,760
because that would be the death of our

918
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,080
company

919
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,440
so we need to flip that narrative

920
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,120
we need to manipulate the inputs we're

921
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,960
providing to them if they ask us for

922
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,799
metrics and we go in and we hand them a

923
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,039
dashboard like you saw up there earlier

924
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,039
we're just playing into

925
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,960
that same narrative that allows them to

926
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
think that at some point there's an end

927
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,519
state to this

928
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,159
there's no end state

929
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,519
and if you're having a hard time

930
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
messaging this to them just point them

931
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,679
to that business concept hey you know

932
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,720
what

933
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,840
we don't stop investing in new business

934
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,720
we don't stop exploring new markets that

935
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,679
we can dive into

936
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,159
we don't stop

937
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,000
changing our technology footprint to

938
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
take advantage of

939
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,320
new technologies and new features that

940
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
will make us more profitable so why

941
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,679
would we do this why would we do that

942
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,159
with cyber security cyber security is a

943
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,559
part of your business too

944
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,279
it needs to keep evolving keep growing

945
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,880
and keep getting stronger and when you

946
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
put that in that context form

947
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,240
now it makes sense

948
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,360
because that's something they can

949
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
understand they understand the evolution

950
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,799
of business

951
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
how new markets are explored

952
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,440
and how that progresses so use that to

953
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
your advantage that's where knowing your

954
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,880
audience happens

955
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
now

956
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,399
one of the things

957
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,600
i remember from pen testing

958
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,919
my days when i did this

959
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,279
was how often pen testers

960
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,919
would lose sight of the big picture

961
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,519
even hackers

962
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,279
you'd get in there and you'd find

963
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,200
something juicy and like that this looks

964
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,120
really really cool i'm gonna dig into

965
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,000
that

966
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and you'd spend so much time on this one

967
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
little thing that you know looked like

968
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,120
it might have an exploit maybe it

969
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,799
finally successfully exploited only to

970
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,320
find out you know what

971
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
it didn't really get you anywhere

972
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,399
because you lost sight of the bigger

973
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,440
picture

974
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,600
you weren't looking at the whole

975
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,640
application or the whole network or

976
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
you weren't understanding the greater

977
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
context of what it was that you were

978
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
attacking in the first place you got so

979
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,679
hyper focused on the ones and zeros of

980
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,000
what came back from your nessus scan

981
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,239
or you know that error message you got

982
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,560
when you dumped a tick mark into a login

983
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,159
field and you got all excited because

984
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
who's sql error

985
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,839
yay sql injection yes yes yes

986
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,079
we do the same thing when we go in and

987
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,599
we talk about cyber security especially

988
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,679
when we get in and buried in those

989
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,440
metrics

990
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
we don't want to look at metrics on a

991
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,159
one-off it's great to say yeah you know

992
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,159
what

993
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,879
we closed 4 000 critical vulnerabilities

994
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,918
this month

995
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,319
hooray

996
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,280
so what does that mean

997
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,239
i don't know we we still have you know 2

998
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,079
000 open all right so you're telling me

999
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,280
you you

1000
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,918
you fixed 36 of them

1001
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,200
what about the other 33

1002
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:00,960
and at the end of the day it's

1003
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
meaningless why did we have 4 000

1004
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
vulnerabilities why did we have 6 000

1005
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,880
vulnerabilities that needed to be

1006
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
remediated in the first place where did

1007
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,599
they come from

1008
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,119
is that more or less than we had last

1009
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
month well i don't know well okay i'll

1010
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,400
go look at that i'll get you those

1011
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
numbers all right great

1012
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
did we do more releases did we do fewer

1013
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,119
releases how fast are we

1014
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,960
introducing releases and is that having

1015
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,800
a direct impact

1016
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
positively or negatively on our

1017
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,079
vulnerability accounts these are the

1018
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,160
kinds of questions they start to ask

1019
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,599
because they're natural questions

1020
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
especially for somebody who is you know

1021
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,560
used to the business numbers

1022
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,240
so they're going to ask those questions

1023
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
when you start to put those

1024
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,079
all those numbers in front of them

1025
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,320
without context the fact of the matter

1026
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,599
is when you're up there and you're

1027
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
telling them these things you're not up

1028
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,040
there to tell them the what

1029
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
so we think about the projects we think

1030
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
about our metrics we're not there to say

1031
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
this is what we're doing this is what we

1032
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
did it's not about the what it's about

1033
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
the why

1034
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,400
why did we roll out crowdstrike or

1035
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
carbon black or

1036
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
fender du jour because i don't want to

1037
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
pretend like i'm endorsing somebody here

1038
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,200
i'm really not

1039
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,320
why do we roll out that new mdr tool or

1040
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,040
edr tool

1041
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,680
explain to them that reasoning

1042
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,000
see the bigger picture and tell them why

1043
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,160
say you know what hey i'm looking at our

1044
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,079
overall cyber security posture right now

1045
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,160
and we're in this really reactive state

1046
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,599
which means we're doing a lot of really

1047
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,599
good things

1048
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,520
but it's taking away from the business

1049
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,880
because you know what we're having to

1050
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,119
react we're not being proactive we're

1051
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,920
not ahead of the game you know we we

1052
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,599
we've discovered vulnerabilities and

1053
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,599
then we close them but we're not doing

1054
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,040
the right things to reduce the number of

1055
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,320
vulnerabilities and you know what that's

1056
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,400
having impact on the business it means

1057
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
that our developers are spending more

1058
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,480
time fixing p1's out of their backlog

1059
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,240
than they're spending implementing new

1060
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
feature functionality

1061
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
now maybe you don't have to get quite

1062
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,680
that deep but they understand that idea

1063
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,320
of innovation is being slowed down

1064
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,720
because we're reactive i want to bring

1065
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,240
our cyber security program up to this

1066
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,960
next level i want to make us proactive

1067
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,280
because that's where we're sitting today

1068
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,400
at this reactive state

1069
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
now you're starting to show them where

1070
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,359
the business value is because oh

1071
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,960
alyssa's telling us she's going to make

1072
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
the business run better

1073
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,079
by improving our maturity in our cyber

1074
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,040
security program

1075
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,160
that starts to speak to the language of

1076
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,200
business

1077
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,640
the real language of business

1078
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,800
all right great so i got in front of the

1079
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,640
board i told them hey you know what this

1080
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,320
is what i want to do

1081
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,680
you know i want to get us from here to

1082
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,720
here i'm going to drive all this

1083
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
business value great

1084
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
but

1085
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,720
now what

1086
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,399
i want to make sure they invite me back

1087
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,280
because you know what that happens too

1088
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,800
csos get in front of the board and they

1089
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,520
bore the crap out of the board

1090
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,480
and they never get asked back

1091
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,880
or when they do the board is all set for

1092
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,359
them to be boring or

1093
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,920
doom and gloom and these are i mean i'm

1094
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
literally quoting studies and articles

1095
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,359
you can find out there if you want to go

1096
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,880
digging

1097
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,480
that's the way the board members often

1098
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,680
think of the cso is my god they're just

1099
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,200
they're always telling me how bad

1100
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,919
everything is

1101
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,440
so i want to give them a reason to

1102
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,720
invite me back so if i say hey

1103
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,680
you know what this is our current

1104
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,839
maturity this is where i want to get to

1105
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,359
here's the elements that are going to

1106
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,880
get us there and here's how we're going

1107
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,960
to get there so rather than throwing a

1108
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,280
bunch of you know here's here's my

1109
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,760
strategic program of 45 new initiatives

1110
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
that we're going to do in the next three

1111
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,280
years

1112
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,359
okay how did you pick those

1113
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,599
no give them the road map well hey you

1114
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,280
know what first we're going to implement

1115
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,839
this this new email security program

1116
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,839
then we're going to do some i don't know

1117
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,640
take your pic what uh maybe

1118
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
security awareness training

1119
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
and then on top of that we're going to

1120
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
do some micro segmentation and that's

1121
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,359
gonna move us from here to here in terms

1122
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,000
of our maturity for defending against

1123
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,320
uh phishing attacks that drive malware

1124
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,040
and ransomware

1125
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,359
malware ransomware they know those words

1126
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,720
they hear those in the media

1127
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,359
you just gave them three initiatives for

1128
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,280
them to invest in that are gonna that

1129
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
tell them hey this is how that scary

1130
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,640
thing you're hearing about in the media

1131
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,560
with colonial pipeline getting breached

1132
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,800
or whoever else this is how i'm fixing

1133
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,119
that for you i have a plan this is how

1134
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,320
i'm going to get there

1135
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,680
they're comfortable because they feel

1136
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
like you have it in hand they want you

1137
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,040
to keep coming back and telling them

1138
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,880
how's that going

1139
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,560
and

1140
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,839
they want to invest in that because

1141
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,960
you're speaking to something that

1142
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,320
they're hearing every day

1143
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
road maps are a buzzword

1144
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,160
okay

1145
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
for many of those folks out there in the

1146
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
cyber security world who just want to

1147
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
focus on the tech when we hear road maps

1148
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,359
we cringe because it is a buzzword that

1149
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,520
gets used a lot but they are actually

1150
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
important

1151
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
this is the context where they are

1152
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,160
important

1153
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,000
this is what a road map needs to be

1154
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
to build off of this i told you a story

1155
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
before that i there was a cso who got in

1156
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
my opinion now this is just my opinion i

1157
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,599
think this cecil got fired

1158
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,760
in part in part not

1159
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
alone

1160
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
because he failed to embrace this when

1161
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,839
he went in to make the most of a crisis

1162
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,839
company gets breached

1163
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,800
c so it had a three-year strategic

1164
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,880
program lined up

1165
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
you know he was doing all these

1166
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,079
different things but they were all just

1167
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,680
it was literally the laundry list of

1168
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,520
initiatives and so when the company got

1169
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,359
breached now

1170
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,560
they got breached but they didn't have

1171
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,160
any real

1172
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,400
like material impact as they would refer

1173
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,640
to it because well you know nothing

1174
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
ultimately ended up getting exposed

1175
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,720
they caught it fairly early

1176
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,079
you know they had to do some things it

1177
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,920
was a little bit impactful but they

1178
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,440
stopped it

1179
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,599
so what does he do well never let a good

1180
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,880
crisis go to waste he goes in front of

1181
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,960
the board and says hey here's all the

1182
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,640
things we found that we need to improve

1183
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
because of this crisis that we had

1184
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,760
you know what the board asked them the

1185
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,040
first thing

1186
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,720
how many of those items were in your

1187
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
strategic vision or in your strategic

1188
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,839
plan

1189
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,400
oh none

1190
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
what did you just tell the board

1191
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,480
you spent all that money you invested

1192
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
all that stuff in in me and the things i

1193
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,680
told you we need to do and none of it

1194
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,359
had any impact

1195
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,800
because what he didn't do is he didn't

1196
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,040
go in there and focus on the things that

1197
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,720
were positive well how were you able to

1198
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
detect it oh yeah because you know that

1199
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,520
mdr tool or that edr tool we invested in

1200
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,839
hey it actually alerted and we saw it

1201
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
quickly you know that micro segmentation

1202
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,400
we invested in we were able to shut off

1203
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,319
access across the network to limit the

1204
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,079
scope of where that ransomware got to

1205
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,000
so when we talk about

1206
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,839
you know not letting a good crisis go to

1207
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,440
waste

1208
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,280
use that crisis to reinforce how the

1209
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,040
things that you have done

1210
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,960
worked how the controls that you did

1211
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,920
have in place helped even if ultimately

1212
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,400
you got breached and man you know what

1213
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,040
they shut us down for a week

1214
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,880
at least talk about where are those

1215
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,280
bright spots what went well what

1216
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,960
elements do you have in place to build

1217
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,880
on where was there something positive

1218
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,079
because otherwise at the end of the day

1219
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,880
you just look incompetent

1220
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
and i'm convinced with this see so that

1221
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
that is part of what drove him out of

1222
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,160
this organization

1223
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,000
because you can't go in there and and

1224
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,480
talk to the board like that after a high

1225
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,200
level breach

1226
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,880
and basically tell them that nothing

1227
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,400
that you've done in the last three years

1228
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,319
in your millions of dollar program

1229
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,119
actually helped

1230
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,520
and then finally we need to prioritize

1231
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,640
so going back to the thing about the

1232
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,480
hackers mindset one more time when i'm

1233
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
looking at exploits i'm prioritizing for

1234
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,160
impact

1235
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,920
i need to do the same when i'm thinking

1236
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,319
about how i'm going to enable a business

1237
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,680
now if i really actually want to enable

1238
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,160
the business good is if i can show some

1239
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
cost savings i'm putting in an imp and

1240
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,480
implementing something that's going to

1241
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
save us cost it's going to make it

1242
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,760
easier for us we're going to be more

1243
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,480
efficient great

1244
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,800
better though is if i can show how my

1245
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
item my

1246
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
my new initiative is going to let us

1247
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
tackle a wish list item

1248
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,599
all right that's wonderful

1249
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,640
because now

1250
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,040
every it organization every technology

1251
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,160
organization in the world has those

1252
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
wishlist items they can't get to a great

1253
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,599
example of this i did in one

1254
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,079
organization you know what a four minute

1255
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,520
i keep talking about edr i don't know

1256
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,680
why

1257
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,520
but that just keeps coming up i'm sorry

1258
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,040
i don't know why i'm so focused on edr

1259
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,800
today that's really bad

1260
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
but no we we put in an edr solution and

1261
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,720
one of the things we looked at to get to

1262
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,640
justify it was hey

1263
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,400
you know i t what's what's frustrating

1264
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,839
you the most or where are you spending

1265
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,960
most your time where do you see an

1266
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,280
inefficiency and it was rebuilding

1267
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
machines that were getting infected with

1268
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
malware now this was you know five years

1269
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,880
ago

1270
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,800
well hey if we put this edr solution and

1271
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,079
we're able to block that malware that

1272
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,599
should free up your help desk people so

1273
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,359
they're not rebuilding computers all the

1274
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,599
time and they can do other things

1275
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,119
and indeed they were actually able to do

1276
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,880
that they were able to invest in a

1277
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,440
wishlist item that they had for uh

1278
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,680
deploying virtual uh

1279
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,640
i think it was aws virtual workstations

1280
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,839
because now they had the time to

1281
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,960
dedicate to it because they weren't

1282
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,880
sitting there dealing with you know

1283
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,800
having to rebuild these physical laptops

1284
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,760
all the time because we're blocking that

1285
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
the best is if you can show them how

1286
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
your initiative enables a new market

1287
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
hey you know what we rolled out that i

1288
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,040
am solution so that means that product

1289
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
that we're selling yeah we can leverage

1290
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,720
that same im solution so we can federate

1291
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,960
authentication to your application

1292
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
to the customers so they can integrate

1293
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,119
with it with sso they're not dependent

1294
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,520
on us anymore they can implement all of

1295
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,440
the things that they want to from their

1296
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
side their access reviews everything

1297
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
else happened from their end they're

1298
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,119
happy look that's something new that

1299
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,680
makes your customers happy

1300
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,920
that shows you understand the business

1301
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,319
and how your cyber security initiative

1302
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,119
can play into that that is absolute

1303
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,680
solid gold when you go in front of

1304
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,240
anybody from the business side with a

1305
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,280
cyber security initiative

1306
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,400
so

1307
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
last two slides

1308
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,660
yeah i'm counting slides wow um

1309
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,160
[Music]

1310
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,240
so you get invited to go present to your

1311
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,000
elt your executive leadership team or

1312
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,680
the board

1313
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,200
what do you need to do

1314
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,440
my suggestion three slides if you're

1315
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,280
making a presentation for the board

1316
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,960
don't plan on presenting more than three

1317
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,920
slides

1318
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,200
now you can have more slides that go

1319
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,359
into an appendix that have a bunch of

1320
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,400
metrics and other things but

1321
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,240
focus on three slides

1322
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,839
three things you should be giving them

1323
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,839
ah i took it off the screen

1324
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,920
talk about what's happened what's

1325
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,680
happened since the last time you met

1326
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,880
give them that update they're all gonna

1327
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,319
want that

1328
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,720
then tell them where we are

1329
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,400
these are the risks i'm seeing right now

1330
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,280
these are the three or four top risks

1331
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,520
that i'm focused on almost every board

1332
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,680
and every elt they're going to ask you

1333
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,000
this they want to understand what's the

1334
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,160
top risk right now russia's going

1335
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,880
bonkers in ukraine does that matter to

1336
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,440
us maybe it does maybe it doesn't

1337
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,280
ransomware i'm hearing all about that do

1338
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,000
we care about that yes we do

1339
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,520
put that in front of them and then

1340
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,480
finally

1341
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,520
tell them what you're going to do about

1342
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,720
it tell them the why tell them the story

1343
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,000
of hey you know what we saw this

1344
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
here's what i'm worried about right now

1345
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,520
here's what we're going to fix to make

1346
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,839
sure that that's less of a risk for

1347
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,119
us finally when you go into a board

1348
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,040
meeting some things to be aware of first

1349
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,200
and foremost

1350
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,040
watch your time

1351
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
get the most important stuff that you

1352
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,680
can out as quickly as possible because

1353
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,440
you know what

1354
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,040
just like kanye they are going to

1355
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,680
interrupt you

1356
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,520
they are absolutely going to interrupt

1357
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,319
you

1358
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,280
and

1359
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,760
because these are people who are used to

1360
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,680
they're moving at the speed of light

1361
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,920
just like we all are and they may seem

1362
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,599
rude but it's the way that they behave

1363
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,960
they will interrupt you in the middle of

1364
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,559
your session so get the most important

1365
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,079
stuff in front of them how do they

1366
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,119
interrupt you well they are going to

1367
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,880
come with every question imaginable and

1368
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,319
some of these questions are going to be

1369
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,359
wild

1370
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,040
you're going to say hey you know what

1371
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
yeah we've been working with cisa to

1372
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,480
understand all these emerging threats

1373
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,400
and what we should be doing and you know

1374
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,160
what attacks are being exploited and

1375
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,599
then they'll say something like well are

1376
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,359
you working with the nsa and darpa on

1377
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,759
that too

1378
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,559
we're not a defense contractor

1379
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,400
we're not international so i'm not

1380
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,960
really sure that nsa and darpa have much

1381
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,200
applicability here but those are the

1382
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,400
kinds of questions they're going to ask

1383
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,000
because they hear their peers talking

1384
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,040
about it

1385
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,839
okay so you want to be prepared to

1386
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,839
answer those questions that sometimes

1387
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,280
are just not going to make any sense at

1388
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,960
all

1389
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,400
you can't know every question they're

1390
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
going to ask but be prepared to handle

1391
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,720
that on the fly because they will stop

1392
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,800
you and they will ask some really

1393
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,760
interesting questions

1394
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,839
at the end of the day you're up there to

1395
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,359
educate them

1396
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,040
you're there to make sure that they

1397
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,760
understand the cyber security posture of

1398
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,520
your organization so they can make

1399
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
decisions

1400
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,359
just remember this quote from einstein

1401
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,800
genius is making

1402
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,559
complex ideas simple don't go the other

1403
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,839
direction

1404
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,079
don't make simple stuff complex enough

1405
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,119
of this as complex as it is

1406
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,599
so the magic slide i always always

1407
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,200
invite you to continue the conversation

1408
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,440
if you've got questions or you think i'm

1409
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,000
full of crap tell me in a nice way if

1410
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,559
you wouldn't mind that'd be best but i'm

1411
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,119
more likely to respond if you do

1412
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,559
but please reach out to me on social

1413
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,440
media and then finally big big thank you

1414
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,000
to b-sides for

1415
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,520
the crown and the scepter and having me

1416
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,520
up here i mean this is great

1417
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,200
thank you to my organization for you

1418
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,880
know letting me be up here and talk

1419
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,400
about working for them and you know

1420
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,040
giving me some time to get away from

1421
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,960
all the craziness going on there and

1422
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,079
thank you to all you for being here

1423
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,319
so the big question now is do we have

1424
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,558
any questions

1425
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,920
have i ever seen a board fire a ceo

1426
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,400
because of a presentation from the cso

1427
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,160
not directly

1428
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,280
however i have seen hard questions asked

1429
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,520
when a cso went and made a really poor

1430
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,200
presentation

1431
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,920
where the ceo is now getting asked or

1432
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,680
sometimes you know the cto or the cro

1433
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,400
depending on who that cso reports into

1434
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,160
they'll get some pretty hard questions

1435
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,880
if a ceo if a sissel walks into

1436
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,599
a board meeting and really drops drops

1437
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:18,480
the ball

1438
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,240
yeah i've seen hard questions come from

1439
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,040
that

1440
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,359
and i'm sure sometimes that

1441
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,720
you know

1442
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
ceo role is just as tenuous as any other

1443
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,558
when you're in front of the board so

1444
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
yeah

1445
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,720
see now we're getting ready for hot

1446
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,800
takes who do i think the c t or who

1447
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,240
should the c cell report to

1448
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,400
so here comes the fence writing answer

1449
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,079
of it depends

1450
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,280
um

1451
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,920
i think it can work in a number of ways

1452
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,760
you know ideally i would love to see the

1453
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,280
day where we get to cso's reporting

1454
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,640
directly the ceo or the cfo

1455
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,520
businesses aren't ready for that

1456
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
it can work with the cso reporting to

1457
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,359
the cio ask me how i know

1458
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,400
all right it can you can have cios who

1459
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,640
are or ctos who are very into this and

1460
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,319
very much appreciate it and will give

1461
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,160
the space but that has to be a working

1462
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,240
relationship that works and generally

1463
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,400
that works best if it's a technology

1464
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,160
driven company

1465
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,440
if you're in an industry it's not

1466
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,040
technology driven that doesn't work so

1467
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,839
well

1468
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,119
that's where you might want to look at

1469
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,559
something like maybe

1470
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,680
reporting into risk or reporting into

1471
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,280
their sa audit

1472
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,520
um not the greatest either

1473
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,839
but because no matter where they report

1474
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,240
honestly other than to the ceo there's

1475
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,599
always going to be that potential for

1476
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,200
conflict of interest

1477
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,880
you know and and so

1478
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,040
yeah there's not one magical answer i

1479
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,480
can say

1480
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,240
i've seen it work and i've seen it fail

1481
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,440
in all particular configurations so

1482
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,280
you know take that for what it's worth i

1483
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,040
wish i had a more definitive answer but

1484
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,240
i don't

1485
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,558
last one

1486
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,440
what would be my advice to handle the

1487
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,559
most unexpected question

1488
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,200
this is a lesson to learn for all of

1489
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,720
life right it's

1490
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,000
well that's a really good question

1491
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,599
start there because that gives you a few

1492
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,040
minutes to figure out how you're gonna

1493
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,240
answer i'll tell you the way not to

1494
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,760
answer is that's a really good question

1495
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,079
are you freaking nuts

1496
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,240
um you know but what it does do is it

1497
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,160
gives you a second to say or you know

1498
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,000
that's a really interesting idea you

1499
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,680
know i mean you want to be complimentary

1500
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,599
but i mean sometimes you do just have to

1501
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,440
be direct and and point out to them why

1502
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
it's not you know that that darpa

1503
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,280
question that's actually when i fielded

1504
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,400
okay she asked

1505
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,559
this board member asked me

1506
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,680
if i was working with darpa and i'm like

1507
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,520
so my answer to her was

1508
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,760
that's an interesting idea

1509
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
you know in our space we're really not

1510
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,920
you know working with dod or with the

1511
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,000
military or you know we're not even a

1512
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,599
federal contractor

1513
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,800
so

1514
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,839
you know

1515
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,839
we get more applicable information out

1516
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,760
of sisa than we would get out of darpa

1517
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,440
it's kind of the way i approached it and

1518
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,680
so you know it's a way of saying like

1519
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,520
yeah that's you know there's legitimacy

1520
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,720
because clearly she had heard that

1521
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,520
somewhere she had up here who said you

1522
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,240
know

1523
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,760
we work with darpa and get all this in

1524
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,559
yeah

1525
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,640
no we work with sisa because they're the

1526
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,319
ones that are focused on private sector

1527
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,359
and really trying to build that

1528
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,559
relationship

1529
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,559
so

1530
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,079
all right well i think we are out of

1531
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,160
time so thank you so much everybody i

1532
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,960
really appreciate it

1533
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:42,160
[Applause]
