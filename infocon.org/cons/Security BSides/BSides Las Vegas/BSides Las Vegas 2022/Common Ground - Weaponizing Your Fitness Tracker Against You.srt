[Music]

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,199
okay

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
hi everyone uh you can all hear me

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
cool so i'm going to give a talk that i

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,680
proposed in

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
uh in may of this year and i was like

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,360
hopefully this is going to be completely

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,439
irrelevant it'll just be like a cool

37
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
little you know interesting on the side

38
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,320
um

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,759
as everybody's aware that it's not

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,439
actually a situation um so i am

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
or sorry there's been a lot of um

42
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,040
attention paid to this sort of stuff

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
when like people are all of a sudden

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
realizing like that rights that we

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
thought were pretty well established and

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,759
our privacy is not

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,240
uh as sacristan as we had thought and so

48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
i am

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
a fitness tracker user i had a fitbit in

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
2010 um i still wear an apple watch i

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
have a peloton bike i have a scale at

52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,399
home that talks to wi-fi i've got a

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,840
bunch of examples in here for my own

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
personal data

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
and i'm a cso at a startup in the

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
healthcare space i know a ton about

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,399
hipaa probably far more about hipaa than

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,840
i would ever want to know

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
and i've done some threat models of

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
fitness trackers and so forth over the

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
years

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
looking at sort of privacy impacts and

63
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
so forth

64
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,759
and so

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,880
this talk is going to go through a lot

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
of things you're going to hear me talk a

67
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,920
bunch about

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
data that fitness trackers and so forth

69
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,878
collect

70
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,479
and one thing i'm going to actually talk

71
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
a lot about is that this talk is

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
somewhat irrelevant

73
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,000
uh law enforcement is not actually yet

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
using a lot of this data it's so

75
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
important that we realize what gets

76
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
collected and what the protections are

77
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,879
but this has not really been used in any

78
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,640
prosecution so far this talk is a little

79
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
bit more speculative and to inform

80
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
people and to have you think about

81
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
things

82
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
i am a lawyer i am not your lawyer but i

83
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,200
do want you to take one piece of advice

84
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
away from this which is

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
do not ever consent to the search of a

86
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,200
phone or a computer or anything anytime

87
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
you are pulled over by police or so

88
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
forth the one thing you say is i want uh

89
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,640
to talk to my attorney i do not consent

90
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,000
to the search of this car i do not

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
consent to the search of this phone

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
and so as i mentioned

93
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
we're going to talk a lot about all the

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
very personal data that you know your

95
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
apple watch and so forth collect

96
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
and it's still not really being used

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
this obviously could change things are

98
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,280
very fast moving

99
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,720
i've had to change this talk a couple

100
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,239
times over the last two days because of

101
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
things that are happening

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
but so far it's been all text messages

103
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
and searches and so forth

104
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,200
so

105
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,959
i'm going to do a very little bit on

106
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
this i actually did a talk at b-sides in

107
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
2018 where i went very deep into how

108
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
warrants work how wiretaps work

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
how prtts work and so if you're

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,400
interested in this

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,640
please go find that talk happy to answer

112
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
questions about it if you go watch it

113
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
and email me or so forth but i'll just

114
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
give you a little bit of a flavor of

115
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,519
what this is

116
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
when police are going after the search

117
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,359
history and text messages and so forth

118
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
so a subpoena is one of the

119
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
lowest burdens of proof essentially

120
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,159
um but it doesn't give you as much

121
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
information it gives you metadata

122
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,519
the fourth amendment

123
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,040
obviously is written in colonial times

124
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,799
and so they thought about this is like

125
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
well it's not that private the

126
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,159
addressing information on the outside of

127
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,280
an envelope

128
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
everybody can see it and so if you just

129
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,519
want to get to and from

130
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,959
information like we shouldn't need that

131
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,959
high of a burden of proof um obviously

132
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
anybody who studies stuff like

133
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
world war ii with the enigma and so

134
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,400
forth you can see that network analysis

135
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
and so forth will actually give you a

136
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,959
ton of information but we also have

137
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,040
computers now to help us with that

138
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
but generally subpoena is a lower

139
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,798
standard less information less privacy

140
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
protection

141
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
warrants

142
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,160
give you full content and so there's a

143
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
higher burden for that these are mostly

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
what are used if someone's going to get

145
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
text messages and so forth

146
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
and you need to show probable cause that

147
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
a crime has been committed in order to

148
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
get this full content data

149
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
related to that uh

150
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
law enforcement has started realizing

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,240
there's all this cool new tech out there

152
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
with all this juicy information that

153
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
they could get so they've started using

154
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
uh keyword warrants which are very

155
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
problematic from a civil liberties

156
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,120
standpoint you're not starting with a

157
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
person you're saying

158
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
i want to find everybody who googled for

159
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
um like this abortion drug i want to

160
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
find everybody who googled for abortion

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,560
clinics in a certain state

162
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
and so you're basically fishing for your

163
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
suspects

164
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
i am going to tweet out my slides so

165
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,560
there's a lot of urls and links in here

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,520
um

167
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
i am at 1dck on twitter so you can find

168
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
the slides after so if you want to feel

169
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,479
free to take pictures of the slides up

170
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,400
here but i will tweet them

171
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
and geofence warrants are also

172
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
very problematic um these are somewhat

173
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
similar to the cell site location

174
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
information warrants

175
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
the police have done giving everybody

176
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
that connected to a particular cell

177
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,320
tower

178
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,919
um so sometimes they're pulling it from

179
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
that sometimes they're asking google for

180
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
people who are in a certain area these

181
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
were used a lot in the january 6

182
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
prosecution who connected to certain

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,639
wi-fi

184
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,160
endpoints within the capitol building

185
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
and so forth

186
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
also problematic from a civil liberties

187
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,199
standpoint because you're not starting

188
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
with a suspect

189
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
you're like let me throw out a digital

190
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,000
uh fishing net and see what sort of

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,360
suspects might come up in it

192
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
and wiretaps which is what i have the

193
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
most legal experience with um

194
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
are very similar to warrants

195
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
for stored content and that you get the

196
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
full content from them

197
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
um the federal wiretap statutes say

198
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
wiretaps can only be used for certain

199
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
crimes if you go look that up it's a

200
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
huge laundry list of crimes there's a

201
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
lot in there

202
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
and de-orders there's something else

203
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
that i have a ton of experience with

204
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
this is basically subscriber information

205
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
so you can say

206
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
you know i'm going to do a subpoena to

207
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,680
get

208
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
it to and from for my communication and

209
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
i'm going to do a de-order for the

210
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
subscriber information from that and

211
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
basically they will do hops along a

212
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
network to see who's talking to who and

213
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
who these people actually are

214
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
google is one of the companies that

215
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
tries to be pretty open about what sort

216
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
of data they provide

217
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
you can go to the google transparency

218
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
report center and they tell you for all

219
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
these various types of

220
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,479
law enforcement orders that i just

221
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
walked through exactly what sort of

222
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,599
information they're going to hand over

223
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
uh all of that is kind of cool

224
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,120
i'm a bit of a wiretap nerd because i

225
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
worked on them and whatever i gotta say

226
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,360
a lot of what's happening has nothing to

227
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
do with wiretaps they don't take the

228
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,039
time to get warrants uh they capture

229
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
cell phones and they ask for permission

230
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
to search the cell phone and then they

231
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
take your cell phone um and do a

232
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
forensic analysis on it

233
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
there's

234
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,759
a lot of tools out there that will

235
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
basically take phones and extract

236
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,840
text

237
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
messages extract your location history

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
i am not an expert on this stuff there's

239
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,319
a lot of people around who are

240
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
my friend

241
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
rihanna wrote a really great

242
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
bed in the hill recently talking about

243
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
how the federal government really wants

244
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,599
to be serious about helping to protect

245
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,039
women

246
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,160
they could say that federal law

247
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
enforcement will not help with these

248
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,479
cell phone

249
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
digital forensics searches because right

250
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,520
now this is pretty much

251
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,479
happening and so as i mentioned um

252
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,840
people will they will get the cell

253
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
phones and ask for consent to search it

254
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
um and so consent bypasses all the

255
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
probable cause and other protections

256
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
that are in place for warrants and

257
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,360
wiretaps and so forth so very much do

258
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
not ever consent to a search of a device

259
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,240
even if you are positive you are

260
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
innocent just do not consent

261
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
okay so i promise we're going to talk

262
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,039
about fitness trackers and i've just

263
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,639
been talking to you about warrants and

264
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
keywords and so forth

265
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,000
so anytime we talk about fitness

266
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
trackers and health people go well

267
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
the us has vertical sector privacy

268
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
um and health is actually one of the

269
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
areas where we have a vertical sector of

270
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
privacy law called hipaa um hipaa does

271
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
not stand for like health information

272
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,519
privacy or whatever it stands for health

273
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
information sorry health insurance

274
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
portability and accountability act

275
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
originally had nothing really to do with

276
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
privacy there have been some add-ons

277
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,000
with high-tech and so forth so i'm going

278
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
to go very lightly over this

279
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
it protects information that originates

280
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
from doctors from hospitals from

281
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
insurance companies and so forth

282
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
it imposes some very minimal security

283
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
requirements so i tell my dev team you

284
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,040
know we need to do this for hipaa but we

285
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
really need to do this to be secure like

286
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
the hipaa requirements are pretty low

287
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
key

288
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
it has a bunch of administrative and

289
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,920
technical safeguards in place like your

290
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,959
stuff has to be encrypted

291
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
oh dear

292
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,800
so we had a uh outrageous speaker

293
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
request for all the hugs

294
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,720
so we formed a hog squad oh amazing

295
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
ready

296
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,560
thanks god everybody

297
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,230
[Music]

298
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
talking about hipaa and getting a hub

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,040
squad is maybe the bestest

300
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,079
cool so why does all this matter um what

301
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
use is hipaa

302
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,320
hipaa really is uh to protect your

303
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
health information so that if you work

304
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
at a hospital and you have access to

305
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
medical records

306
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
you can't just go splunking through the

307
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,279
medical records to see

308
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,720
you know does my neighbor have a

309
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
particular disease

310
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
why was a celebrity in the hospital you

311
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
can only access hipaa

312
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
protected and from health information if

313
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
you're authorized to access it aka

314
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
providing care so forth

315
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,320
there are a ton of exceptions in there

316
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
around law enforcement though

317
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
so since we just talked about warrants

318
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
and wiretaps we'll go quickly through

319
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
some of these

320
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
these are all on the hhs website if you

321
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,360
want to go

322
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
look at them in more detail

323
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
so you can just get a subpoena for this

324
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,839
information like we talked about

325
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
um to identify or locate a fugitive

326
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
uh

327
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
to basically uh

328
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
give over information about a victim of

329
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,839
a crime to help prosecute it

330
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,760
uh to alert law enforcement that maybe

331
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
someone was assaulted and they've died

332
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
and so now it's a murder suspect or

333
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
murder investigation

334
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,839
um in good faith if you think a crime

335
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,120
has occurred at the hospital

336
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
there's also a huge exception for like

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
protecting the president um so someone

338
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,240
goes to

339
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
a doctor and says i want to shoot the

340
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
president um they're allowed to go alert

341
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
secret service that sort of stuff

342
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
and hhs has recently released some

343
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
guidance around disclosures around

344
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
reproductive care

345
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,519
essentially says if you're a nurse and

346
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
you suspect someone had

347
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,880
a

348
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
miscarriage as suspicious

349
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
you can't just on your own go and report

350
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
this to the police

351
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
however there is still all the law

352
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
enforcement exceptions in place so it is

353
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,680
still valid under hipaa um

354
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
for basically law enforcement to send a

355
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200
warrant to a hospital to ask for

356
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
information if they think it's a crime

357
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
in that area

358
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
so is all our fitness tracker data like

359
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
the fitbit and the apple watch or

360
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
whatever protected by this great set of

361
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
protections

362
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,160
no

363
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,279
basically

364
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,880
fitness tracker information is created

365
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
by us and we are not covered entities

366
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,720
and so therefore hipaa is pretty much

367
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,040
off to the side um so it's a nice

368
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,720
vertical

369
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
sector privacy law that gives some

370
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
safeguards do not apply to fitness

371
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,720
tracker data almost always are there

372
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
some exceptions like if you have a

373
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,519
pacemaker

374
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,200
um or you're wearing an insulin pump or

375
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
something

376
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
at the like under a doctor's otters the

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
information from that is still under

378
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,320
hipaa but not your fitbit or your apple

379
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
watch

380
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,279
so what is a fitness tracker these days

381
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,160
like we say oh you know a fitbit

382
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
that certainly one that's sort of the

383
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
classic fitness tracker

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,160
my watch tracks you know oxygen

385
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,120
saturation my heartbeat and so forth

386
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,800
uh my phone if you keep your phone in

387
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,160
your pocket while you're walking around

388
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,519
it will keep track of like how often are

389
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,519
both your feet on the ground um how fast

390
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,000
you go up and down stairs

391
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,399
i have this scale at home and it reports

392
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
all sorts of stuff up into the cloud for

393
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
me

394
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,000
i have a peloton because i also stopped

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
going to the gym during the pandemic and

396
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
i have one of these and it talks to

397
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,200
apple health and google fit

398
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
so the fitness trackers know a lot about

399
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
uh you know body attributes about us

400
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
it's our heart rate and so forth they

401
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
also know some other stuff that law

402
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,880
enforcement might be interested in

403
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
where you were is a really big one

404
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,880
and so this is not actually an example

405
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
from a fitness tracker but i thought

406
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
this was like a nice tweet that sort of

407
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
summed up

408
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
this is from the recent thing where the

409
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,360
tim hortons app in canada got in trouble

410
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,199
for tracking when people were

411
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
coming and going from work and from home

412
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,240
and so this is a sort of information

413
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
that's just available on your phone if

414
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
you have an app and you've given the

415
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
application

416
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,000
access

417
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
there's also a really famous example in

418
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
this area of strava leaking the private

419
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,519
military bases um people

420
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,600
would scroll around on the map and be

421
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,440
looking these really empty desolate

422
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,519
areas in the middle east and go why is

423
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
there like a little square with a whole

424
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,959
bunch of people running and it turns out

425
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,440
those are secret forces bases

426
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,120
and they absolutely did not intend to do

427
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,199
this uh you know they're very smart

428
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,680
people but they're not you know

429
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,279
engineers and they didn't maybe notice

430
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,600
that this stuff was by default public

431
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
uh one that was very disturbing to me is

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
one that just came out somewhat recently

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,959
um

434
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,519
strava's flyby they're like well okay

435
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,720
part of the problem with leaking the

436
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,079
military bases was that you could see

437
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
stuff that wasn't close to you so

438
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
we'll make sure that all the location

439
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,839
stuff is near you so if you run past

440
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,199
someone maybe you want to find out what

441
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,639
the running route is

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,240
it turns out a lot of people start and

443
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,079
end their runs at their home

444
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
so you could find someone's home address

445
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
by running near them

446
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
they didn't really learn anything from

447
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,399
all of this they made some default

448
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,639
privacy changes uh say you know you'd

449
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
have to upload runs nearby

450
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
this is from june i just

451
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
you know had to pull this after i

452
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
submitted this talk because you can

453
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
upload completely fake fitness data

454
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
into strava showing like completely

455
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,199
unreasonable times and it will show you

456
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,800
running routes near you and someone used

457
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
it to discover a bunch of secret

458
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
military sites in israel

459
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
so location stuff can be very sensitive

460
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
if you don't think carefully about how

461
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
it can be abused

462
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
apple health also tracks location

463
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
they're a little bit more privacy

464
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,040
protective this is from a walk i did

465
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
near my house and you can see there is a

466
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,519
map

467
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,040
there's not really any way for me to

468
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,399
share that map publicly

469
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
so it's in my apple health uh if you use

470
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,759
peloton and you do outside walks with

471
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
them they have maps and they will allow

472
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
you to share it publicly so it sort of

473
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
go through there

474
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
but that's not by default public so it's

475
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
a little better

476
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
but the information is still there if

477
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
law enforcement excuse me wanted to

478
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,040
submit a warrant for it

479
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
and find this tracker stuff is super

480
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,519
uh common for people wanting to track

481
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,800
their bike routes and their running

482
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,079
routes and so forth and so there's a lot

483
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,040
of stuff

484
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
on the websites

485
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
for these tools that explain to you how

486
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
to turn it on how do i use this to track

487
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,880
things

488
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,360
so in addition to the gps as we

489
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,839
mentioned there's a lot of private

490
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
health information

491
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
about people's bodies that these

492
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,240
trackers have and that they store

493
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,320
one very interesting fitness tracker is

494
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
the aura ring and they have a

495
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
temperature sensor in them

496
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
i will

497
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
i'm sure most of the women in this room

498
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
know this but for the guys your body

499
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
temperature changes when you ovulate

500
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
and so body temperature actually can be

501
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920
a very good indicator of fertility

502
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,279
are you pregnant are you not it's

503
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,480
different for every woman but overall

504
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
and so when i was talking about this

505
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,800
with some friends they're like oh but

506
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
aura sure the tracking your temperature

507
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
but you have to very carefully take your

508
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,519
temperature if you're trying to get

509
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,360
pregnant it's probably not accurate

510
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
enough it's not really a real risk

511
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,359
so era is like oh no here's how you can

512
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,599
use it to track if you're ovulating

513
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
uh let us tell you how you do it

514
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
let us even give you some scientific

515
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
studies to show exactly how precise it

516
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,039
is um

517
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,720
so as i said i don't think anybody's

518
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
actually using this in court so far but

519
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
if you wanted to bring this evidence in

520
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,919
or is going to help you authenticate

521
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,439
that data to show

522
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,799
possibly that someone actually was

523
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,000
ovulating

524
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
stopped ovulating therefore maybe was

525
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,919
pregnant

526
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
uh so in addition to just things like

527
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,919
aura trying to guess if you're ovulating

528
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,760
or not because uh of your body

529
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,799
temperature

530
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,480
there's a ton

531
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
of support in these apps for cycle

532
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,559
tracking that's a little bit more manual

533
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
there was a huge wave of articles in may

534
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,960
june about should we be using these uh

535
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,120
cycle apps should we delete it do we

536
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
need to delete all this data um that can

537
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,160
actually have serious health

538
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
implications for a lot of women who

539
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
really need to track their cycle

540
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,400
the controversies around these actually

541
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
even predates uh what happened in may

542
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,600
this ftc consent order

543
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
is from january 2011. sorry 2021 i can

544
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,559
totally talk

545
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,440
um

546
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
flow was releasing a lot of data to

547
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
advertisers and not really letting their

548
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
users

549
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,280
know that like hey you're putting this

550
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,760
very sensitive information into the app

551
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,039
and you know we're sending it to

552
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,880
advertisers

553
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,120
and apple health and google fit

554
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
finally woke up i realize a lot of women

555
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,640
use fitness trackers and added cycle

556
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,039
tracking just directly as like a primary

557
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,960
uh sort of thing that can be tracked

558
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
through those platforms

559
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,840
and i think that i took this picture

560
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
from google fit i actually looking at it

561
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
i don't remember this is apple health or

562
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
google fit but it's pretty somewhere

563
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
between the two of them

564
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
you can just go in and enter the data

565
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
so i've been tossing around a lot of

566
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,720
terms

567
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,799
about apple health and so forth

568
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
these are the four really biggest

569
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
players in this field

570
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
and they all inter-operate so when i

571
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,000
ride on my peloton i send the data to

572
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,360
apple health

573
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
and then it sends it to google fit so

574
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,320
they all have apis and work and so your

575
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,640
data's kind of replicating out among

576
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
there one of the other reasons why these

577
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
are sort of the big ones in the field

578
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,880
is that each one of these also supports

579
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
a lot of third-party apps

580
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
um these are things like the peloton is

581
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
actually a third-party app in this uh

582
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,640
strava is somewhat a third-party app on

583
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
uh you know fitbit and so forth and

584
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
there's tons of other different apps you

585
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
can get

586
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
to plug in like sleep trackers

587
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
meditation so forth

588
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
there's also wildly bettering quality

589
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
this is my favorite fitbit app like we

590
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,080
came across this and we were

591
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
doing you know looking over various apps

592
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
in the field

593
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,559
this app

594
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,080
literally does nothing but put a roach

595
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
on your fitbit watch and have it dance

596
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
around i at first saw this i was like oh

597
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
this is like one of those flashlight

598
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
mobile apps that really steals your

599
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,320
contacts but it appears not to it

600
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,360
actually doesn't ask for very many

601
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
permissions it literally just puts a

602
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,640
road check on your watch and dance

603
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
around

604
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
but if it wanted to it could have access

605
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
to all of your health information

606
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,360
there's a lot of trust that's happening

607
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,640
here

608
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
and the way that this is governed

609
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,039
in the google health and

610
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
google fit apple health so forth

611
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
sort of space is through permissions and

612
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
there's wildly varying permission models

613
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,600
among these

614
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
apple health is really good in that it

615
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,159
gives you the chance to app by app

616
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
share what data goes so this is my scale

617
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
asking for permissions

618
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,720
i'm unsure

619
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,200
why my skill needs my body temperature

620
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,480
uh

621
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
but i have it turned on because i was

622
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
too lazy to turn it off i could

623
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
individually toggle these off and on

624
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
it also allows it so you can see all the

625
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
stuff again i'm unsure why my scale

626
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,080
keeps reporting my height because so far

627
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,600
as i know it doesn't have a laser height

628
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,840
measurement but there i continue to be

629
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
somewhat short

630
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
google fit on the other hand has

631
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
much coarser permission sets so you can

632
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
basically give it access like vital

633
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
health or not and it's a little harder

634
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,760
on app by app to say like yes to

635
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,799
temperature

636
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,760
no heart rate

637
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,679
they do however give you some really

638
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,200
nice ways to delete data if you decide

639
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,799
you no longer trust google fit no longer

640
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
want to use it they have google takeout

641
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,080
and a bunch of other stuff but right

642
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
from within the app you can go in and

643
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,360
delete a bunch of saved data

644
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,559
and so one of the other nice ways to see

645
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,559
all the data that these apps support and

646
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,679
that you can

647
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,200
save and whatever is to go through their

648
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
developer nodes so i've spent tons of

649
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,280
time going through developer sdks uh in

650
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,480
the health space

651
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
and looking at like what could i be

652
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
storing in this system

653
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
um so here i can track cervical mucus

654
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
which is something that people look at

655
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
if you're pregnant if you're trying to

656
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
become pregnant

657
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,480
um this would all be obviously so far

658
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
self-reported i believe you could write

659
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
an app that attempts to auto write this

660
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
i can report the results of an ovulation

661
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
test if i wanted to

662
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
i can report spotting if you're looking

663
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
to prove that someone had a miscarriage

664
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
this might be some data that you would

665
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,720
want to look at and it google fit has

666
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,880
an api to read and write it

667
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
so one of the other things

668
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,919
in addition to the primary health stores

669
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,799
and the third party apps is embedded ad

670
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,240
libraries because this is the mobile

671
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
ecosystem that we live in and it's

672
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
actually not often

673
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,400
displaying ads to you like there are

674
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,320
certainly apps that will show you

675
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
ads

676
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
this is much more

677
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
uh the apps collecting data and sending

678
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,799
it to third parties who then want to use

679
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,000
the information to market to you

680
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
apple health has recently done a bunch

681
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,480
of

682
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
basically ux improvements to surface to

683
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,080
you what sort of

684
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,960
permissions stuff is going to request

685
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
this is the moody cycle tracker

686
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
showing you roughly what types of data

687
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
it's going to

688
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,760
to collect

689
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,880
this is another one which i cannot

690
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,280
remember i should oh flow this is flow

691
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,919
showing you uh what sort of data you're

692
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,960
going to collect you can see it's a

693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,240
little different

694
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,360
um

695
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,520
the data linked

696
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,480
to you location and usage and so forth

697
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
here we had a bunch of other stuff

698
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,559
that is not linked to you so this is a

699
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,520
much more privacy protective app

700
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,080
than this one and so flow had the ftc

701
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
consent decree it's part of why i went

702
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,039
and i was like i'm curious what they're

703
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,880
showing that they're using and so you as

704
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
a user can educate yourself and say like

705
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
oh well i'm a little concerned about all

706
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
this data being linked to me and flow

707
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,840
holding it you know maybe i'm okay with

708
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,679
this being in apple health

709
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
uh data centers because apple health has

710
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
a really good legal team they have

711
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
strong protections and we're gonna

712
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,880
actually talk about how apple health

713
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,159
stores this stuff

714
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,240
but who knows what flow does maybe flow

715
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
has a server uh under a developer's desk

716
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,440
plugged in like at their home

717
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
like i am unsure what their security and

718
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
privacy protections are

719
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
hipaa does not apply so you know we're

720
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
not necessarily even encrypting this

721
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,559
stuff

722
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,400
the other one that

723
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,480
is not as invasive as ad libraries but

724
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
is also somewhat of a problem is

725
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
the crash analytics and usage and so

726
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
forth stuff that you can include in your

727
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
apps a lot of developers include third

728
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
party things

729
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
that will basically clack track how

730
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
people use the apps or where our error

731
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
is occurring

732
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,080
they're really good for helping

733
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
developers make the app better because

734
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
they give them a lot of useful data

735
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,080
side effect of that in a health app is

736
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,000
that they're gonna know what was on

737
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
essentially the screen where the error

738
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
happened uh maybe

739
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,279
you know your heart rate spiked really

740
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,440
high and it couldn't handle a heart rate

741
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
of you know 199 beats per minute and so

742
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
therefore you overflowed some field and

743
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
so now they have that information also

744
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
and so again this is just an apple

745
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,960
health app screenshot

746
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,240
sort of showing that it's collecting

747
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
usage information

748
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
and it's linking it to your account so

749
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,919
you can collect it a little bit more

750
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
anonymously or

751
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
tied to a particular phone

752
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,279
so we're putting a lot of trust in the

753
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,720
companies that hold this stuff

754
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
um and we think a lot of times uh in the

755
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
field about protecting from like hackers

756
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
uh protecting you know from accidental

757
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,799
data breaches and so forth we don't

758
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
always think about protecting from the

759
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,679
government

760
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,440
um unless you know you've been in the

761
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
civil liberties space for a long time

762
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,960
this is a little bit more of a new angle

763
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
on some of this and so there's been a

764
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
lot of talk about you know like what is

765
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
microsoft going to do what is amazon

766
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,240
going to do and part of the reason why i

767
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,679
had to redo this talk this week is

768
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,279
i believe on monday this came out

769
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
there's a teenager in nebraska

770
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,240
who had her mom helped her self-manage

771
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
an abortion

772
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,520
her friend went to the police

773
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
told them about this

774
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,960
the police came and interviewed her she

775
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
scrolled through her phone

776
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
while they were there

777
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,600
and so

778
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
the police got a warrant this came out i

779
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,640
believe

780
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
tuesday i think i put the slide in on

781
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
tuesday

782
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,039
they released the warrant saying well we

783
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,559
saw them scroll through the phone and we

784
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,400
believe there's evidence evidence of a

785
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
murder

786
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
in the facebook messages that she showed

787
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,400
us

788
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
and they went to facebook

789
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,440
with a warrant for facebook message data

790
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
about a murder

791
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,520
and uh the message

792
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,679
were released and so uh the police are

793
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
saying that this shows that yes she did

794
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
have an abortion

795
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
i think they said 24 weeks which they

796
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
say it's illegal in nebraska

797
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,960
um and so

798
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,279
i put this in mostly to show

799
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,840
that still we are not really looking at

800
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,600
fitness tracker data yet like it's great

801
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
that we're aware of all this and we do

802
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,360
need apple health and google fit and

803
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,799
whatever protect this information if

804
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,159
police become interested in it but

805
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,360
that's not even where the fight is right

806
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,799
how the fight is over

807
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,480
you know messages and whatever

808
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
but they do have all our health

809
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
information

810
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,799
and it's

811
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,799
apple is pretty open

812
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,919
about

813
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,799
uh

814
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,080
like google

815
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
what sorts of

816
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
data they will turn over in response to

817
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,000
what sorts of legal requests that come

818
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,120
in

819
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,960
apple's legal process guide again that's

820
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,159
a link you're welcome to click on it

821
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
when i put the slides out we'll give you

822
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
extensive information about what you

823
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,600
would get and

824
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,520
you know in return for a warrant and so

825
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,880
forth

826
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
apple stores all health data in cloud

827
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,000
kit which is what they use for icloud

828
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
and so it is actually end-to-end

829
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,679
encrypted and it's fairly limited uh

830
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,360
what apple can actually see this is very

831
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,799
similar to the problem that have

832
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
happened with the apple versus fbi fight

833
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
where the messages were encrypted and

834
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679
apple's like we're sorry we can't give

835
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,440
you the plaintext of this because we

836
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,520
don't have access to it this is similar

837
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,679
to if you use signal or some other

838
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
end-to-end encrypted messaging

839
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
service

840
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
and apple has recently put out some

841
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
guidance about how they protect users

842
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,279
health data

843
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
um talking about you know its end and

844
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,000
encrypted we use very high standards of

845
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
security protect it and so forth

846
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,960
google

847
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
also put some stuff out saying yes we

848
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
also protect health data

849
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
one of the things that google noted is

850
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
that google fit is a fairly small player

851
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,520
in this space

852
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,080
but google maps is huge a lot of people

853
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,320
use location history i actually have

854
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
location history on my phone i found i

855
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,679
found it super useful if i want to be

856
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
like oh my gosh i was on vacation this

857
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,559
place i went to this really great donut

858
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
shop and like i want to go back when i

859
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,559
go back three years later let me go like

860
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
look roughly at the dates and see where

861
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
i was and so i personally have found a

862
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,000
lot of use out of it so i keep it on but

863
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
this is again you need to think

864
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,880
carefully about should i turn it off for

865
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
a few days should i bring my phone with

866
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
me

867
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,520
um i know people generally recommend

868
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,399
like

869
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,320
if you are in one of these situations

870
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,679
don't do something weird like you always

871
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,960
use your phone all of a sudden you don't

872
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
because that can look suspicious

873
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
um but that's a little bit outside the

874
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,720
purview of this talk but so they realize

875
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,919
that this location data is very

876
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,000
sensitive i don't want people to have to

877
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,679
make these uh

878
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
choices about like do i incriminate

879
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,399
myself and not bring my phone or

880
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,480
incriminate myself by bringing my phone

881
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
and so they're on their end deleting a

882
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,840
lot of location data in sensitive

883
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,480
areas

884
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,320
um

885
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
they are basically improving the sort of

886
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,039
information if they show you about what

887
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,120
the health apps track so very similar to

888
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
those apple health screenshots that i

889
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
showed they're doing some work there too

890
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,799
and they have um

891
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
basically a little verb about how they

892
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,039
push back and over broad warrants um

893
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,880
so i know from my time working in this

894
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,399
stuff that there are all kinds of ways

895
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,080
that lawrence can be goofy

896
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,159
and you can either choose to be like

897
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,919
okay i'm going to read this as it really

898
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,679
should have been and give you the data

899
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,880
or i'm going to reject the entire

900
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,799
warrant on a technicality and so they

901
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,880
try to push back a lot of technicalities

902
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,799
that can be very expensive it's a lot of

903
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,039
attorney attorney time so google can do

904
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,960
this but a lot of the smaller

905
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
folks uh can't

906
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,039
and also

907
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
remember uh this data is also in the

908
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
smaller third-party apps

909
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,200
uh and so i was like i wonder if any of

910
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
them are putting out guidance like apple

911
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,200
and google just did

912
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,080
uh it turns out not really

913
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,360
this is flow's privacy policy

914
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
they know like hey we secure your data

915
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
and they actually

916
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
say like hey you might not want to

917
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,559
delete your data because then our app

918
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,320
might not function the way that the way

919
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,200
that it's supposed to

920
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,880
aura ring

921
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,360
has some stuff up where they talk about

922
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
locations and period protection whatever

923
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,120
they don't say a lot about what they're

924
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,039
going to do in response to

925
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
warrants that come

926
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
strava also has some stuff up talking

927
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,039
about the information that they have

928
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,200
not really a lot about hey what are we

929
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
going to do if we get a warrant for

930
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
someone's location information showing

931
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,159
that they were near an abortion clinic

932
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,480
or not

933
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,600
so as we've been mentioning

934
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,200
a lot of this fitness tracker stuff

935
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,279
really is just circumstantial evidence

936
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,279
was a person pregnant are they now not

937
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
pregnant did they go near an abortion

938
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,039
clinic this is not

939
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,279
like a text message saying i went had an

940
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
abortion

941
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,440
so

942
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
one of the things people are concerned

943
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
about is the states where abortion is

944
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
illegal after six months sorry six weeks

945
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
or so um

946
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,240
that they will try to find like the date

947
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
of a woman's last period and use that to

948
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,679
prove that you know we know an abortion

949
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,440
happened and it happened after a certain

950
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,399
date that is illegal in this state

951
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,159
and so there is a lot of concern about

952
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,480
what they could infer from the fitness

953
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
tracker data

954
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
again i have not seen any cases where

955
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,440
this has happened yet but we're also

956
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
still very early days

957
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,399
um

958
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,240
one of the scenarios here that people

959
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,159
worry about is traveling to another

960
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,320
state to have an abortion so did you go

961
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
to that state were you pregnant when you

962
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
went to this state

963
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,120
are you now not pregnant um there's been

964
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,279
a lot of speculation about what might

965
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,840
happen here what will happen with uh

966
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,279
crimes across state lines and so forth

967
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,679
another one is i'm at home and i order

968
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,519
uh millwater pills or i get a hold of

969
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,799
pills some other way and i do a

970
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
self-managed abortion at home this is

971
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,159
probably where they're gonna look for

972
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,360
search history um

973
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,039
probably what really seems to be

974
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,399
happening in these sort of cases is what

975
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
happened in nebraska where

976
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,159
you tell someone that you had a

977
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
self-managed abortion and they go to the

978
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
police so i've seen a lot of stuff out

979
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,080
there saying honestly the best advice

980
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,519
here is to

981
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,760
think very carefully about who you trust

982
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,399
and who you talk to

983
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
and again this tends to be search

984
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
history and text message or you know

985
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,880
facebook message sort of stuff

986
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,840
so

987
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,000
a lot of this uh like in all things

988
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,159
since computer security comes down to it

989
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,360
depends

990
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,600
uh what is your risk model

991
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
um i am still using fitness trackers i'm

992
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,600
also extremely lucky to live in

993
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,039
washington state and i'm a very

994
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
privileged person where i could up and

995
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,200
fly to other states or i could probably

996
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,919
go to canada very easily

997
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,320
if you are a teenager living in texas or

998
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,519
so forth you're in a very different

999
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
situation than i'm in

1000
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,799
and one of the things that's very scary

1001
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
with these is pretty much any woman

1002
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,360
could be subject to an ectopic pregnancy

1003
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
if they accidentally got pregnant

1004
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
and those are always fatal if they are

1005
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,399
not handled and there's a lot of state

1006
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,640
abortion bans that are trying to include

1007
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
these

1008
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,000
so this is non-opsec talk

1009
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
uh but i'll throw a little bit in here

1010
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
um

1011
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
new york times had a fairly good article

1012
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,720
that was written you know mostly to a

1013
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,840
general public that talks about a

1014
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
handful of things like turning off

1015
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
location sharing although again think

1016
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
carefully about turning it off just for

1017
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,320
two days

1018
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,840
um resetting mobile tracking ids on your

1019
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,679
phone so that you can't necessarily be

1020
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,840
tracked across all these different apps

1021
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,919
um telling google to just never store

1022
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,480
location history and so forth there's a

1023
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,480
group called digital defense fund that

1024
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
does amazing work here if you're

1025
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,159
interested in this stuff they are really

1026
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,159
who you want to talk to and read their

1027
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,360
guidance

1028
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,399
they have a wonderful abortion privacy

1029
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,480
link up on their website and this is a

1030
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,040
really great graphic that they made

1031
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,359
um and talks about all kinds of ways to

1032
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,960
protect yourself like these are the

1033
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,079
experts

1034
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,239
i know about hipaa and i know somewhat

1035
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,079
about threat modeling fitness trackers i

1036
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,879
am not an abortion privacy person i mean

1037
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,239
i guess maybe i kind of am since i give

1038
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,760
me this talk but not really these are

1039
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,599
the experts this is who you really want

1040
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,440
to go talk to

1041
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
and these folks have done some vetting

1042
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,599
of period tracking tracking apps and i

1043
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,040
went and looked at them and i agree

1044
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,560
these are probably your best bet if you

1045
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,879
need to use a period tracker um because

1046
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,320
they're not tracking that much and

1047
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
they're very privacy protective it's

1048
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
like apple health is end to end

1049
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,760
encrypted and you have apple's attorneys

1050
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,199
and some of these are tracking just

1051
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,560
locally not syncing it into a cloud

1052
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,639
so if you want to use one those are

1053
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,560
pretty good options

1054
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
but again

1055
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,679
really it's this fitness tracker stuff

1056
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
is kind of cool

1057
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
as a privacy nerd it's interesting to

1058
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,160
look at but this is not where the real

1059
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,000
threat is the threat is text messages

1060
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
and so forth

1061
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,480
and they're looking at search history

1062
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,720
so throw up a couple resources these are

1063
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
people who are actually experts

1064
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,800
in this um

1065
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,160
kendra maggie and emma did a really nice

1066
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,560
medium post fear uncertainty and period

1067
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,000
trackers that really goes through a lot

1068
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,960
of this and they have sort of a

1069
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,880
follow-up talking about like

1070
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
how period trackers could be used to try

1071
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,880
to prove women are pregnant um it's

1072
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,079
great

1073
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,200
and so that's my talk i think i have

1074
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
some time for questions

1075
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
cool okay and somewhere around there is

1076
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,078
a mic

1077
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
all right

1078
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
if you ask a question if i can't hear

1079
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
i'll ask you to come up closer to me and

1080
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,480
i will try to repeat it so who has one

1081
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
okay the question was i talk a lot about

1082
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
end-to-end encryption as a way that

1083
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,599
companies can protect user privacy and

1084
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,200
there's a question are there any laws

1085
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
about that like he said specifically

1086
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,240
about deleting data

1087
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
oh wow that is the canon the worms uh

1088
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,280
kind of somewhat was avoiding here

1089
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
uh if you work in this space you're

1090
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,079
probably aware there's a lot of push to

1091
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,760
say that law enforcement has to always

1092
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
be able to get into messages it sort of

1093
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,359
comes from an apple versus fbi fight

1094
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,720
with terrorism there's a lot of concerns

1095
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
about csam child sexual abuse material

1096
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
and so forth

1097
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,200
these are very legitimate concerns um

1098
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,359
they still have very far-ranging privacy

1099
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,200
issues and obviously if you have

1100
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,880
end-to-end encryption that is

1101
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,480
intentionally broken by law enforcement

1102
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
that is in my definition no longer end

1103
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,839
and encrypted i do not trust law

1104
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,200
enforcement to keep the

1105
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
whatever escrow keys they use

1106
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,599
private uh you can all go read about

1107
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
matt blaze's fun with the clipper chip

1108
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,000
um i'm a huge fan of encryption history

1109
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,640
so yeah well that is a huge

1110
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
policy sort of fight that is happening

1111
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,920
in the us and uk and in australia and i

1112
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
have given talks on it i'm not an expert

1113
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,359
on that uh

1114
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
write to your senators and tell them we

1115
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,560
still need and then encryption because

1116
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,599
it does more good than harm

1117
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,839
foreign

1118
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,200
so the comment was that you can just not

1119
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
collect data

1120
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
so those period trackers that i showed

1121
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,520
at least

1122
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,800
yuki and drip sort of take that approach

1123
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,720
that is very hard in our ad driven

1124
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
ecosystem

1125
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,680
i spent many years at amazon as a

1126
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,359
developer working on personalization

1127
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
recommendations i'm well aware of the

1128
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,520
business need to collect a lot of

1129
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,599
information it is such an uphill fight

1130
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,440
there are people who like

1131
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,640
you know

1132
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
try to fight that i use u-block origin

1133
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,079
in my browser which blocks a lot of

1134
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,960
stuff and i still get ads follow me

1135
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,240
around the internet and i'm like okay

1136
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
come on i'm using chrome with this ad

1137
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
walker why do i see the same pair of

1138
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
shoes on every or

1139
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
you know forced into my facebook feed or

1140
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,640
on instagram and so forth so yes uh but

1141
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
i really don't like privacy and security

1142
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,640
advice that sort of puts the fault on

1143
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,040
users i prefer policy changes and so

1144
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
forth and so i

1145
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,599
yes that's a way to protect us but it

1146
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,720
it's not a really realistic answer

1147
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,279
any other

1148
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
no other questions all right awesome

1149
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,680
thank you so much for coming to my talk

1150
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,680
you
