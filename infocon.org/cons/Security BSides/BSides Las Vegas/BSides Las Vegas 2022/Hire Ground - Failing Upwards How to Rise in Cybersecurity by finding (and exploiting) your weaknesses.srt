9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm in recruit my marketing and I knew

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,980
that the conversation was not happening

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,920
in a valuable and safe space for people

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,400
in our industry to find a job so I asked

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,560
a few friends to come in and do resume

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,739
review and career coaching asked a few

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,340
people to do presentations that would

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,980

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,420
before no one's presented this yet as

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,040
far as I'm aware this is the first time

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,439

82
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,280

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,099
well

85
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,540
um I put that on my professional list

86
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,819
not that I hold that title it's more

87
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,200
that that actually helps my job that

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,060
actually helps me do my job so it's kind

89
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,599
of what I do to help the main gig so to

90
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,739
speak

91
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,360

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,599
um I play lots of video games when I

94
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,159
have the time I walk around the world

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,659
sometimes and I also hack in my free

96
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,400
time my current hobby horse these days

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,560
is RFID badge cloning who thinks that's

98
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,599
cool because I think that's yeah oh so

99
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,659
many friends yes okay

100
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,720
um so and then but why am I like this

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
um I like Puzzles and I seek novelty

102
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,620
that's kind of the short version uh also

103
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,680
anxiety so that's enough of me

104
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,080
um before we start on this though just a

105
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,819
few things just kind of level set and

106
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,519
manage expectations a little bit

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
um I'm going to start with by explaining

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,540
by clarifying what is failing upwards in

109
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,560
the first place

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,760
um I'm going to tell you my story I'm

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
really sorry about that you're gonna

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,580
have to sit through my story to hear how

113
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,560
to do this thing

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,299
um and I'm gonna set some scenes for you

115
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,580
set some mental space on what mental

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,320
angle you should find yourself in if to

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,298
try this out uh then we're actually

118
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,858
going to get to the steps on failing

119
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,440
upwards in the first place

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
um and then we're gonna do some final

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,620
final words as we go

122
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,440
um and this is a really like long

123
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,540
presentation because it's really nuanced

124
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,460
and I'm sorry for that but uh if you

125
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,960
want to ask questions feel free to

126
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,580
you're going to dislodge me a little bit

127
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,720
but I promise you're also going to put

128
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,220
me back on track at the same time so

129
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,139
feel free to yell things out hey you're

130
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,300
wrong please do

131
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
um that's gonna help that's help me

132
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,320
Focus bring me up to speed

133
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,300
some assumptions I'm expecting that

134
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,060
everybody in this room has you want that

135
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,560
you want to get ahead and that you know

136
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
where you want to go and that you have

137
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,240
some idea of the job you want to have

138
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,280
um this is largely based on the idea of

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,259
rising into management because I think

140
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,360
we all kind of at some point decided we

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,580
don't want to be on call anymore

142
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,180
so yeah uh it's kind of like that

143
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,979
also I'm making another assumption which

144
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,539
is that uh most of you are already

145
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,060
inside the uh it or security space

146
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,800
already if you're breaking into the

147
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
field this is also applicable just less

148
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
so

149
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,860
and uh then also one another assumption

150
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,660
is you have is that I'm assuming you're

151
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,300
willing to get weird

152
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,080
okay yeah yeah perfect perfect

153
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,180
um some disclaimers your mileage your

154
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,820
mileage may your mileage will vary your

155
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,680
mileage will vary because this is a very

156
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,620
nuanced subject it's very personal to

157
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,180
every person uh the reason why I'm

158
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,560
telling you my story is because that's

159
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,300
how I can give you examples it's going

160
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,800
to be different for everybody another

161
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,840
thing is I want to say out loud I see my

162
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,419
privilege I recognize that I am CIS male

163
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,060
I recognize I'm Caucasian and vaguely

164
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,759
tall these things do contribute to this

165
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,979
they do uh to the success that I've

166
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,020
found that said the reason why I'm

167
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,520
talking about it in the first place is

168
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,500
because I have seen people who are

169
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
ethnic minorities and gender minorities

170
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,039
do the same process again just like me

171
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,880
accidentally

172
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,560
because I don't think anyone tries to

173
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
fail upward necessarily until tomorrow

174
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,060
right

175
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,919
but in any case it's almost always

176
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,740
accidental and I've seen people who are

177
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,380
not like me also succeed this way

178
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,479
and this is and just a bit of a warning

179
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,660
this looks easy and is hard by the by

180
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,100
trying to go through this process you're

181
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,419
basically putting yourself in a position

182
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,699
of vulnerability as a means of

183
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,740
succeeding long term you're putting your

184
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,620
Stakes up high I don't expect anyone to

185
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,180
risk their jobs over this another thing

186
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,699
I want to say out loud but

187
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,360
um

188
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,100
the way this works is that you're going

189
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,199
to have fun with it and I mean that it

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,580
really helps to have a good time doing

191
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,720
this because that's going to sell the

192
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,220
Charisma which is going to get you there

193
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,660
in the first place

194
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,759
so that's a lot of disclaimers I talk

195
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,800
too long let's discuss failing upwards

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
what does that even mean well if you

197
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,120
look it up on Google these days it looks

198
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,979
like this to advance in one's career

199
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,919
despite failure and you know the thing

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
is that's that's that's not exactly the

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,639
thing I'm talking about today that's not

202
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,500
exactly the process of failing upwards

203
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,780
if you've ever had a boss who is just

204
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,818
like how did how are you managing me

205
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,740
you know he failed upwards he he found

206
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,199
himself in a role that he is not trained

207
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
to do by doing a job this by doing a job

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,060
above his above his rank too long and

209
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,340
somehow he somehow he's managing others

210
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,860
that's this sentence to advance in your

211
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,360
career despite failure that's career

212
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,699
resilience not failing upwards there's a

213
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,780
very big difference here that's not what

214
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,220
I'm talking about today you can you can

215
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,720
be you can be strong and powerful and

216
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,280
employed but what we're talking about

217
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,960
today is how to rise

218
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,580
so

219
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,440
but why would you fail upward why not

220
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,060
just go the normal path and work hard

221
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,240
and get promoted because it doesn't work

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,819
it just doesn't work there's no reason

223
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,460
not one reason a manager has to promote

224
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,099
you for a good job

225
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,680
they are literally disincent

226
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,479
disincentivized at every single time how

227
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,940
many Engineers analysts in the room like

228
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,800
key stakeholders in the technology level

229
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,259
yeah so I'm gonna guess each one of you

230
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,660
has been told you're really important

231
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,580
yeah yeah

232
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,539
so

233
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,580
the trick is is that if you why you

234
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,259
would want to fit why you would want to

235
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,599
fail upwards is because that's a because

236
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,819
you want or need to get an advanced job

237
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,500
maybe you have bills to pay maybe you've

238
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,639
got maybe you've got maybe you've got

239
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,139
goals you got that like eight mile

240
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,940
energy on you

241
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,740
um you know good employees don't usually

242
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,059
get promoted frequently they do

243
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,860
frequently they do

244
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,320
but it's not guaranteed it's really not

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,539
and managers if you're looking to rise

246
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,339
into management what does a manager do

247
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,040
truly I mean they have job duties but

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
what does a manager what does management

249
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,540
quality even mean right and there's you

250
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,940
can you can I mean can anyone give me n

251
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,820

252
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,220

carrot and stick yes carrot on a stick

256
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,940
even better do it double it up

257
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,620

this thank you I made a special request

262

264

thank you so much

277

this guy this guy thank you very much

278
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,260
what the hell was I talking about

279
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,600
anyway did I tell you the okay so do

280
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
1982 was a real classic but it's really

281
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
no it wasn't that

282
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,160
um

283
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,500
let's move on how do but but the

284
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,880
mechanics are failing upwards let's talk

285
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,380
about that

286
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,300
um how does how does failing upwards

287
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
work mechanically like what is the

288
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,019
process of failing upwards um I'm going

289
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,399
to go into a greater depth on this this

290
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,779
is just a bit of a summary but the short

291
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,000
version is counter signaling which in

292
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,019
this case actually

293
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,220
bigger summary it's uh subtle emotional

294
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,880
um

295
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,399
subconscious cues that you get and

296
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,920
there's also social constructs like um

297
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,540
which we'll get to in a moment so things

298
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,339
like counter signaling which is for

299
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,600
example to say something negative to

300
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,140
indicate positive or to uh bias for

301
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
Action you know just doing something is

302
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,800
better than doing nothing

303
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,140
um cronyism frankly that is the x that

304
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,279
is the attack surface we're talking

305
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,320
about today so cronyism how do you break

306
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
into it it's exploitable

307
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,899
print and principles of influence uh any

308
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,519
social engineers in the room

309
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,220
oh see I figured you would see that that

310
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,140
much Style no that's a social engineer

311
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,980
right there

312
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,560
so right here the social Engineers are

313
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,940
going to recognize the six principles of

314
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,200
influence I'm going to reference three

315
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,980
of them which in this case is

316
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,560
reciprocity I give you give uh social

317
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,899
social proof we uh we all approve this

318
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,880
or likability because frankly that's

319
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
needed

320
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,700
um and I just want to apologize in

321
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,260
advance because the one thing that I

322
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,940
really wanted to spend time on and I

323
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,920
can't is how to how to build your

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
charisma and your communication skills

325
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,360
because that is how this comes together

326
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,820
I'm sorry I have resources at the end at

327
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,040
the end of the presentation but we're

328
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,180
just gonna have to take me on faith that

329
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,240
that one matters so sorry about that

330
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,500
that said

331
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
is it really truly a thing people still

332
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,800
do is this does this happen all the time

333
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,830
as a matter of fact it does

334
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,139
[Music]

335
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,360
um two articles ten years apart these

336
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,560
are things that actually are still

337
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,540
subject matter today in business circles

338
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,120
uh it is extremely normal to find people

339
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,459
failing upwards people are seeing it as

340
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,959
a problem because people are getting

341
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,339
into jobs that they're not skilled to

342
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,459
have

343
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,500
but be that as it may uh this is

344
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,060
actually a really really normal thing to

345
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,339
do every company experiences this every

346
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,019
company deals with this this is in fact

347
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,420
a way of business that goes back as far

348
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
as corporate life does so take me on

349
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,279
faith on this believe me there's lots of

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,279
examples of failing upwards now

351
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,600
let me go through let me go through the

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,920
boring stuff then we'll get to the

353
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,380
interesting stuff so I gotta tell you

354
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,700
this for for the reasons of giving

355
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,779
examples

356
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,760
here's a here's here's kind of how I got

357
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,500
into this and how I failed through this

358
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,019
process on the childhood side

359
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,139
you know I was I was into geek stuff you

360
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,180
know video games and movies mostly kind

361
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,800
of was the audio visual guy from my

362
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,899
family small hands behind the TV sort of

363
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,779
stuff and um and I also in my free time

364
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,820
I I messed with my game genie it was a

365
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,200
man in the middle device which allowed

366
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,300
you to input new codes into games and

367
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,920
change the gameplay this guy knows what

368
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,959
I'm talking about game game shark is

369
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
good too okay that's that's PlayStation

370
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,399
era I like it and um

371
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,740
and so yeah but uh so I went so I and I

372
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,899
was like and turns out old TVs older CRT

373
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,240
TVs turns out you can brick them

374
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,500
um by playing with the settings too much

375
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,200
so fun fact

376
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,060
um teenage years I got into martial arts

377
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,740
that was helping my anxiety a lot still

378
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,120
lots of geek stuff but now I'm into

379
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
robotics now I'm now I'm now I'm like

380
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,300
building stuff and I'm social

381
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,740
engineering I did not know that's what I

382
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,320
was doing but that's what I was doing in

383
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,500
college Years I was into politics I I

384
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,420
flunked out of a double major in

385
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,220
politics in fact

386
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,839
um then I got a degree in education I

387
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,639
couldn't quite pick a lane

388
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,660
um and in my free time I was

389
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
jailbreaking iPhones and writing a

390
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,079
cyberbunk novel

391
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,279
um

392
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,320
still still in progress

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
and um

394
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,980
and then early career I you know while

395
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm flunking out of your University I

396
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,040
figured I'd pick up some retail

397
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,540
Hospitality work you know just kind of

398
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,339
pay the bills and while I'm doing this

399
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,199
people keep asking hey Wes knows that

400
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,660
West knows that he can fix that

401
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,060
um because it at no point in my entire

402
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,620
childhood did I connect that I should

403
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,660
probably get into technology

404
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,220
not once it had occurred to me maybe I

405
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,320
should pick up Tech work as a as a

406
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,940
profession

407
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,040
um but I finally eventually did crawled

408
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,260
my way into that space

409
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,480
um starting with a job in China I was a

410
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,000
technical pre-sales in China now uh for

411
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,040
those less aware of the way China sells

412
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,620
to China uh there is a there's a when

413
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,360
you do a business conference and you

414
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,779
want people to see your business as

415
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,399
prestigious and international even if it

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,800
isn't uh you hire a white guy to stand

417
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
there in a suit and be Caucasian and

418
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,820
white in your booth I was a booth babe

419
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,940
for about a while

420
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,459
um no no don't talk don't talk you're

421
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,560
not supposed to talk do not use your

422
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,899
terrible Chinese on your customers

423
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,940
um stand there and be Caucasian uh but

424
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,260
in my free time I learned some of the

425
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,699
technical stuff

426
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,860
and that kind of but I was doing that to

427
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,600
move to China to move to Japan because

428
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
my goal of time was in education to be a

429
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,339
teacher in Japan for the rest of my life

430
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,300
you know

431
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,980
that worked well

432
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,420
um I went back and forth and back and

433
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,800
forth for a while and I was doing Shadow

434
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
I.T the entire time

435
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
and it finally occurred to me maybe I

436
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,320
should get into it eventually so I so I

437
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,959
pick up this basic I.T job tier one help

438
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,420
desk at a foreign currency trading

439
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,760
foreign currency exchange company in

440
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,699
downtown Tokyo and um

441
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,040
yeah so there's all that I finally it

442
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,300
finally I finally got there I got like

443
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,920
all they you know I can finally this is

444
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,100
my job now now I can fix things all the

445
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,899
time and of course everything's broken

446
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,600
so I see everything needs fixing so I

447
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,279
started off with help desk and then I

448
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,779
see that no one's working on the data

449
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,160
centers I think of some data center work

450
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,259
then I then move more synthesis admin

451
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,060
that it morphs into Data Center

452
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,459
Administration I.T risk management I.T

453
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,959
compliance

454
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,540
um uh multi-data multi-data Center

455
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,399
Administration project management for

456
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,500
the Asia Pacific region

457
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,420
um I burned out I burned out real hard

458
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,459
just like university only much harder

459
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,699
and uh there's a there's a separate and

460
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,320
parallel lesson to that which is that if

461
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,899
you're gonna burn out just before you do

462
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,180
let go of some of the things that are

463
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,040
keeping you and that that you can

464
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,079
actually like not burn out as hard so

465
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,459
holding on to everything is how you burn

466
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,800
out faster so Pro tip

467
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
but anyway

468
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,160
here's where the failure really kicks

469
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,660
off is

470
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,940
I I burned out so hard I had to fall

471
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,399
back to the United States for a while

472
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,459
and I picked up a cloud sysadmin job uh

473
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,779
just something kind of basic just get

474
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,100
the job done

475
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,779
um it was easy to get work as engineers

476
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,579
in the room probably are aware

477
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,199
um especially when I was doing literally

478
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,699
everything for this company for like a

479
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,540
period of six months and so but

480
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,759
they hired me to just basically kind of

481
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,500
be there but it kind of occurred to me

482
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,000
as I was in the process of helping with

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,620
their Cloud migration and their and

484
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,360
their their systems Administration for

485
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880
AWS it occurred to me I'm not great at

486
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,820
this like I am mediocre

487
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,599
truly I am I am unexceptional and they

488
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,459
they did not hire unexceptional they

489
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,400
they hired this rock star from Japan uh

490
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,919
but no no I'm basic I'm like super basic

491
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,020
really

492
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,660
um and I was tired and so as I was tired

493
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,220
as I was trying to figure out how to go

494
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,260
about this job that I've signed up for

495
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,359
that I you know I liked I loved

496
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,099
technology and

497
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,620
um what do I do what do I do and so it's

498
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,760
like you know you look really pretty

499
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
tired you want to just manage the

500
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,059
content delivery network no one likes

501
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,140
that

502
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
um and that's true no one likes no one

503
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,000
likes CDs no one not a one

504
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,240
um and so I I liked the what I liked

505
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
doing was fine-tuning the laugh I'm That

506
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,919
Kind of nerd and um

507
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,179
and it kind of got me into doing

508
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,520
security Cloud Security Administration

509
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,919
to a lesser degree very beginning of

510
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,059
breaking into this into the security

511
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,140
space

512
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,640
but the pattern here I think you're

513
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,380
going to start to see is that

514
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,400
I I kind of over delivered over here and

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,780
under delivered over here and they just

516
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,820
kind of moved me a little bit right

517
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,380
that's kind of the the pattern is

518
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,660
starting to form

519
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,100
now that now here's where the task fails

520
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,660
successfully

521
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,500
um

522
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,600
around 2016 it occurred to me maybe it's

523
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,539
time to move overseas again

524
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,240
no particular reason and um I moved to

525
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,380
Netherlands I picked up a platform

526
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,880
engineer job

527
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,160
and at that point it was at that point

528
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,640
about six weeks in my boss at the time I

529
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,360
talked to him they say

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,880
I talked to my boss and I said I I I say

531
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,660
um

532
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,919
you know no one's doing the security

533
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,960
stuff in for this team should someone do

534
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
that it's like can you do it yeah I can

535
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,039
do that I don't mind uh so I got my

536
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,160
first security-ish job you know in 2016.

537
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,340
not that long ago and

538
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,919
um at that point they I look around I

539
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,020
say well how exactly do I secure this

540
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,460
company there's never been a security

541
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,679
person there still isn't I'm kind of not

542
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,460
it

543
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,940
and it occurs to me I need to do

544
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,160
everything again just like in Japan only

545
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,320
this time I got to do it from scratch

546
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,160
so I got to work I get to this I I go to

547
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,440
these meetups after work and I go to

548
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,179
conferences like this and learn about

549
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,640
security from from zero

550
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,039
um I equate my I acquaint myself with

551
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,480
the words and the terms of the people

552
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,360
that are would be my peers and I start

553
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,120
kind of like just picking services and

554
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,160
Technologies off a shelf and I shove

555
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,840
them into a box and make a presentation

556
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,660
out of it put it to the CSO and the the

557
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,820
CTO and

558
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,980
um and I just I do everything I do the

559
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,660
policy the design the architecture the

560
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,620
everything but the implementation

561
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,820
because I told you I'm a mediocre

562
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,660
engineer right mediocre truly I had help

563
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,940
putting in place but I designed it all I

564
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,640
designed it all I organized it

565
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,500
um I set up the set up instant response

566
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,059
I wrote policies procedures the

567
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,340
governance I I chose my bosses off a

568
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,260
shelf off the org chart I wrote it all

569
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,000
up and I didn't ask permission I just

570
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,860
started doing it

571
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,620
um and I was also what because I was a

572
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,240
mediocre engineer no one expected me to

573
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,700
do much more in the job I was hired for

574
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,100
I was doing my on-call rotation I was

575
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,200
making sure the uptime was good I was

576
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,240
okay at my job but I was also building

577
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,580
security from zero

578
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,280
um and so that's when that's when it

579
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
truly failed that's when the fail upward

580
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,880
truly occurred is right after that

581
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,320
because

582
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,820
um at certain point

583
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,720
I finally a new ciso shows up and he

584
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,280
takes a look at what I built and he says

585
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,140
hey I see you've built a lot of stuff

586
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,760
it's like yeah yeah I'm really glad

587
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,020
you're here because we got a lot of work

588
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,400
to do

589
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,140
and

590
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,360
and he's and he looks and he says you

591
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,140
know I've been I've been I've been

592
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,280
hearing about the work you've been doing

593
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,559
you did all the governance and the risk

594
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,419
reg and the risk registration and the

595
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,460
the the the the the stuff I do it's like

596
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,980
yeah yeah I had yeah the previous ciso

597
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,440
wasn't doing that bit

598
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,080
um so so he's like hey would you like to

599
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,020
just be an infosec officer because I

600
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,400
think you're probably really good at

601
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,380
that and I need like two guys

602
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,940
so I'm like yeah that sounds good I'm

603
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,919
really tired

604
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,980
and so yeah so that so I worked for 18

605
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,840
months to build an entire Security State

606
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,580
from zero literally the entire thing

607
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,320
minus the implementation because a

608
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,700
mediocre engineer

609
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,539
and uh I didn't even get to run it

610
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,860
I didn't even get to touch the fruits of

611
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,539
my labor I handed it off to somebody and

612
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,240
I then ran risk management

613
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,860
um that's the fail upwards I'm talking

614
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,220
about in steps here uh just spoilers

615
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,840
um the set the last part is actually

616
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
pretty quick and less interesting which

617
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,780
is once you're in management as a

618
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,340
previous speaker was talking about once

619
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,020
you're there you're kind of there you

620
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,720
know so I was so a certain point about a

621
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,340
year into being an infosec officer I'm

622
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,440
like you know I'm just I don't like I

623
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,000
want a bigger View and I want to be able

624
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,140
to talk to the board because that's

625
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,880
easier for me to just talk to them

626
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
directly so but the CSO was good at his

627
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,900
job so I'm not going to take his job so

628
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,400
I just took a different one different

629
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,799
company and then I had to move back to

630
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,260
North America for personal reasons and I

631
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
like well if I'm gonna move I might as

632
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,980
well join an executive team and uh so I

633
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,860
just asked and here I am

634
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,659
so

635
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,940
um what he yeah I mean it really is

636
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,320
truly like once your management your

637
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,240
management you can step down but you

638
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,039
know it's easier to step up at that

639
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,600
point it's just crossing that Rubicon

640
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,240
into management that is the challenge

641
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,460
that people generally have which is what

642
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,400
we're talking about if I've yeah

643
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,980
she distracted me okay

644
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,600
anyway

645
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,820
failing upwards how does that actually

646
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,159
work here's the details the mechanics of

647
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,860
failing upward

648
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,760
countersignaling is the is basically

649
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,140
when you when you indicate something

650
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,419
with a negative you say something a

651
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:43,740
negative to indicate a positive it's not

652
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,440
exactly like like a like false praise or

653
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,260
false modesty it's more like when I like

654
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,340
uh uh who's the actor Tom Hardy is it

655
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,020
not Tim it's Tom right I always get

656
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,400
those mixed up thank you thank you

657
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
appreciate it he's a master at this he

658
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,700
basically will you if you see him ever

659
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,080
see ever see Tom Hardy talk about his

660
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,580
movies he will like talk about like his

661
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,860
personal struggles and he's not shy and

662
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,539
people love him because he because he's

663
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,799
counter signaling he's showing

664
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,380
confidence in himself by explaining

665
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,600
where he has failed in his life he's not

666
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
shy about he's not he's not burdened by

667
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,679
it that indicates strength and

668
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,820
confidence

669
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,679
bias for Action is another is another

670
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,480
key piece of this puzzle

671
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,000
even when people fail they've the fact

672
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,620
that they tried in the first place means

673
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,480
that they have actually put some effort

674
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,860
into it they believe in themselves at

675
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,159
least enough to put themselves out there

676
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,080
um learning from failure is one thing

677
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
but failing again repeatedly it shows

678
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,940
determination so Frankly Speaking the

679
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,080
more failures you have the more

680
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,120
determined you look

681
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,039
um I'm going to talk about the 90s a lot

682
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,900
if you ever if you ever get to talk to

683
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,580
me in person in lots of 90s movies in my

684
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,559
life uh one of them is Cool Runnings

685
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,020
who's in Cool Runnings from 1994. oh my

686
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,500
God fans I'm home anyway

687
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,360
um there we go perfect everybody's

688
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,559
involved

689
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,779
um so what happens is is that they cross

690
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:03,480
the finish line at the end spoilers

691
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,220
um but they carry they carry their

692
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,960
bobsled on their shoulders they don't

693
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,220
they don't get offended they don't get a

694
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,080
Podium finish they don't get a medal but

695
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,760
they get Applause they got a movie out

696
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
of it

697
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,740
they they're not good they're actively

698
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,900
bad for like 90 minutes and you and you

699
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,279
actually cry at the end because they're

700
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,380
because they finish because bias for

701
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
Action means something

702
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,039
these are all subtle subtle

703
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,960
um like signals that we send each other

704
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
subconsciously we can't undo this this

705
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,980
is where we're all hardwired in most

706
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,720
cultures

707
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,000
um let's talk about cronyism

708
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
it's really about Circles of trust

709
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
cronyism is negative because it involves

710
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,460
some exclusivity that's that's why it's

711
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,080
negative it's pushing people out not

712
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,580
just keeping people in

713
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,559
but here's the attack surface of it if

714
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
you consider cronyism an attack surface

715
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,860
this is what it looks like here's the

716
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,059
vulnerability

717
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,760
circles equals trust equals bias what

718
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,980
we're talking about is a circle of trust

719
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,720
and when you are inside that Circle of

720
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,159
trust you are naturally biased towards

721
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,779
other members of that Circle this is not

722
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,520
just cronyism this is families this is

723
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,580
friends this is professional everything

724
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,100
um the biases are not conscious once

725
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,840
you're vaguely in the in the vicinity of

726
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,460
the circle you're almost inside it

727
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,679
directly just being near it in the orbit

728
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,120
of the circle is generally close enough

729
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,520
to gain a minimum amount of trust on its

730
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,480
own

731
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,360
so that's you consider that the the

732
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,620
vulnerability the exploit in this

733
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,500
context is trust is a measure of time

734
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,799
plus exposure this is networking 101.

735
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,360
um literally everything comes back to

736
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,580
this circles open with time and exposure

737
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,140
so therefore

738
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,840
the the the the actual the actual attack

739
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,419
method on cronyism is to just be near it

740
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,640
long enough that you finally get in

741
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,559
but that takes too long I don't like

742
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,659
that no one likes that

743
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,000
so but countersignaling and bias for

744
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,580
Action they kind of they kind of Click

745
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,559
into each other and become a key to help

746
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,179
you get through that barrier faster

747
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,159
which we're going to talk about

748
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,260
what's gonna what's gonna kind of um

749
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,900
make this process go smoother are the

750
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,159
principles of influence I discussed

751
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
earlier reciprocity uh give some get

752
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,559
something and you'll give in return this

753
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,820
is why you get free samples at the

754
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,200
grocery store because they want you to

755
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,299
buy something you feel if you if you

756
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,980
have a soul which I'm assuming most do

757
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,020
not all but most

758
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,460
um You probably feel at least a little

759
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,960
bit bad about taking a sample with with

760
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,480
you know no intention of buying the

761
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,120
thing right like you kind of do unless

762
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,760
you're I mean there are people who don't

763
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,740
sometimes me but frequently you feel at

764
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,179
least a little bad

765
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,340
um likewise if I tell you that like I

766
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,080
fell off my Bice like if we're talking

767
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,279
one-on-one I tell you I fell off my

768
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,720
bicycle as a kid I hurt my shoulder real

769
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,159
bad and I can't lift my shoulder too

770
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,200
high now you're gonna feel like oh wow

771
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,539
that's why'd you tell me that Wes but

772
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,500
then you're gonna feel like you're going

773
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,400
to want to tell me something about you

774
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,919
in return that's a natural give and take

775
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,380
we we do as people as primates honestly

776
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,419
reciprocity

777
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,000
explaining your failures without any

778
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,120
burden of guilt or shame or hesitance

779
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,880
will give you a sense of not just not

780
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,679
just you know showing that you you're

781
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,120
willing to willing to work and you're

782
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,340
willing to fail but also you're opening

783
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,600
yourself up and that lets them open

784
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,919
themselves up too and that creates

785
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,840
connections connections which you can

786
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,100
use to break into cronyism a little

787
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,480
faster

788
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,980
social proof is the next piece of this

789
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,080
ideas are stronger in groups or with

790
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,460
backing of others

791
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,899
um are there any Psychopaths just cross

792
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:20,340
the street all the time without it

793
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,980
without milking I mean there we go

794
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,720
there's one there's always one in a room

795
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,059
this big there's at least one uh but you

796
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,460
find person you actually give permission

797
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,620
to all of us so

798
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,360
as soon as one person does it the rest

799
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,279
of us will try it right

800
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,659
that's how it is in a meeting room too

801
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,279
if you get into a meeting room and no

802
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,140
one says no to it you've just been

803
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,039
approved

804
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,899
so bear that in mind and then

805
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,460
likeability again I'm sorry I want to

806
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,260
give more topics to more more time to

807
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,820
that but you got to work on that too

808
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,220
being being a good communicator

809
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,779
um being a good listener and being able

810
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,179
to be you don't I mean people talk about

811
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,320
being persuasive you don't have to be

812
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,299
persuasive you just need to be a

813
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,620
be pleasant to talk to you know

814
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,779
so in any case let's talk about the

815
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:05,159
emotional energy we're trying to harness

816
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,860
here we've got two role models

817
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,500
Buzz Lightyear and uh Peter Gibbons

818
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,659
again I promise more I promise 90s

819
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:13,860
movies right

820
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,020
we're all about that here so Buzz

821
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,760
Lightyear I don't know how many how many

822
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
of you grew up grew up with it but uh

823
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,419
there's a scene where where woody

824
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,039
challenges Buzz to you know prove that

825
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,140
he can fly and he doesn't fly he falls

826
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,640
with style but he makes it look real

827
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,380
good

828
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,720
um Buzz Lightyear is cold it is

829
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,480
confidence bold and incompetent he is

830
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,539
very very capable of him in his own mind

831
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,799
um and he's reaching for things he

832
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,539
clearly should not be reaching for I

833
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,980
would not give him a gun or a pilot's

834
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,419
license

835
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:43,320
um

836
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,039
least of all at the same time uh Peter

837
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,539
Gibbons from off in space

838
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,700
um I would advise very very carefully

839
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,980
that while office space is very very

840
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,880
good to illustrate uh failing upwards uh

841
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,200
don't take the career advice from this

842
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,600
movie because he because he's he because

843
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,260
he he commits crimes but before he

844
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,820
commits crimes it's a great example of

845
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,679
failing upwards uh he's capable

846
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
charismatic underperformer he basically

847
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,679
just has a mental break at a certain

848
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,360
point and start and starts kicking down

849
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,940
cubicle walls so

850
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,860
um and then and then they want to give

851
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,980
him a promotion for it for not working

852
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,720
so that's that's the emotional energy

853
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,120
we're trying to harness here

854
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,580
um but before we dive into the steps on

855
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,140
how to fail upwards I just want to give

856
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,840
a little inside management heads uh any

857
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,580
managers managers in the room right now

858
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,279
there's there's a few good good glad to

859
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,799
hear it I'm feeling less alone now thank

860
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,720
you

861
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,580
um I think you're going to recognize

862
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,380
this space and that is that from the

863
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,880
management side

864
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,620
um I mentioned before there is no reason

865
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,600
to promote a good employee there just

866
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,820
isn't there is every reason to keep them

867
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,500
satisfied and productive in their

868
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,779
current Place uh you may get a pay raise

869
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,520
you may get Cliff Bars you may get PTO

870
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,600
but you're not going to get a job

871
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,960
improve a job increase on working hard

872
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,940
um personal story that I did not did not

873
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,340
share yet is my first paying job was a

874
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,159
cashier at a department store and at

875
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,659
that job I was like I'm gonna work hard

876
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,460
and get promoted

877
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
so I was the best cashier they had in

878
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,340
about three months and I asked for

879
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,720
promotion that and they said why would

880
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,740
we promote you you're the best cashier

881
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,640
we have

882
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,440
so so

883
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,720
there is no management and corporate

884
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,340
structures are incentivized to not

885
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,679
promote you based on the Merit or based

886
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,000
on the Merit of your work you've got to

887
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,679
you gotta color Outside the Lines if you

888
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,840
want to be promoted

889
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,480
and how you get how you demonstrate that

890
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,220
again management does not know what

891
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,840
they're hiring for most of the time they

892
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,220
have duties and tasks but they don't

893
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,600
know what qual how to describe the

894
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,640
qualities of management they look for

895
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,860
examples they look for real world

896
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,960
situations that they can draw upon to

897
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,480
say hey that's an example of management

898
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,159
the way you would the way you would

899
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,740
illustrate that is with contrast if you

900
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,480
want to truly give the give the

901
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,740
understanding that you're ready to move

902
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,679
up into management then you need to show

903
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,299
the difference from your current role

904
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,700
and failing up failing upwards indicates

905
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,000
in this context in a kind of drop here

906
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,679
and a rise here so the contrast is more

907
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,919
obvious does that make sense kinda okay

908
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,220
not everyone is asleep good to know okay

909
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,140
so that's kind of the background uh

910
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,940
we're almost there I promise because I

911
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,580
got some prerequisites for you sorry I

912
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,519
do compliance now so this matters

913
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,019
to fail upwards you're going to have to

914
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,240
get yourself in a very specific mindset

915
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,519
with like what you're going to try to

916
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,600
accomplish

917
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,760
nice to have as experience now what I

918
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,019
mean by that is nice to have experience

919
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,299
in management before you apply for it

920
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,240
not necessary it's nice uh but you

921
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,740
should have some background knowledge on

922
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,360
the type of work you're wanting to get

923
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,120
to so if it's like a you know you should

924
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,440
have some understanding of what the job

925
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,260
is like in a practical day-to-day sense

926
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,880
um but you but you need to have a goal

927
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,320
State you can't just do this without

928
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,260
having a goal you've got to have a goal

929
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,600
um I think the last hour before me was

930
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,940
all about that in fact

931
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,980
um nice to have as a startup mentality

932
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,840
treat yourself like a project treat

933
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,940
yourself like you like not not the job

934
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,620
not the not the company not the role

935
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,059
treat yourself as the thing you're

936
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:10,620
working to working to on leveling up

937
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,059
that'll help

938
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,519
uh but you should you should have a

939
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,899
willingness to work outside business

940
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,960
hours to to get that done

941
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,340
um it's going to be really hard to fit

942
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,659
that into a business day what I'm about

943
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:22,860
to describe

944
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,320
and you need to be good you need to be

945
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,880
less good at your current job and risk

946
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,860
it we all I mean we all whether we like

947
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,480
it or not we're defined by the work we

948
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,039
do we all have day jobs which we

949
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,220
identify as part of who we are and you

950
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,899
got to be willing to let your ego take a

951
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,059
bruise or two in the in service of your

952
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,399
greater goals

953
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,860
um and then the last the last nice to

954
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,299
have is friends and I places if you've

955
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,740
got a friend in management that

956
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,720
definitely is a very big deal that does

957
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,919
help

958
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,899
um but you should have acquaintances in

959
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,399
management they shouldn't at least know

960
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,500
your name you know that's the goals they

961
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,080
know your name they know what you do

962
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
um but you need to have a high place

963
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,220
with people in it to start with

964
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,960
um now why I say that is because I

965
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,700
actually had Consultants you know come

966
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,740
and ask me how to how do I get better at

967
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,720
my job with consultancy it's like I

968
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,700
don't know your management structure is

969
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,620
over there I have no idea how you rise

970
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,640
in that space

971
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
you have to you have to be this one this

972
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,600
process only truly serves people who are

973
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,659
in-house and working to rise in-house

974
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,679
so

975
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,000
with that said

976
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,419
oh okay um I still got time whatever

977
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,279
failing upwards phase one here's how we

978
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,299
do it

979
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,700
phase one is all about laying is all

980
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,440
about laying the groundwork for this for

981
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,820
the steps to come this one's a fairly

982
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,340
short list of steps in the Practical

983
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,559
steps it starts off with begin to power

984
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,140
down and what I mean by that is um if

985
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,519
you're an overachiever if you work

986
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,679
really hard at your job stop that

987
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:48,720
stop that right here right here is where

988
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,159
you stop working hard

989
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,440
I recognize so many Workaholics with the

990
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,320
nervous laughter right now

991
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,539
so many and if you know what if you're

992
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,159
already powered down good job you're way

993
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,100
ahead of the game keep at it

994
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,740
um this is I mean this meet your kpis

995
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,899
the employable do all the things you

996
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,280
need to do just don't be a superstar

997
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,980
anymore stop it right now

998
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
and next step right there is to immerse

999
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,579
yourself in the next steps culture so if

1000
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:17,099
it's management you're looking for go to

1001
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,139
um management meetups meetup.com for

1002
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,179
example has like these after hours like

1003
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,560
just groups of people who just hang out

1004
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,879
and discuss what concerns them are

1005
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,918
interested sometimes it's in a hotel bar

1006
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,659
sometimes it's in a hotel conference

1007
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:30,139
room sometimes it I mean stuff like that

1008
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,940
uh Tech conferences if you're trying to

1009
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,560
break and break in besides is great for

1010
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,839
that right so immerse yourself in the

1011
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,099
culture don't worry about the technical

1012
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,320
or professional skills just kind of get

1013
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,300
the lingo get the get the mental space

1014
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,219
of this

1015
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,780
um and then while you're in the process

1016
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,520
of improving yourself also work on your

1017
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
personal Charisma I can recommend for

1018
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,760
example a YouTube channel called

1019
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,379
Charisma on command

1020
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,079
goofy to think about working on how to

1021
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,879
network with people but I promise you

1022
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,079
that's actually what we're doing here

1023
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,240
mostly is just like we're going to be

1024
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,320
working people this is a social

1025
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,300
engineering space

1026
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,760
um so work on work on joint you know get

1027
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,200
good with the social engineering club

1028
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,579
get good with Charisma on command

1029
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,960
YouTube channel

1030
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,400
um I have tons of resources in the back

1031
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,700
of the slide deck so feel free to ask me

1032
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,380
Annoying questions about them because I

1033
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,880
want to discuss that that's so super

1034
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,140
important

1035
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,880
the goal with phase one though is you're

1036
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
employable but you're not a rising star

1037
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,780
yet

1038
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,900
phase two this is the hard yards this is

1039
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,000
where the work comes in

1040
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
um and this is also the longest point

1041
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,960
this can take months and this is

1042
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,960
extremely extremely relative to each

1043
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,640
individual

1044
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,380
um the first step first phase is super

1045
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,300
easy you know just just be better this

1046
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,040
step you start making moves it's going

1047
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,839
to be reliant on your ability to read

1048
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,820
the room and to read the space

1049
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,040
if you do this wrong then you run you

1050
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,720
run certain risks so be very very

1051
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,040
careful and only step where you're

1052
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,079
comfortable stepping

1053
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,480
quietly try to do the next thing without

1054
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,220
permission

1055
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,020
um you may not you may remember my

1056
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,460
personal story about when I built that

1057
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,200
infrastructure without permission well

1058
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,420
yeah that's an example

1059
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,339
um just do so in a way that is

1060
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,619
non-disruptive if you're breaking into

1061
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,060
management then do there are management

1062
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,040
tasks that do not need a manager to do

1063
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,740
them for example like maybe you can um

1064
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,960
help organize the Sprint calendar or

1065
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,700
maybe you can you know do some other

1066
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,200
like administrative tasks that the

1067
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,839
manager hates these are examples

1068
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,400
um but do the do them without permission

1069
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,900
but it's really critical right here and

1070
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,980
this is where this is where the mistakes

1071
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,200
come from and failing upwards

1072
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,200
don't make noise about it

1073
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,240
don't make noise about it don't be loud

1074
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,800
about it don't be proud about it don't

1075
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,720
share this with your boss don't be don't

1076
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,099
socialize that you're doing all this

1077
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,780
extra work that makes you a good

1078
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,820
employee that does not make you a rising

1079
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,960
star that makes you a good employee they

1080
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,579
go in the extra yard you're going to get

1081
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,140
an extra four percent bonus on your on

1082
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,420
your paycheck this this next year

1083
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,579
do it quietly here that time will come

1084
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:57,660
that time is phase three spoilers

1085
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,400
make yourself familiar with the next

1086
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,500
steps peer group and and to the

1087
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,960
management so make sure if if you don't

1088
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,579
if you don't already have connections

1089
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:08,400
inside the Inner Circle you're trying to

1090
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,440
penetrate that's where you start making

1091
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
yourself familiar with them that's where

1092
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
they need to be familiar with you and

1093
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,820
the goal is that they're familiar with

1094
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,320
you they know your name they know your

1095
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,640
job they don't know what you had for

1096
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,780
dinner and they don't and they're not

1097
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,400
necessarily friends but they at least

1098
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,020
know who you are because that's going to

1099
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,760
come in handy later

1100
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
and then here's where you start doing

1101
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,020
more and more of the next job after

1102
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,760
after the step one part you're going to

1103
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
be working towards increasing and

1104
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,119
increasing and increasing the amount of

1105
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,320
work you're doing that's not your job

1106
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,660
and while you're doing that don't burn

1107
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,099
out

1108
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,740
don't burn out and let go of the things

1109
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,119
of some of the things that are less

1110
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,680
important in your in your paying job

1111
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,140
that you're doing now

1112
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,339
so

1113
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,960
phase two goal

1114
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,820
is if you're doing this right over time

1115
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,740
everyone just feels like you're doing a

1116
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,020
better job over here than over there you

1117
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,260
know present job is it's okay it's okay

1118
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,460
but you're doing some doing some

1119
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,020
interesting stuff over here that's the

1120
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,400
goal

1121
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,640
make a sense so far okay good good

1122
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,560
so phase three

1123
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,359
this is where this is where it gets real

1124
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,859
real

1125
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,540
this is where it gets awkward

1126
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,099
so

1127
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,900
do not begin phase three until everyone

1128
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,520
is comfortable and confident in your

1129
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,920
space if you're doing job here and job

1130
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,260
here and no one's mad

1131
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,980
then you're ready

1132
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,339
um and also you need to commit yourself

1133
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,680
too just be entirely clear

1134
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,300
so here's here's the point of no return

1135
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,520
step one invite yourself or Shadow

1136
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,380
someone into conversations or meetings

1137
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,180
you are not invited to

1138
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,640
if this can be as simple as I can give a

1139
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,500
personal example it's my I only know my

1140
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,119
own story right

1141
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:42,720
um

1142
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,079
an example would be like uh you're a

1143
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,000
technical person and you need to provide

1144
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,560
technical feedback on a budget

1145
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,420
discussion you don't belong you're not

1146
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,920
you're not just you're not a CFO you're

1147
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,119
not a you're not you're not in a

1148
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,940
financial comptroller so you're not

1149
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,079
you're why are you there well you're

1150
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,540
there as a subject matter expert

1151
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,099
but why but what if you actually want to

1152
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,300
break into Finance

1153
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,359
do both so that's an example what I'm

1154
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,099
talking about get into these meetings

1155
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,000
one two go slow go carefully just Shadow

1156
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,220
someone and just walk in with them

1157
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,320
and when you do this

1158
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,640
um if you've done if you've done phase

1159
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,079
two correctly

1160
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,599
No One's Gonna Be noisy about this No

1161
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,800
One's Gonna No One's Gonna be upset

1162
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,980
about this and by doing this you're

1163
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,200
getting the social proof because as soon

1164
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,480
as you go through one meeting just one

1165
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,300
without anybody complaining they have

1166
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,220
approved you whether they mean to or not

1167
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,180
they have approved you

1168
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,680
you penetrate the circle now you begin

1169
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,720
doing less of the current role and more

1170
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,460
of the next one because you have because

1171
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,839
at this point you've actually gotten

1172
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,700
inside that Circle of trust because you

1173
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,020
put because you've been working quietly

1174
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,400
over here I told you quietly it was

1175
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,540
going to be useful right here's where

1176
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,280
it's useful you've been working quietly

1177
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,660
over here that everyone just assumes you

1178
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,099
should be in the meeting now

1179
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,720
now you're in these meetings by default

1180
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,940
now at this point you can start doing

1181
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,680
you can start missing your kpis you can

1182
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,119
start missing your indicate your

1183
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,160
performance indicators and who cares

1184
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,020
about your annual review now at this

1185
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,819
point you're doing two jobs they're

1186
00:40:08,819 --> 00:40:10,920
going to measure you on two jobs no

1187
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,599
they're not it's not about your job

1188
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,920
anymore it's about your paycheck that's

1189
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,160
different

1190
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,420
here's where you ex but here here's

1191
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,099
where you create some carefully

1192
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,619
constructed noise express interest and

1193
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,839
intent to move upward to that inner

1194
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,900
circle you've just joined by default so

1195
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,339
you're in these meetings now you're

1196
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,440
doing this work now and here's we say

1197
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,700
you know what I'm just really liking

1198
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,980
this team can I join just you know can I

1199
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,440
can I can I be part of the clubhouse and

1200
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,520
one or two things is going to happen

1201
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,440
they're either going to talk amongst

1202
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,819
themselves or they're going to send you

1203
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,319
to HR

1204
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,020
and HR is the bad HR is not success HR

1205
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,520
is what failure looks like the bad

1206
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,099
failure not the good failure so

1207
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,079
that's because if you've done phase two

1208
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,599
correctly then phase in phase three at

1209
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,060
this point you should be able to see

1210
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,920
them think it over should be able to see

1211
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,260
them work out like how you would fit and

1212
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,300
what you would do and what and if you've

1213
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,339
got a clear plan on what role to take

1214
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,380
just give them details on what you want

1215
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,720
and what you would do explain how you

1216
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,460
would do this if they ask they will ask

1217
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,500
if they care and if you're in the circle

1218
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,079
trust that you say you are

1219
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,480
but here but you gotta wait you gotta

1220
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,339
wait and let them let them come to a

1221
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,140
decision and when they come to that

1222
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,760
decision they're either going to they're

1223
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,859
either going to give you some informal

1224
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,839
interview or a straight up job if you've

1225
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,579
done it really well

1226
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,440
um but they might also decide no talk to

1227
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,079
HR at that point start applying

1228
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,280
elsewhere

1229
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,780
now I think we've all been in the

1230
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,680
position

1231
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,940
maybe not you I think you're a little

1232
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,099
too young to apply for jobs yet you

1233
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,140
might have views to go but most people

1234
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,599
in this room have had to change jobs uh

1235
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,540
at a certain point that they will come

1236
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,140
um

1237
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,420
and when you do you're always like

1238
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,400
um why did you change jobs well we all

1239
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,380
have different reasons here's one I've

1240
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,180
been working at this I have this job I

1241
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,859
want to do and I've been doing it for

1242
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,380
six months and I'm and they don't have a

1243
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,060
role for me now so now I'm looking

1244
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,859
elsewhere it's a natural progression

1245
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,140
into that role whether you whether you

1246
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,960
have done it on paper or not you now

1247
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,300
have the skill set and and talent and

1248
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,760
frankly drive to go do the job for

1249
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,859
somewhere else and they should know that

1250
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:19,079
they should absolutely know that

1251
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,660
so either they're going to keep you or

1252
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,880
not keep you based on that

1253
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,500
so

1254
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,079
phase three goal is you you're better at

1255
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,060
you you're better in this you're better

1256
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,640
in this work and we'll do it here or

1257
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,720
elsewhere you're going to do it one way

1258
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,640
or the other you want you want you can

1259
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,220
pay me and save a lot of time and effort

1260
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,960
you know or someone else will pay me and

1261
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,140
you'll have to replace two jobs now

1262
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,400
so

1263
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,040
with that said those are the phases and

1264
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,839
it goes by kind of fast I wanted to give

1265
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,819
this most of my attention

1266
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,079
um there's going to be questions but I

1267
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,339
just want to do a quick summary real

1268
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,020
quick

1269
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,060
um failing upwards is commonplace might

1270
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,440
as well work for you literally happens

1271
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,940
every day we all have bosses that are

1272
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,859
doing this now

1273
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,540
um it can ha it happens generally from a

1274
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,339
combo of normal human behavior which we

1275
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,680
frankly can't avoid from doing the

1276
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,640
reason why it happens everywhere is

1277
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,980
because it's Human Nature

1278
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,619
um and you can do it yourself if you are

1279
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:15,359
familiar with some social engineering

1280
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,520
tactics and a few specific social cues

1281
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
that will guide you into that process

1282
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,500
and also disclaimer used it is extremely

1283
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,300
personal experience if your story is

1284
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,560
going to be different from mine but this

1285
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,560
is just what I've seen work for others

1286
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,359
and uh yeah don't come in don't come in

1287
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,920
on Saturday and fall with style I had to

1288
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,720
be glib at the end I'm sorry I'm sorry

1289
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,000
guys I I I wanted a better joke it's

1290
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,700
best I could find short notice

1291
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,140
um I promised you a lot too many

1292
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,760
resources

1293
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,140
um feel free to screen cap this for

1294
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,480
those on those on the internet

00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,700
um I will share this presentation with

1296

1313
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,099
expert

1314
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,020
follow this man stalk him on the

1315
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,520
internet read his books he's incredible

1316
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,680
uh things like where people's feet are

1317
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,000
pointing and help you understand when

1318
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,920
you can talk and when you shouldn't

1319
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,720
stuff like that

1320
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,520
um influence the psychology of

1321
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,319
persuasion six principles of influence

1322
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,119
that are used for literally every part

1323
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,520
of success and uh yeah I'm down there in

1324
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,440
the bottom right that's me

1325
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,300
um I'm on LinkedIn sometimes I usually

1326
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,000
just post memes from Twitter on LinkedIn

1327
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,980
that's kind of what I do I think I gave

1328
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,940
myself something stupid like the

1329
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,619
Tactical CSO

1330
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,300
um as a title

1331
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,339
and I know I'm out of time but other

1332
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,700
questions am I out of time

1333
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,720
oh I got time

1334
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,300
realize that we do have a virtual

1335
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,300
audience as well so that's true

1336
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:26,579
did yes

1337
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,880
happy too happy too

1338
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,380
I'm not leaving this Podium until I get

1339
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,000
one good question okay

1340
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,070
[Music]

1341
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,300
oh

1342
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,040
that's a really good question that's a

1343
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,300
really good question the question is how

1344
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,460
long do you wait in phase two with uh

1345
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,380
holding that like manager workload

1346
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,800
without without manager title so in that

1347
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,140
so that's a that's a really that's what

1348
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,400
I was talking about with being a really

1349
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
really personal experience with failing

1350
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,640
upwards because for my story because

1351
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,380
again my privilege I probably got it too

1352
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,760
quick

1353
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,160
um but in my case

1354
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,300
um it was a period of I think about

1355
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,000
nearly six or eight months

1356
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,160
um it can go slow or can go fast it

1357
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,560
depends on who you know

1358
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,700
um how comfortable you are with the

1359
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,200
organization how formal the organization

1360
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,400
is

1361
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,560
um it depends on like uh how many

1362
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,119
stakeholders are involved in the role

1363
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,560
that you're seeking for example if it's

1364
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,380
like got like a finance and and all and

1365
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,540
regulatory requirements those then

1366
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,020
suddenly it's a lot more complicated so

1367
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,240
um it can and all and then I mentioned

1368
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
body language a lot I mentioned reading

1369
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,440
people and social engineering uh skill

1370
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,520
sets

1371
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,920
being able to know when to speak to

1372
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,300
people and when not to speak to people

1373
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,579
and to what degree it can push is going

1374
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,500
to be critical to how how quickly that

1375
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,359
process goes so it's going to be months

1376
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:52,140
expect months but uh how you can't

1377
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,119
really overdo that stuff

1378
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,380
um because if you do if you if you're in

1379
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,819
that step too long it just means that it

1380
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:57,839
just means you need to start looking you

1381
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,099
just go straight to the next job when

1382
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,240
because they haven't given you it

1383
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,079
already

1384
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,020
so cool that's a good question

1385
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,220
who's done yes

1386
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,459
[Music]

1387
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,319
I'll be honest with you I'll be honest

1388
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:20,400
with you I'm having a really hard time

1389
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,780
hearing you can you can you stand up

1390
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,099
mask off and speak louder please

1391
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,020
oh that is that is an extremely good

1392
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,260
question how do you do this remotely

1393
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,700
so

1394
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,339
point I actually did this remotely

1395
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,140
um so my so my story is actually a

1396
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,119
remote a story that I got through remote

1397
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,380
now

1398
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,040
um

1399
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,380
that's harder that's a lot harder um

1400
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,900
establishing Rapport over remote over

1401
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,720
remote sessions is the challenge

1402
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,700
um a cup a couple quick couple quick

1403
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,740
tips just to kind of help that process

1404
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,059
along I can give you a couple of things

1405
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:08,880
right now for one is everyone sits like

1406
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,440
this

1407
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,960
don't do that sit sideways a little bit

1408
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,520
because it's actually it's because it's

1409
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,260
less confronting it's already just your

1410
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,119
body position while you're on webcam

1411
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,400
will actually help put the all put the

1412
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,839
audience at ease whether that's a

1413
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,859
stakeholder whether that's just a

1414
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,680
one-on-one just just work on your body

1415
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,440
posture to help increase the level of

1416
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,599
Rapport but

1417
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:31,859
um additionally that's why this that's

1418
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,900
why the um principles of the principles

1419
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,339
of influence are in the slide deck

1420
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:37,680
because you have to get that reciprocity

1421
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,119
you have to get that give and take

1422
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,040
because that's how you because the goal

1423
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,800
is to penetrate that inner circle right

1424
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,099
so you do that by establishing rapport

1425
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:48,900
and you establish a give and take

1426
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,819
relationship which you do with you know

1427
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,440
explaining like you know your personal

1428
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,760
failures how I've done this I've done

1429
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,260
this it didn't work but man I learned a

1430
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,480
lot you know and then they're going to

1431
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,859
want to feel to do the same and that

1432
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,660
just takes it just takes longer but you

1433
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,800
got to work on that you got to work on

1434
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,780
the on the social on the under on your

1435
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,220
presence on webcam will help a lot

1436
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,280
yeah

1437
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,920
excellent that's a great question what

1438
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,640
other questions are there

1439
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,900
oh back there yes

1440
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,940
oh that's a good one okay okay the

1441
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,680
question is how do get sorry can you

1442
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,460
repeat one more time for me

1443
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,280
okay I need I need I need the so how do

1444
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,660
you get how do you overcome the barrier

1445
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,280
of I need to know you can do this before

1446
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,760
you can do this okay so that's where

1447
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,920
phase two is largely built on is the

1448
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,300
idea that you're demonstrating these

1449
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,160
skills that are either direct or related

1450
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,859
to that that threshold if uh if you're

1451
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,720
getting that barrier over a period of

1452
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,940
time if you're in phase two so long like

1453
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,540
maybe too long and they're and someone's

1454
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,859
saying I need you I need I need you to I

1455
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,480
need to see this before you get this it

1456
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,040
means you've jumped the gut it means you

1457
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,900
it means you've asked too soon this is

1458
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,400
where you this where you keep keep it on

1459
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,540
the download that you're doing all this

1460
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,859
stuff you just quietly do that because

1461
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,359
you let the expectations build around

1462
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:15,240
you you let your Legend grow

1463
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,040
the goal is that you're actually you're

1464
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,260
telling people that you're not telling

1465
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,339
people that you want the job you're

1466
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,040
showing them and once you've done it

1467
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,240
quite once you've done it and everyone

1468
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
expects you to do this job then when you

1469
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,160
ask it's organic so that's a good point

1470
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,040
[Music]

1471
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
s

1472
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,099
that is not only technical skills but

1473
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,520
people skills leadership skills and you

1474
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,619
are going to get more challenged being

1475
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,960
involved in a conference of this size

1476
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,880
that

1477
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,700
skills build your network and then you

1478
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,280
can say oh by the way this last weekend

1479
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,280
I ran the knock and someone goes you ran

1480
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,780
a knock I didn't know you could do that

1481
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,880
or something like that so do not

1482
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,880
Overlook volunteering opportunities as

1483
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,680
in your career development very good

1484
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,760
very good that's exactly what I'm

1485
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,500
talking about with um getting getting

1486
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,480
getting immersed in the culture of that

1487
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,280
job this is exactly how you do it as the

1488
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,599
volunteer opportunities it's a good

1489
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:25,800
point

1490
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,020
excellent excellent what other questions

1491
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,980
are there

1492
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,140
anything else on mind another one

1493
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,920
perfect hit me

1494
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,480
oh breaking

1495
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,680
oh

1496
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,480
like okay so the question is how do you

1497
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,220
modify this process for changing

1498
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,440
laterally into a different field okay

1499
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,740
okay so the process is I gotta admit

1500
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,240
that I kind of gave that disclaimer

1501
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,559
earlier that this process doesn't work

1502
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,599
as well for that but there are there are

1503
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,400
principles you can use for it

1504
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,599
um it comes back down to how to

1505
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,880
penetrate that inner circle uh that's

1506
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,220
that still applies the same way

1507
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,020
but even but in that case if it's an

1508
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,599
entirely New Field and you have zero

1509
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,780
zero experience in that field then it

1510
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,339
comes back down to the example like for

1511
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:13,079
example for um for volunteer work is a

1512
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:14,460
really good example things that kind of

1513
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,020
get you into the space where you can

1514
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,059
talk about it confidently like you're an

1515
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,319
expert

1516
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,240
you don't have to like demonstrate that

1517
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,800
you do the job you can just talk like

1518
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,180
you know what you're talking about just

1519
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,760
be really good at faking it

1520
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,680
um in a matter of speaking through

1521
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,940
through some extensive personal

1522
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,579
experience shall we say and once you can

1523
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:34,440
do that it can do that long enough then

1524
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,540
you can start quietly like just join the

1525
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,920
conversation at a certain point they're

1526
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,400
just gonna feel weird not to hire you so

1527
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,460
if I could just add to that

1528
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,740
you would not be surprised that you will

1529
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,359
be surprised at how many different

1530
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,300
Industries are represented at this

1531
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,260
conference

1532
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,839
Health Care Finance retail Hospitality

1533
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,660
networking within this industry through

1534
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,359
the conferences you would be surprised

1535
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,059
that you're working next to the

1536
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,819
you know for Bank of America or near the

1537
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,599
CFO of Health Care conglomerate

1538
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,660
building your network is another way of

1539
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,420
Crossing one industry to the other true

1540
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,800
story

1541
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,640
yeah perfect perfect okay yes another

1542
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,000
question

1543
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:33,079
I've watched those videos

1544
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,980
okay the question if I've got this right

1545
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,040
is uh I recommended some some resources

1546
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,319
Charisma command being one of them uh

1547
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,359
but the but doing the things that they

1548
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,000
show is hard is that right okay yeah

1549
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,079
doing is hard I completely agree so

1550
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,420
that that is that is where you have to

1551
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,619
be awkward

1552
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,000
um there is no substitute for that one

1553
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,700
unfortunately uh you gotta get weird you

1554
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,319
gotta get weird but if you treat it as

1555
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,720
getting weird instead of getting wrong

1556
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,940
then it suddenly becomes a game and if

1557
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,079
you treat it like a game you're just

1558
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,819
like you got no stakes in this right

1559
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:14,700
like who who's who's he I mean you're

1560
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,079
risking your ego but what are the real

1561
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,700
table Stakes of you going out and

1562
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,000
talking to someone you know I mean I

1563
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,440
mean there's there's always that there's

1564
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,660
always that joke it's like well if if uh

1565
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,460
if Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith can

1566
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,020
upload that computer virus to that alien

1567
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,220
Mothership then you can talk to that

1568
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,260
bartender you know

1569
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,940
that that's really what this is about

1570
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,359
you know I mean it's it the muscles are

1571
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,400
hard to hard to build but the good news

1572
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,160
is they don't fade nearly as quickly as

1573
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,140
others so

1574
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,059
you start slow my I mean you've heard

1575
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,319
this advice I know but I'm sorry I'm

1576
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,020
gonna repeat it you start slow you work

1577
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,280
carefully through what you're

1578
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,260
comfortable doing no more than you're

1579
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,299
comfortable doing but get a little

1580
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:56,160
uncomfortable as you go n plus one the

1581
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,540
whole way

1582
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,520
yeah good question there

1583
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,319
um did I answer that question okay okay

1584
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,359
that's a that's a that's a fuzzy one I

1585
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,920
like to make sure I'm clear on that

1586
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,440
anything else

1587
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,040
please

1588
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,520
watching all of the presentations in

1589
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,339
their hotel rooms 10 years ago

1590
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,619
so they first started watching the

1591
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:26,760
videos

1592
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,460
and then they came and folded t-shirt

1593
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,760
s and then they ran the Reds team

1594
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,220
and then they moved up to sponsor and

1595
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,960
then they moved up to someplace else to

1596
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,119
the point that they're all now at senior

1597
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,859
executive positions within the

1598
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,680
organization but then guess what they

1599
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,680
had the same parallel development within

1600
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,700
their jobs

1601
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,280
so getting off work with a bunch of

1602
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,559
people here who got weird

1603
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,900
usually helps I mean I'm in

1604
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,059
it really am yeah but

1605
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:58,559
you're coming here and being with your

1606
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,960
tribe of where your people is totally

1607
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,520
cool you got to make it weird

1608
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,559
you got to make it really weird

1609
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,819
like that's how this works
