what we're going to do here is I would

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,940
argue going to be an extension of what

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,880
was discussed this morning only we're

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,860

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,120
little bit we're not going to talk about

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,260

does does sneak in because we're talking

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,900
about critical infrastructure and

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,460
fundamentally our critical

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,460
infrastructures there's many

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,680
interdependencies in interaction amongst

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,239

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,500

thing I'd like to thank Mr Scott Alger

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,220
here's how today is going to go we're

127
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,500
gonna we're gonna we're gonna start it

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,479
at a certain level we're going to start

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,120
talking about examples of incident

130
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,720
response we're going to then move into a

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,300
discussion of risk and how to think

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,479
about risk because risk is hard and

133
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,300
generally as humans we don't ten we

134
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,639
don't naturally do a super good job of

135
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
thinking about our quantifying risk

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,419
we're then going to go through a number

137
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,100
of different critical infrastructure

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,120
sectors and talk about how stuff

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,880

incident response and I'm here today to

171
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,419
tell you about two real world incidents

172
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,460
that I have personally observed of

173
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,020
course given the nature of the

174
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,460
conversation that I'll be talking about

175
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,560
I can't tell you exactly who the clients

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,419
were but what I can't tell you is that

177
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,460
I've seen these incidents happen several

178
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,440
times before so be careful because they

179
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,060
could be coming to a network near you

180
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,979
the first incident I want to talk about

181
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,139
occurred in the cloud what actually

182
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,840
happened in this case was the client had

183
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,599
an admin account where MFA expired on it

184
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,060
due to a licensing issue and that

185
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,800
account actually happened to have an

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,860
extremely basic password that password

187
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
was also leaked onto GitHub if you're

188
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,599
not familiar with GitHub leaks they're

189
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,819
happening all the time so be careful to

190
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,860
keep your API keys and other sensitive

191
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,620
passwords safe and left out of your

192
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,419
GitHub code

193
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,339
the attacker was able to Garner access

194
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,099
into the admin account and once they got

195
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,320
into the cloud they started up spinning

196
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,920
up extremely powerful virtual machines

197
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,540
so if you don't already see where this

198
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,640
is going I'll give you a hint it has to

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,459
do with crypto if you're not familiar

200
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,839
with what's been happening in the cloud

201
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,880
lately especially in the context of

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
cyber security incidents a lot of

203
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,839
attackers nowadays are garnering access

204
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,540
to clouds and they're spinning up some

205
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
really beefy virtual machines to host

206
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,519
crypto mining operations the client at

207
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,620
the time probably had a spend of about a

208
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,680
thousand dollars per month and after the

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,779
attackers spun up these virtual machines

210
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,959
their climb their spend climbed up to

211
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,519
about fifty thousand dollars per month

212
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,380
so you do the math that's quite an

213
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,120
insane difference of forty nine thousand

214
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,740
dollars per month especially when you're

215
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
not expecting it

216
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,000
to remediate this it was obviously quite

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
simple changing out the past or taking

218
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
down the virtual machines opening a

219
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,920
ticket with the appropriate cloud

220
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,440
provider and basically Becky Mercy

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,540
saying hey I messed up can you help me

222
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,160
out here there's some fraud occurring

223
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,839
but this really could have been avoided

224
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,760
how could we have avoided it the things

225
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,980
I mentioned earlier being cautious what

226
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,320
comments you're making into your GitHub

227
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,720
repositories making sure that your MFA

228
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,000
is appropriately enabled keeping track

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,100
of your licensing for accounts these are

230
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,300
all really basic things but

231
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,620
unfortunately they're very easily

232
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,200
overlooked in the second incident I want

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,720
to talk about this also occurred in the

234
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,760
cloud however it wasn't about licensing

235
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,980
and it wasn't about MFA nor was it about

236
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,440
passwords it was actually about an NFP

237
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
group being incorrectly configured if

238
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,100
you're not familiar with the term NSG

239
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,959
that stands for Network Security Group

240
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,140
it's akin to an access control list on a

241
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,940
firewall but it's more applicable in the

242
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,220
cloud and unfortunately for this client

243
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,720
they left their NFC wide open

244
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,220
essentially allowing anyone to access

245
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,880
into their cloud and a researcher let's

246
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,820
call it that was able to get access to

247
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,100
the client's cloud and Garner a lot of

248
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,220
sensitive data that researcher if we

249
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,560
call it that reached out to the client

250
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,140
said hey I access you know several

251
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,060
hundred gigabytes of your sensitive data

252
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,180
within the cloud and if you don't make

253
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,640
XYZ remediation and containment steps by

254
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,140
this time frame I'm going to go to the

255
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,519
news and tell everyone about this

256
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,500
vulnerability that you have how you're

257
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,680
leaking all of this personal information

258
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,700
so again this could have been really

259
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,680
easily avoided it was actually found

260
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,839
that the client had done Showdown scans

261
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,000
earlier and known that the nfg group was

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,220
not properly configured however it can

263
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,740
be assumed due to

264
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,260
improper Staffing lack of resources and

265
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,420
honestly just human error overlooking

266
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,180
and correctly configured NSP that this

267
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
incident was allowed to happen if we

268
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,540
take a look at the oauth's top 10

269
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,180
reasons of incidents happening year over

270
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,980
year we're seeing that misconfigurations

271
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,899
are one of the largest reasons leading

272
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,820
to cyber security incidents why do

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,040
misconfigurations happen nine times out

274
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,380
of ten is because of human error so

275
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,640
those are two really interesting

276
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,680
incidents that I've seen happen quite

277
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,720
often in the cyber security field and

278
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
they're also incidents that have we just

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
taken some simple measures double

280
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
checked our work not had employees that

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
were burnt out overworked had someone

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
else to back them up and look over the

283
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,399
work they were doing these incidents

284
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,200
could have been easily avoided I hope

285
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,360
you enjoyed this information I'm finding

286
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,500
more and more incidents that are

287
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,880
happening just because of simple human

288
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,100
errors but the fact of the matter is the

289
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,440
real life and real world impact is huge

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,180
both of these incidents happen to

291
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,880
Fortune top 500 clients so to be honest

292
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,040
they could easily happen to you I hope

293
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,779
you have a great rest of your conference

294
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,820
and I'll see you next time bye

295
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,860
Meg

296
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,000
thank you thank

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you

298
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,399
okay you ready for me hang on

299
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,800
all right so uh I'm Lisa young I'm

300
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,240
excited to be here

301
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,380
and uh

302
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,760
correct I'm ready

303
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,399
okay cool all right so so I have this

304
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,560
talk that I give it's called all roads

305
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
lead to risk so I just crib these notes

306
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,740
from there so I didn't have to make a

307
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,540
whole new presentation so every time you

308
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,639
hear the word risk I want you to think

309
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,680
uncertainty we use the term risk

310
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
interchangeably with threat

311
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,240
vulnerability control asset you name it

312
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,399
so I'm here to challenge you all on your

313
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,440
language but the most important thing is

314
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,760
when people are concerned about

315
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,980
something that doesn't make it a risk so

316
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,420
I always say you should move on the

317
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,940
Continuum from areas of concern to

318
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,680
actually doing some analysis or

319
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,720
something and figuring out if it what's

320
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
exactly uncertain about what what the

321
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
situation or the condition or the threat

322
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,800
or whatever is the area of concern so

323
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
there's no part of an Enterprise

324
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,360
regardless of mission regardless of type

325
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,459
of organization that's not exposed to

326
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,560
some kind of risk and the type or

327
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,660
category of the risk might be different

328
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,139
but the workflow to identify assess or

329
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,480
analyze or take some action to respond

330
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,480
to risk is largely the same and you know

331
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,399
so for those of you who don't know if

332
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,959
you weren't in the last presentation I

333
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
serve on the board of directors for ISC

334
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,980
squared so if there's any disgruntled

335
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,839
people in the OR organization you can

336
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,279
talk to me because we're making some

337
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,380
serious changes to the organization and

338
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,420
I hope you see that

339
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,600
um but in in that role we identified the

340
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,940
top 10 skills that'll be needed in cyber

341
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,500
over the next 10 years and obviously

342
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,540
Cloud security data analysis malware

343
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,040
analysis all those things are on there

344
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,380
coding programming all of those but risk

345
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,240
assessment risk management and the

346
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,300
ability to talk across and work across

347
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,820
silos right to actually translate the

348
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,220
things that we do in in technical terms

349
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,800
to business impact terms and I said this

350
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,440
last time and I'll say it again but uh

351
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,779
uh you know one of the reasons why the

352
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,399
covid task force which was up here

353
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,440
before if you missed it won an award is

354
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,240
not for all the good work we did which

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
we did a lot of good work but it's

356
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,540
because we made people who were in silos

357
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,820
talk to one another right and I think

358
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,620
that that's going to become really more

359
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,199
important as we go go through this uh

360
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,839
this everything that's going on in our

361
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,240
world next slide please

362
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,320
so uh when I I actually you know use the

363
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
word digital I don't really use the word

364
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,620
cyber much because I don't think it has

365
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,699
a lot of meaning

366
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,920
um so I actually have a master's in

367
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,139
public policy and one of the

368
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,199
um one of the exercises we had to do I

369
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,279
went to the University of Maryland one

370
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,839
of the exercises we had to do was Define

371
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,060
cyberspace cyber security and all those

372
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,940
terms as related to public policy so I'm

373
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,920
not really fond of the word cyber but it

374
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,260
does get all the money so the but the

375
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,880
problem is is that if you all know the

376
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,339
OSI model it's all ones and zeros anyway

377
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,980
I'm a telecom engineer so you know the

378
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,440
whole point is that digital is pervasive

379
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
and this whole notion of cyber physical

380
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,579
what it's being called now cyber

381
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,740
physical systems safety systems cyber

382
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,839
physical so I like to think of the word

383
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,240
digital and building digital trust right

384
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,540
and so this just is a graphic I crib

385
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,040
from the Masters program the University

386
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,959
of California at Irvine and they do a

387
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,120
cyber physical systems but it's also

388
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,980
referred to which you'll hear throughout

389
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,660
this conversation I do a lot of work in

390
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,160
critical infrastructure I just recently

391
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,680
did an assessment for a water company in

392
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,500
another country that was deploying a

393
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,560
thousand iot sensors to to understand

394
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,540
what was in their infrastructure right

395
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,639
so you can imagine where this all goes

396
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,399
so the point here is that you know these

397
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,100
things are tightly coupled to all of the

398
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,220
systems upon which we rely and you know

399
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,320
use in our daily lives the other thing

400
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,120
is I happen to be privileged enough to

401
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,940
own a spa in my backyard and I fill it

402
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,740
up every few months I mean you know you

403
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,480
drain it you fill it up it's not like a

404
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,139
pool

405
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,940
and I've noticed because you know the

406
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,440
chlorine shortage right there's no more

407
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
chlorine in my water

408
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,339
um uh so when I fill up the pool I have

409
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,199
to add additional chemicals now when I

410
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,779
read their monthly water report it tells

411
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,639
me that they've gone to bromine but we

412
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,560
don't exactly know if it does the same

413
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,060
thing as chlorine so I'm just telling

414
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,380
you this because there's things that

415
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,699
slip through the cracks that we don't

416
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,800
always pay attention to

417
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,399
um okay so next slide please

418
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
so is there anything different about

419
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,940
cyber risk right

420
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,940
um you know cyber generally speaking in

421
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,759
the context here is it's of or relating

422
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,279
to computers digital infrastructure but

423
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,859
what um the difficulty is is that you

424
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,199
know our risk which I use just the

425
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,900
common dictionary definition of risk and

426
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,220
when you put those two things together

427
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,119
what it says is it typically involves

428
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,859
unauthorized access right so it's not

429
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,059
just the digital things the

430
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,619
misconfiguration the things that we're

431
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,419
concerned about but there's also this

432
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:24,179
element of unauthorized hackers right

433
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,859
unauthorized use of computer and

434
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,079
computer technology but what I want to

435
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,179
say here is that our risk increases

436
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,860
cyber risk whether you call it cyber

437
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,539
risk Digital Risk whatever you call it

438
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,840
it increases as our dependence on these

439
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,940
cyber physical systems actually

440
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,200
accelerates uh next slide please so this

441
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,480
is um I do a lot of content development

442
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,640
work for isaka so if you've seen the

443
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,020
risk I.T framework the risk it

444
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,520
practitioner's guide if you've seen the

445
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,760
risk I.T starter kit or the scenarios I

446
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,380
think we just released a few weeks ago

447
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,840
so I'm a futurist and so I like to build

448
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,640
scenarios for things that might happen

449
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,340
in the future and I use and they're

450
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,720
they're published now so they're freely

451
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,860
available

452
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,840
um uh eye socket just released a bunch

453
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,120
of them but basically the constructs of

454
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,340
how do you think about what could or

455
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,200
couldn't happen because one scenario

456
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,240
could have multiple outcomes in the

457
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,280
future right and how do we start

458
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,140
thinking about that as a way to get

459
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,600
senior leaders and decision makers more

460
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,640
information or more option more

461
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,440
optionality about what decisions they

462
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,660
should be making and so this is just a

463
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,820
high level risk management workflow

464
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,280
people spend a lot of time on assessing

465
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,919
controls assessing variety of things but

466
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,740
what they seem to miss in my judgment is

467
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,140
they miss the identification what are

468
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,059
the things that are pertinent to us

469
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,220
depending on the type of organization we

470
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,559
are right because each of us has a

471
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,660
different Mission but the scenarios can

472
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,720
be used in every step of this workflow

473
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,520
um to you know every step of the risk

474
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
management process or workflow you can

475
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,240
get a better understanding of what

476
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,460
actions to take or what actions not to

477
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,220
take based on you know your workflow

478
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,260
next slide please

479
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,059
so I know this is a little complex side

480
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,860
normally it's a build but we don't do

481
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,140
builds here so the point here is that

482
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,660
this is the organizational context to

483
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,700
think about risk management so I'm going

484
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,220
to start from the organizational Mission

485
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,080
every single organization whether it's

486
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,000
for-profit non-profit business

487
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,820
government whatever it is has a reason

488
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,039
for being okay I did a lot of work over

489
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,340
many years ago helping the military you

490
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,440
know set up cyber sort of thinking about

491
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,940
cyber

492
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,700
um as a as a discipline in a domain and

493
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,080
when we think about the organizational

494
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,780
Mission we use business activities

495
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,400
whether you call them projects

496
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,980
initiatives workflow business activities

497
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,200
business processes productive activities

498
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,539
we use those in order to execute our

499
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,120
mission but those uh business processes

500
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,460
that we use are reliant upon assets

501
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,799
right and you can think of assets as

502
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,440
people Information Technology facilities

503
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,919
Supply chains supplies raw materials you

504
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,780
name it you need to Define what those

505
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,580
are for you you and what the critical

506
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,220
ones are to your business processes that

507
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,740
allow you to deliver your mission and

508
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,480
any of those assets people Information

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,700
Technology facilities Supply supply

510
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,280
chain we wrap our processes around them

511
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,900
we call them risk management processes

512
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,120
we may not call them that explicitly but

513
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,980
all the things in this box over here are

514
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,440
examples of things that we do to keep

515
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
those assets operating in their intended

516
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,419
condition so that we can continue to

517
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,220
carry out our initiatives whether those

518
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,900
initiatives are automated or manual

519
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,220
doesn't really matter

520
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,860
the point is the more we rely on the

521
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,720
Technologies which relies on the assets

522
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,840
we need to wrap them in a way that

523
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,760
allows them to continue to operate

524
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,299
regardless of what happened whether they

525
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,039
operate in a degraded state or anything

526
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,440
so that we can keep going now the

527
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,179
problem with many of these things in the

528
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,919
Box over here on the right hand side is

529
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
that they're all done individually

530
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,120
they're discrete efforts they don't

531
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,520
collaborate right and so one of the

532
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,919
things that we can do and should do is

533
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,039
to collaborate more across silos and

534
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,780
figure out how to collect data once use

535
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,640
it many times right for multiple

536
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,419
purposes so next slide please so this is

537
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,100
just another way to say that you know

538
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
risk identification and assessment uh

539
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,940
they have to help the organization

540
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,000
identify what is most important you know

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,039
what conditions and call them by their

542
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,280
proper language and then you know I

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,600
think you mentioned quantification I'm

544
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,580
not going to talk about it but you know

545
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm I'm not a probableist although I use

546
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
probable Theory to figure out in my

547
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,059
scenarios what could or could not

548
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,700
materialize but also I'm a big impact

549
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,679
person and um and you know it's

550
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,539
important to understand and talk to

551
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:46,860
Business Leaders in terms that they

552
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,200
understand about what the impact could

553
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
be from a degraded state or an asset

554
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,600
being taken out of service

555
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,340
uh next time

556
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,620
oh this is it oh well there you go okay

557
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,200
so uh then never mind I'm all done

558
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,940
that's all I wanted to say and we'll go

559
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,039
on to the next person now so I'm here if

560
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,480
you need to talk about any of this

561
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,740
anymore after

562
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,039
you're up next babe all right thank you

563
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,760
thank you

564
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,380
oh I look pretty good there yeah you

565
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,740
look great

566
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,299
um you got to get close to the motor

567
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,919
yeah so one thing

568
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:29,460
um

569
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,679
I just learned that I still had a toner

570
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,860
account

571
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
so don't send anything to that this is

572
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,559
my this is my connection to the world

573
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:38,539
now

574
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,780
I I have given up on social media

575
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,460
um so

576
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,740
well risk is the first word risk

577
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,200
identification no that one was mine okay

578
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm sorry there you go

579
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,059
so stuff is on fire

580
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,200
um so uh real quick uh what they uh what

581
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,539
David asked us to do and and I tried to

582
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,400
follow that and be a rule follower for

583
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
once

584
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,820
um so everybody's probably familiar with

585
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,700
a couple of the the most recent events

586
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,320
that have really thrust the the water

587
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,700
sector

588
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,559
um and when I speak to water I mean

589
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,840
Water and Wastewater to us it's the same

590
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,940
thing to you it might be very different

591
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,940
things but

592
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,799
the plants are the you know if you're

593
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,260
living Downstream of somebody else's

594
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,820
City you're drinking their Wastewater

595
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,980
sorry

596
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,320
um so

597
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,360
um so just so you know that so old smart

598
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,159
everybody was very familiar with because

599
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,320
it happened about the same time and the

600
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,600
colonial stuff and all those things

601
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,940
and and I'm not going to go into the

602
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,700
details you know some old machine was

603
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,159
sitting there and it was got left on and

604
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,860
somebody else accessed it and you know

605
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,140
blah blah blah blah and they they got a

606
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,360
hold of the the controls

607
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,240
um the one thing about OT is that I'm

608
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,159
sure most folks are aware you know just

609
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,320
getting into access doesn't really get

610
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,640
you anywhere you got to know what to do

611
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,320
with that

612
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,360
um so this particular person also knew

613
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,620
what to do with that once they got

614
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,260
access and they went over and started

615
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,659
controlling some some chemical infeeds

616
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,460
that were very bad

617
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,480
um

618
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,279
there's a whole host of problems with

619
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,960
that that

620
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,679
um

621
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
that aren't cyber security related

622
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,580
um and so I I struggle with this concept

623
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,380
of you know everything's a cyber

624
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,380
security problem to to an asset owner

625
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,760
like water it's just one of thousands of

626
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,880
risks that we manage every day

627
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,880
and unfortunately the public doesn't

628
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,760
even understand what it costs to

629
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,880
generate the water that they get and we

630
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,620
are in a constant struggle you know you

631
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,380
try and raise your rate by five cents

632
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,240
and all of a sudden you know the world's

633
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,840
on fire

634
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,179
but most most water utilities are not um

635
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,100
even covering their costs to produce the

636
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,679
product that they're selling and another

637
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,240
thing that most folks don't understand

638
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,299
is most water utilities are the only

639
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,640
Revenue generating

640
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,240
um true Revenue generating uh entity

641
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,700
within a city everything else is tax

642
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,960
based

643
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,779
water utilities Wastewater utilities are

644
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,760
Revenue based they send you a bill you

645
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,640
pay the bill so they're also the ones

646
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,500
that's that can get rated when the

647
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,720
city's not doing very well

648
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
um so anyway there's a lot of things

649
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,679
working against the water utility

650
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,900
in this case it was a simple issue you

651
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,880
know they left the machine on from some

652
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
startup a decade ago

653
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,059
um so you know was this really a cyber

654
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,720
security issue was it a people issue

655
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,520
why did that machine get left there

656
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,159
where is the process is in place to go

657
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,720
around and ensure those things are taken

658
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,100
care of

659
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,120
um so we you know my my view of the

660
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,500
world is a little bit different in that

661
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,480
that that there were a lot of other

662
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,580
things that failed and that's usually

663
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,080
what happens when these things fail

664
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,900
right it's not just one event it's a

665
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,260
Cascade of errors that occur in order to

666
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,419
cause a problem fortunately this

667
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,220
particular problem the operator happened

668
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,860
to be paying attention and caught it in

669
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,779
time

670
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,360
um the other one the Baltimore city

671
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,919
um ransomware

672
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,260
you know it it didn't affect any water

673
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,000
delivery at all

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
um it was a billion issue billing

675
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,840
systems issue which we're also going

676
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,120
through some major upgrades

677
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,020
um

678
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,419
you know same kind of right that some

679
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,860
person clicked on something they weren't

680
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,520
supposed to launched a whole attack so a

681
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,200
lot of issues out there that that are

682
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,779
being faced you know utilities are in a

683
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,220
unique spot where they have to be very

684
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
transparent with their users with their

685
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,360
clients

686
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,980
they're also a unique spot that that

687
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,419
specifically in the water sector

688
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,659
information is shared there's no

689
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,039
competition

690
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,220
so people share information all the time

691
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,559
best practices the Water Works

692
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,840
Association the water environment

693
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,179
associations the Wastewater side ins and

694
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,620
outs

695
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,299
um you know there's a lot of information

696
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,520
sharing and and um

697
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
past what's on fire if you could go to

698
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,720
the next slide there's some stuff that's

699
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,620
smoldering out there

700
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,580
um

701
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,120
public awareness is is

702
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,480
is a good thing and a bad thing so

703
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,059
you know now we've had these incidents

704
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,940
so now everybody wants the utility to

705
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,500
take money that they don't have and go

706
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,860
spend it to fix cyber issues so if the

707
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,220
board's agendas don't have cyber on them

708
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,500
then you know

709
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,960
uh turmoil occurs and things happen and

710
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,779
people are upset well you know we also

711
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,460
have to keep the plant running and we

712
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,840
probably need to replace a generator

713
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,399
that won't start to keep the plant

714
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,740
running during a power outage which is a

715
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,200
far more likely event from a risk

716
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
standpoint

717
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,000
than than a cyber incident so again it's

718
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,720
a it's a management issue for us

719
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,779
um and so public awareness also now has

720
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,760
elevated a lot of the work that's going

721
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,320
on here and why I'm excited to be a part

722
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,840
of this is that it's helping us get some

723
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,000
things pushed through which will then

724
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
Force some you know when you're when

725
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,000
you're in a situation it's it's one of

726
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,340
the few things that that we don't like

727
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,380
one's a consent decree we don't like it

728
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,940
but when it sure does open up the

729
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,000
checkbooks and allows us to get some

730
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,500
stuff done

731
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,120
so my utility friends are gonna like

732
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,919
that but it's true it's very true

733
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,299
um along with that then comes from

734
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,520
government regulations so

735
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,039
um you know we we focus a lot on the

736
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,080
quality of the drinking water

737
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,480
um uh that's our primary primary

738
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,580
objective is quality of your drinking

739
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,140
water everybody feels clean today right

740
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,760
you're welcome

741
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,440
so

742
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,720
um and again it's it's a lot like

743
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,279
electricity you know you flip the switch

744
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,140
on the lights come on

745
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
you know there are there are an

746
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,940
increasingly number of fewer people that

747
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,520
understand how that electricity gets to

748
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,039
the house how that water gets out and

749
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,899
and you know understanding how all this

750
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,480
stuff works together so hopefully these

751
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,220
camp we can get some campaigns going

752
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,220
that's a big work of the awwa

753
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,080
um there's some water as life campaigns

754
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,380
water one uh one water

755
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,340
um

756
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,440
no water no beer

757
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,500
um

758
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,140
it has been

759
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,880
um but essentially the you know the next

760
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,679
thing that's coming is is that the Fert

761
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,960
nerk ferc that is in the electric

762
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,899
utility is coming to water

763
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,700
you know water

764
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,100
applauds that bring it but you can't

765
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,380
apply it without also applying the

766
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,340
funding

767
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,080
we have a much bigger problem Beyond

768
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,760
cyber is that

769
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,460
um you know the the Flint Michigan's out

770
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,399
there you know there's a lot more of

771
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,620
that than there are of of this cyber

772
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,659
issue we've got a trillion dollar crisis

773
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,880
and it's all buried

774
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,720
nobody sees it so that was that report

775
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,179
was 2016 so that's probably 2 trillion

776
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,620
by now

777
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,140
um most utilities you know pipe is only

778
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,240
designed to be in the ground for 20

779
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,000
years 30 years 50 years most utilities

780
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,580
aren't replacing pipe fast enough to

781
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,580
ever catch up so we're still pulling

782
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,039
pipe that's wooden out of Baltimore

783
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,039
from the original piping it was in so

784
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,020
just think about that as we start

785
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,940
addressing this and then you've got the

786
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,760
problems in California that

787
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,799
do I really care about cyber when I

788
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,260
don't even have water

789
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,760
and then when you start to think about

790
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,159
it and say okay well I sell water

791
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,440
now I'm regulating and telling people

792
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,140
they have to use less water

793
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,600
well but I have to spend more money to

794
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
take care of that water and do cyber

795
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,860
security but my Revenue just reduced

796
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,840
because I'm requiring you to use less

797
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,139
water

798
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,539
costs the same whether you use a little

799
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,580
bit or a lot that costs me delivering it

800
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,740
to you is the same so there's a lot of

801
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,960
those challenges that we're up against

802
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,720
uh Workforce Development for us is um

803
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,360
you know the the gray the gray hairs The

804
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,620
Brain Drain

805
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,779
um what are the words there's a ton of

806
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,700
words out there for it the problem with

807
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,620
the utilities is it's as public sector

808
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,720
jobs they're not able to keep Pace with

809
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,700
the rapid changes in the market right so

810
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,019
they'll they're a great training ground

811
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:48,539
and people learn their their trade and

812
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,059
they're gone offer double salary right

813
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,220
now the good news is that with the

814
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,080
Millennials and and the Next Generation

815
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,760
there's a lot of social awareness and

816
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,679
social conscience there we've got the

817
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,380
game on that right we're making water

818
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,899
good for society

819
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,880
yeah

820
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,620
um funding for risk mitigation we talked

821
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,059
a little bit about that

822
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,220
um the other big one for us right now is

823
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,860
is the fallacy of cyber insurance I I

824
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,960
really wish

825
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,600
um that that would be regulated out

826
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,179
um and nobody would waste money on it

827
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,360
um you know all it takes is you to file

828
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,159
a claim their job is not to pay it

829
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,440
you're expecting that they that they cut

830
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,940
you covered

831
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,880
um so it falls back a lot where you know

832
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,860
the the boards and things are looking at

833
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,380
this differently the bottom line is if

834
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,559
if Europe had a known issue you know

835
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,080
you're not covered that as you will find

836
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,179
with most insurance

837
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,679
um go talk to your insurance broker

838
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,600
sometime and have a lovely conversation

839
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,340
about that

840
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,840
and we've got a huge issue with

841
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,399
technology obsolescence we were talking

842
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,140
a little bit earlier

843
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,659
um what's it you know that back in the

844
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,760
day that when the river caught fire that

845
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,740
initiated the Clean Water Act the Clean

846
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,419
Water Act then caused us to go around

847
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,059
and build a lot of concrete a lot of

848
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,320
that concrete

849
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,360
went along with that came a computer

850
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,100
control system that computer control

851
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,279
system is at the early age of Automation

852
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,140
and nobody really understood what they

853
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,019
did so they got a ton of automation had

854
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,720
no idea what to do with it and so very

855
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,240
few places actually did anything with it

856
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
it was never in the water industry

857
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
Automation and technology is not really

858
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,340
a an investment it's a it's a tool and

859
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,440
it's a necessity

860
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,899
Private Industry would never automate

861
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,279
something that didn't have any return on

862
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,500
investment the water industry has to

863
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,059
automate things whether they have a

864
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,919
return on investment or not

865
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,140
because of the quality and the safety

866
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,460
issues so

867
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,380
we have to we have to change that

868
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
thinking in the in the industry and

869
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,340
change that culture I've had a

870
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,320
conversation the other day with with

871
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,940
um you know everything's going to the

872
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,380
cloud Who

873
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,760
the

874
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,039
if if the people that are using the

875
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,620
cloud data can't understand how to use a

876
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,559
trend on my computer when it's local I

877
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,179
haven't helped them any by moving it to

878
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,440
the cloud

879
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,839
I haven't gained and I've added in fact

880
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,460
I've added risk because now they might

881
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,440
lose that the only source of data that

882
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,320
they had so there's there's just a lot

883
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,480
of that cultural change that that I see

884
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,000
being a 20-year Private Industry guy

885
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,300
making beer and drugs and cars and all

886
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,339
kinds of other stuff and moving into the

887
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:30,418
water sector

888
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,520
a lot of challenges that that we've

889
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,060
solved in gas and oil and electric

890
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,560
haven't they're they're looked at as

891
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,239
brand new problems in the water sector

892
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,800
and so there's a lot of a lot of

893
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,619
opportunity for sharing of information

894
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,918
um so I'm gonna settle it up at that and

895
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,440
uh thanks for having us out

896
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,440
foreign

897
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,859
thanks very much Dean I appreciate that

898
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:01,079
and when we talk about food

899
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,599
uh and food and egg

900
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,160
um I think you'll hear some common

901
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,000
themes where people say this is a new

902
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,560
problem we've never had this problem

903
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,420
before we've no one has thought about

904
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,040
this and that's what we're going to talk

905
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,200
about we're going to talk about food and

906
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,200
agricultural sector problems which are

907
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,160
well frankly their Legion uh there's a

908
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,300
lot of issues here so let me jump in

909
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,920
according to

910
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,260
the U.S government and sis specifically

911
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,320
2.1 million Farms over 900 000

912
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,720
restaurants over 200 000 registered

913
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,839
manufacturing processing and storage

914
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,000
facilities in these United States

915
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,099
food is a big deal in the United States

916
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,460
okay show of hands who had some food

917
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,740
today okay

918
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,520
yeah

919
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,680
so probably everybody or after you

920
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,720
showered

921
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,320
yes both and we should also ask who who

922
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,220
had water today but

923
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,160
um food is a big deal economically

924
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,960
20 approximately 20 of this nation's

925
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,000
economy is structured around food

926
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,700
growing it

927
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,859
uh harvesting it manufacturing

928
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,720
processing advertising delivery and the

929
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,859
last mile at the store so 20 of the of

930
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,960
the entire economies is a relatively big

931
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,040
deal

932
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,020
so what's going on are there any

933
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,560
problems yes there are problems stuff in

934
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,700
fact is on fire okay so let us talk let

935
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,460
us first start with concentration risk

936
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,980
now I would say on this picture we have

937
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,800
two examples of concentration our first

938
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,380
example of concentration is a nice

939
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,079
person who's who's thinking thinking

940
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,599
very concentrated thoughts that's the

941
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,160
good concentration there's a bad

942
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,380
concentration as well in the bad

943
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,359
concentration is

944
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,599
uh the glass in this case a magnifying

945
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,599
glass the Sun hits it starts a fire

946
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,900
that is where we are at with vendors and

947
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,900
vendors in the food space

948
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,060
so just a couple of really interesting

949
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,800
statistics

950
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,700
um overall only 15 cents one five cents

951
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,280
of every dollar that we spend in the

952
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,000
supermarket goes to Farmers what

953
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,099
15 cents so that means 85 cents goes

954
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,400
somewhere else uh processing uh

955
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,880
processing storage transportation and

956
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,859
marketing

957
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:52,920
but consolidation runs really deep four

958
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,380
firms or fewer controlled at least 50

959
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,079
percent of the market for if we take all

960
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,320
of the different elements of food

961
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,960
Dairy meat what have you

962
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,880
um

963
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,260
uh 50 percent of uh four few four firms

964
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,040
or fewer controlled over 50 percent of

965
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,740
each each of those sub pieces of food

966
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,260
for almost a third of shopping items the

967
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,420
top firms controlled 75 of market share

968
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,119
so there is very significant Market

969
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,960
concentration well okay what's the worst

970
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
thing that could happen

971
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,579
oh there's actually a lot of worse

972
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,440
things that could happen so in meat

973
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,000
specifically right now in today's world

974
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,180
there are four major companies that

975
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,520
control depending on on the specific

976
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,339
type of meat you want to talk about 55

977
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,740
to 85 percent of the market is

978
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,880
controlled by these four firms

979
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,839
um

980
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:56,820
the White House has accused these

981
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,800
companies of contributing to inflation

982
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,500
by Rising raising prices while

983
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,800
generating record profits what's really

984
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
interesting is that the U.S subsidiary

985
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,740
of Brazil's JBS South America which is

986
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,400
the world's largest meat supplier they

987
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,920
Pro they they alone that one company is

988
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,040
responsible for 20 of the meat

989
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,780
production in these United States of

990
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,680
America 20 one company no problem oh

991
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,740
there is a problem the problem is that

992
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,680
in late May of

993
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,339
2021 ransomware visited their firm

994
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,560
so all processing of all meat in both

995
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,820
United States and Australia stopped it

996
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,700
just it just full-on stopped and a lot

997
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,740
of a lot of Downstream uh impacts from

998
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,780
that especially if you're a farmer who

999
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,859
can't deliver uh your livestock to the

1000
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,839
slaughterhouse there are no pictures of

1001
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,240
slaughterhouses here only relatively

1002
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
happy animals who are about to go

1003
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,140
upstate to New York

1004
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,099
um

1005
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:08,940
JVS however ended up paying 11 million

1006
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,740
dollars in ransomware to the Cyber

1007
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,819
criminals a week after discovering the

1008
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:16,859
incursion

1009
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:18,240
so

1010
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,380
other examples of concentration here's

1011
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,859
one infant formula according to data

1012
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,280
compiled by the Allied market research

1013
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,920
these four companies control 90 percent

1014
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,859
that's nine zero percent

1015
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,160
of the U.S infant formula industry you

1016
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,380
see the names

1017
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,000
but there's one name in particular that

1018
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,460
really gets my attention

1019
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,960
um and that is the good people from

1020
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,819
Abbott nutrition

1021
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,020
so

1022
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,180
uh there are some challenges here

1023
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,819
between December 1st 2021 and March 3rd

1024
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:00,000
of this year 2022 the Food and Drug

1025
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
administ Administration received nine

1026
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,420
reports of infant deaths related to

1027
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,160
infant formula manufactured by Abbott

1028
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,700
nutrition in Sturgis Michigan

1029
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,040
so in February of this year February 22

1030
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,400
2022 Abbott voluntarily recalls powder

1031
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,099
formulas that were manufactured at that

1032
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,260
one plant

1033
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,599
so that one plant just it it stopped

1034
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,280
um

1035
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,240
uh I'll have you just so you're aware uh

1036
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,300
Abbott alone

1037
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,240
is responsible for about 40 percent of

1038
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,280
the infant formula in these United

1039
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,900
States of America

1040
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,619
half of their production how much half

1041
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,680
of their production in the United States

1042
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,260
comes from one plant

1043
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,780
one plant so

1044
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,800
20 so said another way 20 percent of all

1045
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
infant formula in these United States

1046
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,319
comes from this location and there's

1047
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,339
some infant formula that 100 of it comes

1048
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,079
from this location because at this

1049
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,819
location it makes other formulations

1050
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:21,180
that are available nowhere else

1051
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,960
um

1052
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,839
so let's let's walk through what happens

1053
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,720
so in February uh the recall happened

1054
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,760
and Abbott stop production they said

1055
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,740
okay we're gonna do a better job we're

1056
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,260
gonna get after this bacteria that is

1057
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,500
causing problems no admission to guilt

1058
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,440
um so they did that four months they

1059
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,260
were offline producing nothing

1060
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,920
um you see there the picture of military

1061
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,300
assets being used to transport formula

1062
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,940
from Europe into the United States

1063
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,740
because parents were desperate desperate

1064
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,140
because infants could not

1065
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,780
there was no there's no formula so this

1066
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,140
was this is a pretty terrible situation

1067
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,319
so early June Abbott resumes production

1068
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,180
cool

1069
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,700
um then what happens uh then the weather

1070
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,880
happens the weather happens and in June

1071
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,180
June 15th of this year a storm happens

1072
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,079
in beautiful Sturgis Michigan and Abbott

1073
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,460
gets water coming up through the floor

1074
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,780
and they got they got all kinds of

1075
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,000
problems in their Factory they stop

1076
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,980
production again

1077
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,619
and it takes them about three weeks to

1078
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,740
restore clean stuff out get it all going

1079
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,540
again but think about that think about

1080
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,540
four entities that have this control

1081
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,960
over infant formula which if you have an

1082
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,119
infant that cannot tolerate any other

1083
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,579
kind of food that is critical

1084
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,980
infrastructure to you no kidding I mean

1085
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,119
this is

1086
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,400
the definition of a life health safety

1087
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,599
issue for short

1088
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,380
um what else is going on in agriculture

1089
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,060
oh we should talk about agriculture we

1090
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,920
talked a little bit about food let us

1091
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,599
get to agriculture so

1092
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,880
um uh as the the good people at the FBI

1093
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,420
did Issue a warning and they sent out uh

1094
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,260
they sent out April April 20th this year

1095
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,500
FBI warns of ransomware attacks

1096
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,780
targeting U.S AG sector

1097
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,220
um in the interest of time I'm not going

1098
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,220
to go through these but uh this came out

1099
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,079
this is a super public there's four

1100
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,079
specific instances of attacks against

1101
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,800
food producers grain storage elevators

1102
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,500
Etc this is like a no kidding warning no

1103
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,599
kidding warning what that happened on

1104
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:51,119
April 20. nothing bad would ever happen

1105
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,000
after April 20th of this year

1106
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,040
oh but their bad things do happen oh how

1107
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,839
did this happen so

1108
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:03,480
um the nice people at fent

1109
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,980
um got ransomware on May 5th egg Co we

1110
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,099
can concentration concentration so AGCO

1111
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,099
that that's the name I'm not lying AGCO

1112
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,859
agriculture company uh they owned this

1113
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,540
big tractor company they own a lot of

1114
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,200
tractor companies they got ransomware

1115
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,500
um they've gone pretty quiet but it

1116
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,940
doesn't take it's not hard to understand

1117
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,099
the Practical implication of ransomware

1118
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,460
against a manufacturing facility that

1119
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,339
produces tractors can cause those

1120
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:40,619
tractors to not be available to the

1121
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,240
marketplace when the marketplace wants

1122
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,700
to do things like buy tractors fix

1123
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,940
tractors use tractors so this is an

1124
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,460
attack against agriculture critical

1125
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,819
infrastructure and

1126
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:57,060
it's an issue but there are other issues

1127
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,640
related to tractors now

1128
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,400
we all laughed uh and we were super

1129
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,160
happy when we saw pictures uh picture on

1130
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,099
the left of tractors Towing uh disabled

1131
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,440
Russian tanks in Ukraine we said yay

1132
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,880
that's great

1133
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,880
um but then we got sad for a second when

1134
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,780
we learned that Russians were stealing

1135
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,020
looting pillaging Ukraine in an

1136
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,000
unprovoked war and were stealing

1137
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,119
tractors so he said boo but then we

1138
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,300
heard that John Deere remotely disabled

1139
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,119
the tractors and then we said yay what

1140
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,180
we said yay for a minute

1141
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,920
just a minute

1142
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,079
and then we thought about it and then we

1143
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,540
said ooh yikes

1144
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,980
no

1145
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,960
I want to give a shout out

1146
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,599
he might be here in this room I don't

1147
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,000
know we did talk before this

1148
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,859
presentation

1149
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,400
and that is if there's one person that I

1150
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,579
would I would strongly recommend that

1151
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:01,740
um you follow you follow on the twitters

1152
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,420
and in in all the places is Mr sick

1153
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,099
codes

1154
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,780
um so big day big egg is Big Data and um

1155
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,420
I grabbed a lot of this information from

1156
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,180
him he's doing amazing work and I'm

1157
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,220
going to talk about uh his Defcon 30

1158
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,339
presentation a little bit but

1159
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,440
um in this picture you might see a

1160
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,180
tractor but do you know what that

1161
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,500
tractor is that is a data collection

1162
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,460
device it is collecting all of the data

1163
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,700
all of the time uh moisture uh uh it it

1164
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,160
collects everything about the production

1165
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,599
used in agriculture and

1166
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,020
um so you say okay well what's so bad

1167
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,579
about that

1168
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,720
yeah for all of the data from every John

1169
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,020
Deere tractor is being collected and

1170
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,319
stored in one place what could possibly

1171
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,500
go wrong oh right everything everything

1172
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,339
could go wrong because this data speaks

1173
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:14,579
to very precise operational impacts that

1174
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,280
are going on for a given farmer we

1175
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,440
talked earlier about I think it was 2.1

1176
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,300
million farms in these United States of

1177
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,200
America

1178
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,020
if there's one company that say given

1179
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,300
their Market I I don't know how big the

1180
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,700
John Deere Market is compared to others

1181
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,980
um my belief is that it's at least north

1182
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,619
of 40 percent probably higher than that

1183
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:37,559
but the good people at John Deere they

1184
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,040
have the data they have all of the data

1185
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,680
they got all the data

1186
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,640
now what happens if all that data is a

1187
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,760
sync is in a single portal

1188
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,180
would that represent a very nice Target

1189
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,400
for an adversary

1190
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,339
yes yes it would what could you do with

1191
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,619
that data you could you could do a bunch

1192
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:02,700
of things you could do things

1193
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,040
commercially like you could say

1194
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,559
tractor a does not belong to Bob it

1195
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,540
belongs to Robin and Robin's tractor

1196
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,400
belongs to Pat that'd be kind of a pain

1197
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,579
in the neck but you can issue a

1198
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,319
multi-year denial of service attack

1199
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,559
against one farmer or more than one

1200
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:22,579
farmer maybe a bunch of farmers maybe

1201
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:26,579
through a single portal you reprogram

1202
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,440
the tractor there is remote access

1203
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,440
involved related to this portal you

1204
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,220
reprogram that tractor to dump so much

1205
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,680
fertilizer in a certain area of the

1206
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,619
field that that field cannot grow crops

1207
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,140
again for decades

1208
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,660
that would be a bad day

1209
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,420
but here's the thing this this is the

1210
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,059
world that we live in and again you want

1211
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,020
to follow Mr sick codes because and and

1212
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,640
uh he's

1213
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,380
he's trying to be as responsible as he

1214
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,359
can he's telling the good people at John

1215
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:02,400
Deere some of the issues that they have

1216
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,559
for some reason they were not super

1217
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,140
interested in listening but he's he's

1218
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,839
working with um uh there's a lot of

1219
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,319
concentrated risk as it relates to

1220
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,660
um big egg and big data I don't want to

1221
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,400
I don't put all the blame on John Deere

1222
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,160
because basically every other uh tractor

1223
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,920
manufacturer is in the same game of

1224
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,680
collecting the data this relates to

1225
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,220
um uh carbon offsets uh production you

1226
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,040
think about in today's world uh corn is

1227
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,960
used for everything including food it's

1228
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,400
also used to create natural fuel biofuel

1229
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,099
a lot of issues related to Big

1230
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,680
agriculture

1231
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,280
um big eggs big risk this metallicy

1232
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,760
device is an example of a piece of

1233
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,760
communications Hardware that is in every

1234
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,819
or essentially every tractor which

1235
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,339
fundamentally is a data collection

1236
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:02,900
device that sending all that information

1237
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,900
back home and so here's the big reveal

1238
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,980
Saturday evening or Saturday

1239
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,740
sick codes is on the main stage talking

1240
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,960
about hacking the farm breaking badly

1241
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,599
into agricultural devices if you're at

1242
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,160
Defcon you definitely want to check that

1243
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,660
out

1244
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,540
okay oh uh there is an announcement here

1245
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,420
thank you

1246
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,819
so one of the one of the fabulous

1247
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:42,480
benefits of speaking at Defcon is you

1248
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,730
can make outrageous Pizza

1249
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,660
[Music]

1250
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,420
don't lose your cookies

1251
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,220
okay

1252
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,240
besides LV besides LV because besides LV

1253
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,400
is way cooler than Defcon because Defcon

1254
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,900
doesn't know how to do this

1255
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,900
uh is you can make outrageous requests

1256
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,300
and if you don't mispronounce the name

1257
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,700
of the conference that you're in they

1258
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,640
might accommodate you so

1259
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,660
I would like to welcome Mr bort to the

1260
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,720
floor to share with us

1261
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,558
your mic is right up there

1262
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,880
all right well thank you for giving me a

1263
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,650
low bar to meet in comparison David

1264
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:35,220
[Laughter]

1265
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,559
just jump over

1266
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,880
who knows what industrial control

1267
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,859
systems are

1268
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:42,059
right

1269
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:45,500
what is an industrial control system

1270
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,140
it has now been zero days since stuxnet

1271
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,540
has been mentioned thank you so that is

1272
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,420
that is the common perspective we need

1273
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,760
to understand that all too often in our

1274
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,520
industry we talk to the echo chamber of

1275
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,220
ourselves right not everybody is as

1276
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,160
smart and as good looking and as nice as

1277
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,480
Jen Ellis foreign

1278
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,339
right so

1279
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:15,660
who's got another answer for winning

1280
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,980
industrial control system is because

1281
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,599
that's not wrong that's actually

1282
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,940
literally what 95 of the world would

1283
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,020
probably say

1284
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,119
oh you got another one

1285
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,520
like the Tesla manufacturing floor

1286
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,020
Tesla manufacturing floor so

1287
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,700
manufacturing is a place where there are

1288
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,899
a lot of industrial control systems

1289
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,540
anything that controls life systems

1290
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,420
elevators

1291
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,599
cameras I like how you used the the name

1292
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,760
in it well it does controls right and

1293
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,460
that's part of it so the simplest way to

1294
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,800
think of an industrial control system is

1295
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,540
any computer that's at least 20 years

1296
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,160
old

1297
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,930
[Laughter]

1298
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,359
now unlike your random computers that

1299
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:01,859
you carry around with you or your pretty

1300
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,420
laptops

1301
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,140
these don't just focus on data

1302
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,599
these affect the physical world that's

1303
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,760
what we're controlling it's not just

1304
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,700
data it's physical impact

1305
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,379
and when we lose energy

1306
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,279
we go to the Stone Age immediately

1307
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:25,980
that's not me worrying about cyber

1308
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,359
insurance

1309
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,540
that's not me worrying about data

1310
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,460
that is we are Stone Age like that

1311
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,700
all right so it's not often that I get

1312
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,640
to actually say I was a primary source

1313
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,980
so two and a half years ago at RSA

1314
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,859
that's another conference than b-sides

1315
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:49,559
hahaha

1316
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,079
then director Chris Krebs and I were up

1317
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,760
on stage he was the cyber security

1318
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,099
infrastructure Security Agency they care

1319
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,660
about security so much it's in the name

1320
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,020
twice

1321
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,819
and we called the coming rash of

1322
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:04,559
ransomware ransomware had been around

1323
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,720
for a while but the difference was we

1324
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,779
painted it as a coming National crisis

1325
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:15,660
and as of 2021 just like when we think

1326
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,819
of industrial Control Systems from 2012

1327
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:21,319
we think of stuxnet ransomware in 2021

1328
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:24,480
became a kitchen word

1329
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,119
what I mean by that is it escapes the

1330
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,099
expert parlance of this is exactly what

1331
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,020
ransomware means it became something

1332
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,000
that was talked around the kitchen table

1333
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,240
because it actually affected your daily

1334
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,400
citizens life

1335
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,839
your average citizen does not think

1336
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,940
about cyber security

1337
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,859
in fact I would argue in your personal

1338
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,380
lives you rarely do as well you don't

1339
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,119
wake up and think about what am I

1340
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,760
cybering today except at my job

1341
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,540
right you think about shower

1342
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,440
thank you for the water

1343
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,460
you think about breakfast you think

1344
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,319
about your boss as an

1345
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:02,940
you think about your car right you think

1346
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,920
about all of these things this is not a

1347
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,680
top priority and so when we get

1348
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,299
and it's always for a bad reason but

1349
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,799
when we get that opportunity as a

1350
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,200
community because something is bad

1351
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,720
enough that it gets the attention that

1352
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,900
is our opportunity for change right I am

1353
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,760
the Cavalry has been pushing these ideas

1354
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,780
for years and I mean unfortunately it

1355
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,819
takes those kinds of big moments to make

1356
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:28,500
change going back to where we're talking

1357
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,900
about risk we as humans are terrible at

1358
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,339
understanding risk and what it actually

1359
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:34,740
means for ourselves which is why we all

1360
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,079
think well yeah that's bad but I got all

1361
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,700
these other things to worry about and

1362
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,400
until it happens I don't care

1363
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,940
so ransomware has now

1364
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,460
innovated right ransomware used to just

1365
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,980
be I just locked your computer right

1366
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,380
Saudi aramco all of their computers

1367
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,240
overnight paperweights now what's

1368
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,160
interesting about that is it did not

1369
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,380
directly affect any of the industrial

1370
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,240
control systems

1371
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,520
not a single one was affected

1372
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,559
but every single computer in the

1373
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,940
Enterprise Information Technology

1374
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,160
environment paperweight

1375
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,440
do you think that you can run your

1376
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,180
operational Technologies without your

1377
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,140
I.T

1378
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,700
nope

1379
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,940
so now they've expanded it not only am I

1380
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,380
going to lock your stuff but I'm going

1381
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,299
to exfiltrate it and then I'm going to

1382
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:24,059
use that as double extortion so pay me

1383
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:27,619
the Bounty for well Bounty sorry

1384
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:29,579
if you've been following any of the

1385
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,079
cryptocurrency stuff that's been the

1386
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,880
latest thing is hey we're going to call

1387
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,799
you white hat afterward if you return

1388
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,599
the money

1389
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,059
true story that's a that's a bounty that

1390
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:42,000
was why I was in my head no so hey The

1391
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,119
Ransom to get the decrypter to turn your

1392
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,280
data back on so you can operate

1393
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,099
and we won't release your stuff

1394
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,140
then they thought wait we can do even

1395
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,460
better than that because what do we get

1396
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,260
with your data well I get all of your

1397
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,760
customers and all of your vendors and

1398
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,140
all of your supply chain

1399
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,359
huh wonder if any of their data is in

1400
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:02,160
that

1401
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,380
I wonder if you not want them to know

1402
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,280
that

1403
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,380
and so that's the triple extortion now

1404
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,119
where I'm going to also Ransom that

1405
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,400
against all of the relationships that

1406
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,640
you have

1407
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,380
um so the question of this has always

1408
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,280
been almost all ransomware comes out of

1409
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,740
roughly Eastern Europe and Russia

1410
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,960
the great majority of it and the

1411
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,940
question has always been what is the

1412
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,920
alignment of clearly Russian

1413
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,920
intelligence military to that and for

1414
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,839
the most part there is no absolute

1415
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,460
Smoking Gun where somebody got caught

1416
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,680
with it being like in a direct handoff

1417
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,140
but there certainly was at a minimum a

1418
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:44,220
kind of wink wink will let you work here

1419
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,660
and that changed when we had the

1420
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,400
Ukrainian War

1421
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,020
so one of the big ransomware groups

1422
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,140
there Conti within one day of the attack

1423
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,900
came out publicly and said anybody that

1424
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,200
does anything against Russian computers

1425
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,680
we're going to attack you back

1426
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,480
furthermore as we discuss this in a

1427
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,500
later slide we're going to talk about

1428
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,619
how very curiously a lot of the

1429
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:10,020
ransomware targets tied directly to

1430
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,299
Russian national strategy

1431
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,559
huh

1432
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:15,000
turns out we're not really talking about

1433
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,640
this computer nerd are we

1434
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,559
because this stuff doesn't just exist on

1435
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:20,819
the realm of what we have to do for

1436
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:23,220
computer security it's the question of

1437
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,839
motives

1438
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:27,619
and why

1439
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,819
um and then we have also example of

1440
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:31,619
activists using ransomware in the biela

1441
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:33,180
Russian cyber partisans

1442
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,660
slide all right so why it's so important

1443
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,299
we don't call everything an attack

1444
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:41,160
have anybody ever seen those statistics

1445
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,020
where like we stopped 600 million

1446
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,799
attacks a second

1447
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,079
at the airport

1448
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:51,780
not a bulletin board when we landed in

1449
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,119
Vegas if you didn't see it you know

1450
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,160
which one which is the one we hate um

1451
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,000
dark Trace

1452
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,160
sorry I have opinions

1453
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,559
um and what they're doing is turns out

1454
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,640
that all of this interconnected stuff

1455
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,160
is constantly being swept by all sorts

1456
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,240
of different people who had written

1457
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,099
scripts to crawl it to touch and do that

1458
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,799
well when I touch a port and I touch

1459
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,240
that port and I'm enumerating the

1460
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,799
surface and touching that stuff they're

1461
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,900
calling those attacks

1462
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,200
well now go back to our industry our

1463
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,260
community problem of we've come across

1464
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,400
as The Boy Who Cried Wolf

1465
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,700
and so it's hard for society to tell the

1466
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,500
difference well you said 600 million

1467
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,940
attacks

1468
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,859
and I don't see any real problem with

1469
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:42,359
that

1470
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,400
so we have to be very careful with our

1471
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,359
language

1472
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,619
we have to think what's the difference

1473
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:48,839
between reconnaissance what's the

1474
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:50,819
difference between initial access and

1475
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:51,960
then what's the difference where I'm

1476
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,260
actually causing impact

1477
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,359
right Dean mentioned this earlier the

1478
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,460
difference between axis impact those are

1479
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,200
the two key attributes when we look at

1480
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,059
industrial control systems

1481
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,619
the other part tying it to it right

1482
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,619
everybody's familiar with the CIA Triad

1483
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:08,280
confidentiality integrity and

1484
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,619
availability

1485
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:12,000
availability is the biggest key in

1486
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,020
industrial control systems

1487
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,160
availability is the biggest key in

1488
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,900
industrial control systems

1489
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,980
I'm not doing it three times

1490
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,220
so we need to be careful about our

1491
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,140
language because it changes where people

1492
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,380
are going to be listening to us

1493
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,819
especially at b-sides

1494
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,640
where's your Bounty buddy

1495
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,440
all right so who's heard of the Purdue

1496
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,059
model

1497
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:46,559
I have okay the Purdue model is the de

1498
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,720
facto Enterprise architecture model that

1499
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,079
we use in industrial control systems

1500
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,260
and it's fooling you

1501
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,440
it was originally created to be able to

1502
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,359
establish the timing of these Control

1503
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:02,220
Systems so that I could get them to work

1504
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,319
and the problem is we looked at that

1505
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,599
from an I.T background and from a design

1506
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,940
and a security background and well like

1507
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,280
one two three four five I mean that's

1508
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,579
defense in depth right

1509
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:15,319
foreign

1510
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:17,460
it intuitively gives you that feeling

1511
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,660
doesn't it

1512
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,799
but here's the reality

1513
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,980
Pixar is uh what gonna be recruiting me

1514
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,079
so we have it we all understand I.T

1515
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,799
beachhead

1516
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:34,380
so like in the Florida water hack

1517
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,240
what they did is they accessed a human

1518
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,740
machine interface

1519
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,900
these are higher level machines that are

1520
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,059
there in these environments so that I

1521
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,319
don't have to literally run around to

1522
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:46,140
every sensor or control system I have a

1523
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,359
single map of them I can see what the

1524
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,039
state of those are and I can make

1525
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:52,980
modifications manually if I need to in

1526
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,280
the case of the Florida water hack the

1527
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,579
um the HMI they changed it so that the

1528
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:01,559
PLC stayed open the programmable logic

1529
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:03,480
controller stayed open and that

1530
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,920
increased the amount of lie that was

1531
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,720
going to be processed through the water

1532
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,379
at that point

1533
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,720
that PLC is at the bottom part that's

1534
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,099
the traditional operational technology

1535
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,740
these are relatively dumb devices

1536
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,539
they just do what they're told because

1537
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,220
all of the intelligence is being done up

1538
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,380
the beachhead that was a besides click

1539
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,700
please thank you

1540
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,859
oh forgot there's a theoretical air gap

1541
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:26,940
right

1542
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,920
has anybody ever actually seen an air

1543
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,480
gap yes

1544
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,819
you've seen a real air gap

1545
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:34,920
and maintained it and nothing ever

1546
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,980
crossed it ever ever ever ever ever not

1547
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,940
once

1548
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,520
exactly

1549
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,500
so an air gap is not an air gap is not

1550
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,180
an air gap

1551
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,280
um and there are lots I mean there are

1552
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,720
better ones or Worse ones but the

1553
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,880
reality is you always have to have a

1554
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,020
reason for something to touch something

1555
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,119
at some point

1556
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:56,700
and the challenge here is that the

1557
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,260
primary reason that we have in

1558
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,700
industrial Control Systems these

1559
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,440
connections well just think about what's

1560
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,240
the most logical thing right it ties to

1561
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,559
a lot of what he was saying about in

1562
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,460
water

1563
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,460
well it's the same thing in electricity

1564
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,579
what do I need to get from my what's

1565
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:12,900
happening in the operational environment

1566
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:17,000
that ties to business administration

1567
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:20,220
money Billy Money

1568
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,380
billing

1569
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,760
it's always going to be a need for

1570
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,559
billing

1571
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,359
so

1572
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:33,000
okay so this is the reality this is the

1573
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,359
threats perspective of all of that

1574
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,640
most of the access comes in through

1575
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,140
Information Technology because that's

1576
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,720
his job there is never an air gap so I

1577
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,760
move over into a beachhead and a

1578
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,680
beachhead is a higher level system like

1579
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,780
an HMI was an example I gave another one

1580
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,099
might be a distributed control system

1581
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,799
and here's the thing so

1582
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,539
when we talk about pure operational

1583
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:57,119
Technologies they're all these wacky

1584
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:58,920
really custom protocols and

1585
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,680
architectures and codes like you you

1586
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,660
take years of training to learn how to

1587
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,920
code at that level

1588
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,720
but here's the thing

1589
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,660
that HMI and the DCS speaks all of that

1590
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,039
it's already built for it that's its

1591
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,420
entire purpose is to talk to them and

1592
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,680
tell them what to do

1593
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,299
and what operating system do you think

1594
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:17,460
those things run on

1595
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,980
the X works

1596
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,619
pick your version of Windows only two

1597
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,339
generations old

1598
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,700
all right so that's what I looked like

1599
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,538
with my coveted beard

1600
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,940
you haven't seen cyber Gandalf

1601
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,880
I think that was an RSA uh interview so

1602
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,119
what we've seen in the last 10 years

1603
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,920
and this is public right I'm not sharing

1604
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,660
anything classified you can look this up

1605
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,220
and they've been publishing more of this

1606
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,140
since 2012 we have seen iterative

1607
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,180
intelligence campaigns we've attributed

1608
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,700
them to China to Russia to Iran

1609
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,619
North Korea shows up a little bit but

1610
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:01,619
their primary modus operandi is

1611
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:03,660
ransomware so that dear leader can pay

1612
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,280
for expensive whiskey

1613
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,079
the other three have much more

1614
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,119
interesting per you know purposes

1615
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,020
against us so why that's important is we

1616
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,700
talk about the Cyber Redline has anyone

1617
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,079
heard that before

1618
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,839
right what's the point where an attack

1619
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,059
is something we're going to respond in a

1620
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:22,920
certain way

1621
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,920
because if you notice 10 years of

1622
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,619
hundreds of campaigns

1623
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:32,099
with this having an increasing Up Tempo

1624
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:35,520
and yet there's been no real loss of

1625
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,500
life as there

1626
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,500
why do you think that is

1627
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,819
what's that

1628
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:44,400
because that's a red light do you think

1629
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,740
the United States government's response

1630
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,660
is going to be we're going to cyber you

1631
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,339
back

1632
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,440
no the number one military in the world

1633
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,299
is not going to cyber you back if you

1634
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:55,920
cross the red line

1635
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,500
our adversaries know this and so what

1636
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,980
the intent has been is I want to map I

1637
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,839
want to do reconnaissance I want to

1638
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,180
break in I want to understand I want to

1639
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,339
iterate and go through

1640
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:10,260
um a theory if I'm gonna can jump into

1641
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,500
the water example is that Florida water

1642
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,059
hack

1643
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:16,920
that change of that lie would have

1644
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,960
changed it to a dangerous level

1645
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,220
so

1646
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,839
does my hypothesis hold water

1647
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:26,640
at that point and here's why I think it

1648
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,980
does because there's a second manual

1649
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,380
safety in that process

1650
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,420
they don't immediately release that

1651
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:34,740
treated water directly into the water

1652
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,720
supply they manually test it in tanks

1653
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,680
that they hold

1654
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,500
this threat that actor who whomever it

1655
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,599
was knew that and what they were doing

1656
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,280
was measuring response

1657
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:52,380
so last one Colonial pipeline Colonial

1658
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,079
pipeline Silver Lining is that that's

1659
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:56,520
that's the part that's the good that I

1660
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,839
have on there the one good part is

1661
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,660
ransomware became a kitchen work yeah

1662
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,819
speeding up got it

1663
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:06,240
so what's the bad the bad is a private

1664
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,520
company unilaterally made a decision

1665
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,260
that shut down

1666
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,980
oil and gas to the entire southeast of

1667
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,359
the United States

1668
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,279
they did that without this affecting

1669
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,140
operational technology directly it was

1670
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,719
I.T only that was affected and I believe

1671
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:23,520
this is my call and I'm being recorded

1672
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,219
so too bad Colonial you

1673
01:08:26,219 --> 01:08:28,279
um

1674
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,380
no they panicked

1675
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,259
they responded out of fear they didn't

1676
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:36,479
know I mean they they shut it down with

1677
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,580
an hour of it being called like they saw

1678
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,540
it and then they immediately shut

1679
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,060
everything down I second that what's

1680
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,479
that by second yeah and what is it that

1681
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:47,399
causes this fear the fear is when we

1682
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,198
don't know and we haven't trained it

1683
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:50,640
before

1684
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,620
they didn't train

1685
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,319
they did not practice the response

1686
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:57,359
tabletop tabletop tabletop if they had

1687
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,219
done just a couple of tabletops I

1688
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,899
promise you I promise I mean

1689
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,819
maybe some degree of confidence that

1690
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:06,899
that probably would have been handled

1691
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:09,318
differently

1692
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,399
thank you

1693
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,779
all right lawyer Liz we need you to lay

1694
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:23,939
some True Stone on Municipal service

1695
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:26,520
sector problems are there any

1696
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,120
now not even a little bit and so typical

1697
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,219
lawyer disclaimer

1698
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:35,520
um while I am a lawyer unless you work

1699
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,219
for Scythe so Bryson excluded and I

1700
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:39,540
think we have one other colleague in

1701
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,020
here I am not your lawyer and even

1702
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,000
beyond that I am not your personal

1703
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,520
lawyer so if y'all get arrested in Las

1704
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,279
Vegas I am not licensed to practice here

1705
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,380
I will not bail you out of jail but I

1706
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,500
will laugh hysterically and make sure

1707
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,840
your mug shots get posted everywhere of

1708
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,940
course make sure I have full concerns et

1709
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,580
cetera et cetera et cetera but in a

1710
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,560
prior life before jumping over into the

1711
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,100
startup world I was in private practice

1712
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,340
even before I joined the city of Atlanta

1713
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,560
so as anyone's familiar with state of

1714
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,960
Georgia because we don't do anything

1715
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,179
wrong or newsworthy et cetera et cetera

1716
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:21,540
et cetera but there are 159 counties in

1717
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,699
the great state of Georgia

1718
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:28,380
so if you're thinking of the sticky

1719
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,920
spider web that gets built when you have

1720
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,300
a 159 counties in a state that if you

1721
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,880
know Atlanta maybe you know Augusta

1722
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,040
maybe you know Savannah

1723
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,620
those are our big economic areas in

1724
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,500
addition to Gainesville Georgia in

1725
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,900
Dalton Georgia which are two capitals of

1726
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,000
Commerce for chicken

1727
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,060
poultry manufacturing and carpets

1728
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,120
so now you're thinking wow the great

1729
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,679
state of Georgia and all these counties

1730
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:01,280
are just FL their coffers are

1731
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,880
overflowing with cash no so I got to

1732
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,100
serve as part of a team that were the

1733
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,040
county and School Board attorneys for

1734
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,739
about 30 of those different state or for

1735
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,360
30 of those different counties and

1736
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,360
school boards so if you want to talk

1737
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,179
about getting in the weeds and talking

1738
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:24,300
about old school systems when you have

1739
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,460
some of the most economically depressed

1740
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:29,520
areas in school districts where schools

1741
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,400
are serving as you know everything in

1742
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,020
addition to counties counties are

1743
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,659
providing lots of different answers for

1744
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,880
all kinds of things so when you're

1745
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,920
talking about a ransomware attack on a

1746
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,960
County government that if they can't get

1747
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,880
their systems up the Social Security

1748
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,239
checks other Community Support Services

1749
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,239
are immediately shut down so next slide

1750
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,620
so we're going to talk a little bit

1751
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,540
about and I kind of jammed a lot of

1752
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,580
things in here because some of us being

1753
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,460
lawyers and Rural followers held to the

1754
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,360
two slide requests

1755
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,860
[Laughter]

1756
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,120
thank you thank you very much

1757
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,880
some of us also read the emails and

1758
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,320
other Communications about the panel

1759
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,239
thank you

1760
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,500
so now that we're going to talk about

1761
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,800
Municipal governments as well because I

1762
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,719
wisely decided you know what I was

1763
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,340
having fun with technology so I'm going

1764
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:28,440
to get out of Private Practice and I'm

1765
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,140
going to go into public practice so I

1766
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,820
joined the great city of Atlanta as a

1767
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,159
senior assistant City Attorney in charge

1768
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,100
of the world's busiest airport

1769
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:42,840
technology project so I in 2017.

1770
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,140
had joined the city of Atlanta in 2018.

1771
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,440
well before it became a national topic

1772
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,140
for everybody else around dinner tables

1773
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:56,300
in Atlanta we suddenly got to learn oh

1774
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,699
ransomware samsam and being one of the

1775
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,640
only attorneys uh in the Department of

1776
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,800
Law who had any background whatsoever in

1777
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,300
cyber security information security

1778
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,719
researchers hackers you can imagine kind

1779
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,500
of the oh moment when I'm on the

1780
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,480
department of aviation's network

1781
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,900
computers and my colleagues on the

1782
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,060
actual city of Atlanta Network computers

1783
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,340
suddenly we're going hey I can't access

1784
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:26,400
my files I got this thing up

1785
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,900
well by the grace of God we had also had

1786
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,300
implemented Network segmentation so our

1787
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,699
Watershed Department was on its own

1788
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:37,500
network there was not crossover that we

1789
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,540
could tell we joke about tabletop

1790
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,640
exercises let me explain to you what

1791
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,380
happens when you realize there is still

1792
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,320
one uh computer that is probably still

1793
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,780
connected from the middle of the

1794
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,719
Airfield FAA requires that you have fire

1795
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,100
stations so that you can have fire

1796
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,320
trucks that can get to every any

1797
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,080
aircraft emergency with x number of

1798
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,040
seconds

1799
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,980
so we had one fire station that still

1800
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,080
perhaps maybe was connected to the

1801
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,780
city's Network that we are realizing in

1802
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,360
these so if you want to see someone run

1803
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,300
quickly

1804
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,219
tell them that you may have one computer

1805
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,260
that may be about to boot up that is

1806
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,699
still connected to the city's Network

1807
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:20,100
that also is a crossover point to the

1808
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,219
world's busiest airport uh Network and

1809
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:25,140
if someone can get over to that and

1810
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,780
kindly unplug it from the wall and

1811
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,360
essentially smash it and do it right now

1812
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,420
that is what we're doing so what I

1813
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,580
wanted to highlight real quick in

1814
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,920
talking about municipal government so I

1815
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,600
could have painted this picture you've

1816
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,360
got these governments that are not full

1817
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,480
of experts everything literally is on

1818
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,760
fire when it comes to for example city

1819
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,560
of Atlanta and we had a bridge that

1820
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,100
actually caught on fire and collapsed so

1821
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,780
when you have all of this and you're

1822
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,880
thinking okay well what happened

1823
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,239
recently and Somerset County New Jersey

1824
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,900
well they got hit recently and their

1825
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,000
county databases and everything got

1826
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,239
taken back to they got to party like it

1827
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:11,940
was 1977.

1828
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,760
so if you can imagine all the services

1829
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,620
um I'm not saying anyone Josh Corman

1830
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,860
recently uh became married

1831
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,679
um and you go file some paperwork well

1832
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:24,540
what happens if you can't access that

1833
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,480
paperwork because Somerset County New

1834
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,699
Jersey is partying like it's 1977 and

1835
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:32,580
they're going back to hand records

1836
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:36,719
so okay but not only that when you go a

1837
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,360
little bit deeper what happens when all

1838
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,920
right so our systems are down we're

1839
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,840
being we're on a reservoir attack we've

1840
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,440
table topped the out of this and oh

1841
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,780
wait how do we communicate with each

1842
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:50,760
other or how do our citizens communicate

1843
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,320
with us oh I know what we're going to do

1844
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,440
we're going to set up Gmail accounts for

1845
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,300
the County Commissioners for the health

1846
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,400
department Emergency Operations County

1847
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,880
Clerk and Sheriff's departments we're

1848
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,760
operating off of Gmail accounts

1849
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,900
so

1850
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,699
fun when you think about it so it's

1851
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:13,140
taking it from this like high level oh

1852
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:15,540
no we're talking about it

1853
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,159
OT systems we're talking about risk

1854
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:20,400
mitigation now we're talking about Gmail

1855
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,640
because that's what the Playbook has so

1856
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,980
all right what's happening in the middle

1857
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,560
of the war room is all of this is going

1858
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,659
down well one of the great ways to

1859
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:33,060
highlight this is the great state of

1860
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,719
North Carolina in March the governor

1861
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,640
um had an executive order says all right

1862
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,739
we've got the Statewide task force

1863
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,440
because as you're in the middle of the

1864
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,600
storm and you're thinking okay who do we

1865
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,239
call by the way half your playbooks are

1866
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,760
on the network you just shut down there

1867
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,040
are some weird people like me who are

1868
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,620
probably in your department of laws I

1869
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,300
think where I print everything

1870
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,120
so I'm racing to my office which was fun

1871
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,640
and heels uh to say oh wait I think I

1872
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:04,739
have hard copies of the following things

1873
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:07,380
so as you're pulling all this well the

1874
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,000
governor North Carolina says sorry we're

1875
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,080
gonna have this executive order

1876
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,880
everyone's going to work together we've

1877
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,699
got this task force yeah the task force

1878
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:18,239
had been in place since 2017. do you

1879
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,640
know what no one knew it even was there

1880
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,400
for most of the time so great we've got

1881
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,080
all these resources who are you calling

1882
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,820
you don't know who to call because it's

1883
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,300
not obvious next slides please as we'll

1884
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,500
skip over that because we're going to

1885
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,060
jump right into the education sector

1886
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:36,179
because while education attacks are

1887
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:40,679
actually on the decrease decline what is

1888
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:42,540
happening is the cost so we're going to

1889
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:45,179
flash back real quick to save Atlanta

1890
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:46,679
because we talked about insurance

1891
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:48,179
earlier

1892
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,840
um yeah great Atlanta had just gone

1893
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,060
under our policy had just gone into

1894
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:56,760
effect we had checked all the boxes I

1895
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,560
believe we had made need one payment

1896
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,500
towards our policy and 20 million

1897
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,420
dollars coverage but when you talk about

1898
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,679
schools and we're going to think of

1899
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,679
Alice Cooper school's out for summer

1900
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:10,020
well in New Jersey one of the largest

1901
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,780
school districts in New Jersey had a

1902
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,940
ransomware attack recently which meant

1903
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,100
for all of the high school students they

1904
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,380
had to cancel their exams

1905
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,840
so if you were waiting on that exam to

1906
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,400
lift up your grade that was going to

1907
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,760
help you graduate so sad too bad because

1908
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,080
when you talk about these school

1909
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,120
districts and everything being on fire

1910
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,460
think of what's Happening we're there

1911
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,140
still not back these students did not

1912
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,620
know what to do with overhead projectors

1913
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,840
because the school district had to

1914
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,940
utilize overhead projectors they said

1915
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,640
well this is a great exercise in stem

1916
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,739
because what happens when you don't have

1917
01:18:46,739 --> 01:18:49,620
access to it and you have to they were

1918
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,900
able to find them so not only that but

1919
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,760
they had no access to the online

1920
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,920
resources where you have now put all

1921
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,080
these great books in all of the

1922
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,719
educational teaching materials online in

1923
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,580
the cloud you're accessing them from

1924
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,080
your tablet no

1925
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,000
these students no longer had access to

1926
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,520
that because the county had to then pull

1927
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,800
it off but when you look at okay well

1928
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,380
who do you call when it's the school

1929
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:15,300
board the school district that's gone

1930
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,340
down well first of all you call the

1931
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,960
school board you call the superintendent

1932
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,120
you call the school board you call the

1933
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,060
school boards attorneys you also call

1934
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,880
the State uh Bureau of Investigations

1935
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,360
you call sza you call the FBI the doj

1936
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,760
you also call and as I highlight on

1937
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,500
several of these slides about six

1938
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,140
different other agencies and if you want

1939
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,080
to have fun you sit with your popcorn in

1940
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,659
the back and watch all of them fight not

1941
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:45,120
over who is taking the lead not only

1942
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,520
that if anyone here has worked for a

1943
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,020
company that represented the city of

1944
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,300
Atlanta and our ransomware attack I

1945
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,980
applaud you a lot of y'all led me to

1946
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,880
drink

1947
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,000
because we had about five different IR

1948
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,280
teams sitting in the emergency response

1949
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,679
room all deciding that they were going

1950
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,540
to leave because they had a contract I

1951
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,620
said great

1952
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,260
sweat you all have the same contract

1953
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,360
because that my predecessors didn't know

1954
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,400
but we didn't plan for this we didn't

1955
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,300
know what was going to happen we didn't

1956
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,280
know who was going to be to leave so

1957
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,100
everything is on fire it's even more so

1958
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,080
on fire when you have all these County

1959
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,699
governments municipalities School Board

1960
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:22,080
attorneys and no one who knows what

1961
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,239
they're doing nor do they have the

1962
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,980
resource to pay for it because they

1963
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,199
probably oh by the way accounting and

1964
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:31,080
city state municipalities I think a lot

1965
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,060
of them are self-insured

1966
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,920
because they get to opt out of insurance

1967
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,040
requirements so we have no pot of money

1968
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,719
uh we have no idea how to solve the

1969
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:41,760
solutions and so I now work in the

1970
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,810
private sector once again for a startup

1971
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:46,139
[Music]

1972
01:20:46,139 --> 01:20:49,639
so here we go thank you

1973
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,820
thank you uh we have time for uh one

1974
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,380
question

1975
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,320
so if you've got one question

1976
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,100
if you can either walk over here or wave

1977
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,900
to Katie

1978
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,060
and she will bring you a mic

1979
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,780
quickly

1980
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,460
earlier this year I started to hear

1981
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,440
about an incident response framework

1982
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,980
called ics for ICS

1983
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,420
um do you have a take on that whether

1984
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,900
it's good or bad or well

1985
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,840
is beneficial or well yeah so yeah ics

1986
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,360
for ICS was championed by the Vice

1987
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,000
President of product security uh where

1988
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,980
she at now Schneider Electric she's at

1989
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:37,380
Schneider Megan Samford

1990
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,900
um and what her idea was so she had a

1991
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,060
background working Emergency Management

1992
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,580
at this in the state of Virginia and the

1993
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,139
idea that she came up with is that if

1994
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:48,179
you look at how disast recovery and

1995
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:49,679
Emergency Management is done with like

1996
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,320
FEMA that it's standardized across

1997
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,739
vocabulary and process everywhere so

1998
01:21:55,739 --> 01:21:57,179
when we're doing industrial control

1999
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:58,920
system response what if we could

2000
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,800
standardize that same way and so that

2001
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,620
culminated in um with a lot of joint

2002
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,120
agency work

2003
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,100
um that debuted actually at S4 in Miami

2004
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,300
in June

2005
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,400
um so in short it's a fantastic thing

2006
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,639
it's a great idea and there's a lot of

2007
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,380
steam coming behind it including

2008
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:19,860
training and certification

2009
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:23,280
Mr Corman do you have a question I'm

2010
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,719
just hoping that anybody that has ideas

2011
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,159
for how to collaborate with our water

2012
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:27,300
friend

2013
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,980
um or anybody up there

2014
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,560
empathy starts with a drink it starts

2015
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,860
with a drink

2016
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,239
um no beer without water

2017
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,040
it's gonna start with empathy because

2018
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,080
the opposite of a profound truth is not

2019
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,639
a lie but another profound truth so

2020
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:43,380
these are both dangerous outdated

2021
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,639
systems they don't have time and money

2022
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,699
for and we can't allow them to be that

2023
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:50,580
vulnerable so if there's any coaching or

2024
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:51,840
advice you can give us besides giving

2025
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,300
you a drink uh as to how to best be

2026
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,000
truly helpful versus you know

2027
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,219
taxi drivers

2028
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:01,199
um

2029
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,600
I think true to the mission

2030
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,219
um you know we all live in a community

2031
01:23:05,219 --> 01:23:08,159
that is being serviced by somebody

2032
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,020
um start participating in the board

2033
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,000
meetings and asking questions and

2034
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,580
helping them understand what their risks

2035
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,360
are

2036
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,120
uh

2037
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,260
that's that's probably one of the best

2038
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,540
ways I could could offer up to to get

2039
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,639
involved

2040
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,040
and most of those who are

2041
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,380
televised now anyway so

2042
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,420
you know it's like any other industry

2043
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,400
though it's you know the the email

2044
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,920
server has a thousand percent more

2045
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,139
availability and uptime than the than

2046
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:39,600
the systems running the plant

2047
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,380
um so they they get computer racks and

2048
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,820
server rooms instead of the janitors

2049
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,460
closet so

2050
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,540
okay

2051
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,400
um please join me in thanking our

2052
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,599
fabulous panelists
