13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
wednesday the second morning early

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
because it means you're really serious

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
so we always make sure that we have a

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
really serious talk on the second day

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
if any of you follow me on twitter you

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,719
know that my friend mike murray usually

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,320
has this spot

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,800
but mike decided that life was too hard

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,079
in april

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,600
and left us

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
so we have a memorial in the back but

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
that is actually for everyone we've lost

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
and so if you have someone you've lost

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
over the last two years

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,399
you're welcome to write a note about

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
what you miss about them

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
sorry i keep promising myself i won't

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
cry and i do

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,520
thank you

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
so it was really hard to

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
find someone who could talk about

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
management because that is what we

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
always talk about on the second day

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,920
first day we really talk about sort of

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,680
career search and challenges and how to

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
make things better and how do we stand

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
up to the challenges that we're facing

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,439
community who have learned

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,200
through their mistakes and through their

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
opportunities and their challenges and

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960

talking about as you can see on the

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,640
agenda here um there's a lot of material

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
that i'm going to kind of cram into a

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,519
45-minute session that's why we're

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
calling it kind of a one-on-one session

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,720
um

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
but uh you know i want to take you kind

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
of through my management journey and

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,599
some of the things that i've learned

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,920
over the years some of the failures i've

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
made um and also just some of the

96
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
concepts that i've come to learn

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
which hopefully you can take things take

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
something out of this talk and then you

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
can apply it in your daily job

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
so if you do me a favor think of like

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,000
three things that you can take away as

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
as i go through the presentation

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
and think about how you can apply that

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
when you get back to your job um when

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
you get when you leave vegas

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,879
so a little bit about me so

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,120
my career journey started you know about

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
17 years ago

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,799
after getting out of the military i

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
served in the united states marine corps

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
i was probably in the best time that you

112
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,439
could be in the military so from 1993 to

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,080
1997 it was between the desert desert

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
storms the desert wars

115
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,519
so not a whole lot going on even though

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
i was in infantry as well my recruiter

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
lied to me so that's how i ended up in

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
infantry

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
had to meet the quota i guess

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
but um

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,919
after i got in the military went to

122
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,120
school

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
started getting involved in i.t type

124
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
work so i started out on a help desk

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
did vulnerability management i was the

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
server guy i was running

127
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
networks and servers and all of that

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
and i was presented with an opportunity

129
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,280
to uh join the very first infosec team i

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
know i say infosec i'm saying that

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
because i'm old right information

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,919
security was before cyber security

133
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
and so i got the opportunity to start

134
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,720
this department i was the first hire and

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,800
i helped build an information security

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
policy i got to do all kinds of things

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
identity management i was exposed to

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,639
things i had never been exposed to

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,759
before and i got to coordinate our first

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
pen test of the company and this was a

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
kind of medium-sized property management

142
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
real estate company

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,039
and let me tell you it was glorious

144
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,840
right

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
the company i hired owned everything

146
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,160
like in 10 minutes

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,080
and i loved it i loved every minute of

148
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
it and of course my my manager at the

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
data we're so vulnerable and i'm just

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,199
loving every minute of them like this is

153

what i want to do i want to be a pen

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
tester i want to be a hacker because

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
this gentleman i learned everything i

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360

staying technical

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,319
um so after that i ended up on uh

164
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160

165

and um i started doing things like

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
physical security assessments and

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
physical pen tests social engineering it

171
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
was kind of in the golden age and i

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
think chris nickerson if you know who he

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
is he kind of coined the term tiger team

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
he had that tv show where he was like

175
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
stealing cars and all that fun stuff and

176
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
and that's really was kind of the at the

177
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
the start of red teaming so i was kind

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
of in the infancy of that which is

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
pretty cool

180
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,199
and then one day i started uh i left the

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
bank and i um was consulting and i i

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
left the bank because those of you that

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
worked in finance or a bank they're

184
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
they're like dinosaurs right very slow

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,759
moving

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,680
takes a long time to fix and make

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
changes to things so i went into

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
consulting which was the complete

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
opposite right you're seeing different

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
networks different clients the good the

191
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,319
bad the ugly it was very exciting

192
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
until one day um my manager at the time

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
said hey i'm taking a new position

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
within the firm

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
i'm going to head up like research and

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
development and so that opens up a

197
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,479
position in management and i said first

198
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,700
thing i said was does it pay more money

199
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,400
[Laughter]

200
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,120
and he said to me no but we can change

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,479
your title

202
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
and i'm like okay great i'll i'll take

203
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
it

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
and in that kind of

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
discussion with him i thought about like

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
well do i really want to go into

207
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,479
management when i'm a technical person

208
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,160
i'm a pen tester i really like the

209
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
technical aspect and he said well don't

210
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,800
worry you could do both

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
and i said all right great i'll do both

212
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
and i did both for for a while for

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
almost four years i was a principal

214
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,680
consultant still doing pen testing still

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
doing consulting but also managing a

216
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
team of pen testers

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
eventually though i got to the point

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,199
where i felt burnout i was getting

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,520
burned out and i needed to make a change

220
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,479
and so i left the consulting gig that i

221
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,120
had i went to varicode and became a

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
manager where they told me we don't want

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
you doing any pen testing we just want

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
you doing um you know management and so

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
that was uh unfortunately the last time

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,599
i did a pen test was those many years

227
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,039
ago um and we'll talk about you know

228
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
people ask me like do you miss it do you

229
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
miss the technical aspects and i'll say

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,440
sometimes i do but management to me is

231
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,039
actually a little bit more rewarding in

232
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,120
a lot of ways and we'll talk about that

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
too in this talk but

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
um

235
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,240
but throughout that those experiences

236
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
have led me to bishop fox where i was a

237
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
practice director and now an avp

238
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
of consulting where i now deal with

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
different things at the executive level

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
so maybe one day i'll be doing a talk on

241
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
executive and director level type stuff

242
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,479
but um but yeah it's been a journey a

243
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
great journey and i'm glad to share some

244
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,880
of this with you today um and also i'm

245
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
the founder and co-host of the shared

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
security show so i've been doing that

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
for 13 years not sure how i found time

248
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
to do all that but we're one of the

249
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,000
longest running

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
security podcasts so check it out if

251
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,920
you're looking for something to listen

252
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
to

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,240
so this presentation is i really put

254
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
this together to to make us better

255
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
leaders and managers

256
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,279
and i've kind of laid out three things

257
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,120
you'll hear three themes

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
in this talk and they're all about

259
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
conversations and about communication so

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,880
one

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,839
how can we improve as managers amongst

262
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
ourselves and as our peers right it's

263
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
important to talk to each other about

264
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
how ways we can be a better manager and

265
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,519
this is one of the reasons is this talk

266
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
we're here we're talking about it we're

267
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
listening um and hopefully we're gonna

268
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
be better because of it

269
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
the next one is having conversations

270
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
with our teams

271
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,839
so seeking feedback of how am i as your

272
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
manager what type of feedback do you

273
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
have for me how can i do my job better

274
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
how can i help you that's one thing that

275
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
we'll be talking about and then having

276
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,440
more conversations with our teams about

277
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
communication or i'm sorry about career

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
conversations

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,720
because that's something that i find

280
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
that we forget about we get so busy in

281
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
our day-to-day you know fight fighting

282
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
fires and what's the next thing we need

283
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
to talk about on our 101s and it's

284
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
typically you know whatever the current

285
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,279
fire is um but what i'm saying is we

286
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
need to take take a step back and really

287
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
start having more career conversations

288
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
because our employees are asking for

289
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,800
those they need our help they need our

290
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,120
guidance and our coaching on how to take

291
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
their careers to the next level

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
so this is importance and there was a

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,240
really good talk yesterday wes shepard

294
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,200
gave a talk on off failing upwards which

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,040
i highly recommend you check out uh

296
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,519
it'll be on the youtube um and great

297
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
talk but um

298
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
you're gonna fail

299
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
your teams are gonna fail and that's

300
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,920
okay i think we have to embrace failure

301
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,560
at some point because that's how we

302
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
learn that's how we get better

303
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
and i've made lots of mistakes and lots

304
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
of failures in my career and honestly

305
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,800
early on i would get pretty upset with

306
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
myself that

307
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
you know especially with one thing i

308
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,079
think a lot of hiring managers will

309
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,560
understand if you make a bad hire

310
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
if you hire somebody and you end up

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
having to let them go say after a couple

312
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
weeks in my case it was literally a

313
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
couple days

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,880
that i had to let somebody go that i

315
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,240
hired that hurts that really stings and

316
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
you kind of take it personally

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
but over time i've kind of learned to

318
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
just like not take those things so

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
personally i'm human i make mistakes we

320
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,040
all do but i look back and i think what

321
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,519
did i learn from that experience and how

322
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,920
can i do my interviewing how can i do my

323
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
hiring processes how can i do a better

324
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
job

325
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,839
and

326
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
i will say that i think over the years

327
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,839
i've done a better job of hiring people

328
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,680
because of those failures and because of

329
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
those those bad experiences

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
so um but failure is really the way that

331
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,959
we learn and improve

332
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,120
so who's uh grace murray hopper fans

333
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,160
here

334
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
yes yes she's she's an incredible leader

335
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
i love this quote from her uh you manage

336
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
things you lead people

337
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,560
um a little little thing about uh grace

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,120
murray hopper um way back in 1947

339
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,200
she actually kind of her and her team

340
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,160
coined the phrase debugging um and they

341
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
actually found a moth that was stuck in

342
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,920
a relay which was stopping the operation

343
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
of the computer and computers back then

344
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
1947. you can imagine it's like this

345
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,560
entire room

346
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
right um and then they took the moth out

347
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,519
and they actually wrote a note that said

348
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,160
first actual case of a bug being found i

349
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
thought that was like really cool so

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
back in the 40s but

351
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
what i like about her is that she's

352
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,839
absolutely a technical powerhouse right

353
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,320
back she she's she's done so many things

354
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
for the industry

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,839
but she's also an amazing leader she's

356
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,240
an admiral in the us navy right she's

357
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
managing people large teams of people um

358
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
and so that's a little thing i like to

359
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,360
call out about her that inspires me as

360
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
someone that's been technical and now

361
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,839
moving into management and managing

362
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
large teams so hopefully she's someone

363
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
that can also inspire you as well

364
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
so let's talk about the problem with

365
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
management

366
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
first thing i'll say is it's it's

367
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
definitely the hardest and most

368
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
challenging job that i've ever had

369
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,279
because of all the things they have to

370
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
deal with especially with people but

371
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
it's also the most rewarding job that

372
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,279
i've had

373
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,920
i thought getting you know 50 shells on

374
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
my screen from you know popping boxes

375
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
and accessing sensitive data that's a

376
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,839
huge rush but it's more of a rush in my

377
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
opinion of seeing my team do amazing

378
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
things seeing them grow their careers

379
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
seeing them challenge and doing stuff

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,399
that they told me

381
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,240
there's no way i can do this there's no

382
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,079
way i'm capable of doing these things

383
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
and they do it and you watch them do it

384
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
or you help coach them through that and

385
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
that is an experience that i don't think

386
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,680
i could ever replace

387
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
it's absolutely amazing

388
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
the other thing about technical teams is

389
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,760
that it can be a little bit different

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,560
because i think as pen testers and

391
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
hackers there's definitely the

392
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,199
introverse verts for the

393
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,360
versus the extroverts breakers versus

394
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,600
fixers right we've got communicators and

395
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
non-communicators

396
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,040
you know pen testers and security

397
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
consultants are an interesting bunch so

398
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
sometimes you have to adapt your

399
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,160
leadership style to those different

400
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
personality types and we'll talk about

401
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,800
personality types in a little bit

402
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,399
but coming from a technical background

403
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
jumping into management it can be very

404
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,800
challenging and very difficult um and so

405
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,920
we'll share i'll share some of the

406
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
stories around that here coming up

407
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
so do we all know the difference between

408
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,959
a boss and a leader

409
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,800
so a boss is i'd say more on the

410
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
negative side of things right

411
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
and i kind of put together just some

412
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,639
some differentiators just so you can see

413
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,880
but a boss really

414
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
is about driving employees rights and a

415
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
leader is more about coaching and we'll

416
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,199
talk more about coaching a little bit

417
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
but i did want to call out one thing in

418
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,760
this um who's ever had a manager take uh

419
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
credit for work that you did

420
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
isn't that the worst

421
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,839
absolute backstabbing thing anybody

422
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,680
could do to you i've had happen to me

423
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
too and it's absolutely awful um so i

424
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
take i kind of look at these these uh

425
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,320
these differences

426
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,560
you know a boss uses people they take

427
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
credits but a leader

428
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
develops people and gives credit and i

429
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,560
think that's the one thing to take away

430
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,079
from like this slide and just think

431
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,240
about the bosses and the managers you on

432
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,320
that bosses maybe bosses you've had in

433
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
the past we all remember the good ones

434
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
but we also remember the bad ones that

435
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,560
that maybe we even left an organization

436
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
because we had a really bad manager

437
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
so what is your role as a leader um and

438
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
speaking of kind of bad bosses i know

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,839
there's a funny movie about that too but

440
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,440
um how many of you had a micromanager

441
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,680
oh another one that's really bad right

442
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,920
just horrible i've had those two i had i

443
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
had one manager that hovered over me

444
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
back when we were working in offices and

445
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
you know make sure are you done yet are

446
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
you done yet are you done yet and like

447
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
stuff that drives you crazy

448
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,160
um

449
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,759
but we don't want to be micromanagers

450
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,720
right

451
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,480
as a leader you're really there to guide

452
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,279
and facilitate your employees you're not

453
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
there to hover over them

454
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
and you know thinking about how often

455
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,839
we're talking to our direct reports so

456
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,199
we'll talk about one-on-ones and the

457
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
importance of that in a minute but we

458
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,399
really need to be

459
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
keep having those conversations

460
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
about their jobs about their role

461
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
and really encouraging them

462
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
to do the best they can in their job and

463
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,759
a lot of that comes down to setting the

464
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,320
right expectations so

465
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,399
i find that employees

466
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,720
don't like to ask what's expected of me

467
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
they want to hear from you typically so

468
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
we'll talk about expectations in a

469
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
little bit but i found some ways of how

470
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
you can communicate those expectations a

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
little bit better where you're not

472
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,799
sounding maybe so forceful or you know

473
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
like a dictator right but um there's

474
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
things that we can do to to help that

475
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,359
and then we're talking about career

476
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,480
conversations um it's true employees are

477
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,880
responsible for their career they're

478
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,199
responsible for managing that

479
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,160
but you as a leader you're there to meet

480
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,839
those goals help them meet their goals

481
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,799
and coach them through that so um i i

482
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
find this funny too it's like i've got

483
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,919
employees like that just won't say

484
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,000
anything of like you ask them hey so

485
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,520
what do you want to do for training or

486
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
where do you want to take your career

487
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,960
and they just say that they say well i'm

488
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
not really sure

489
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,720
so that's your job then is to encourage

490
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
them like have you thought about this

491
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
have you thought about that have you

492
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
thought about this and then they come

493
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,799
back and say okay yeah i haven't thought

494
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
about that that's what i mean by

495
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
coaching you know giving them those

496
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,280
ideas not telling them but giving them

497
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,080
the encouragement

498
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,280
so setting expectations so

499
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,559
this is probably one of the most

500
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,679
important aspects um of managing in my

501
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,640
opinion

502
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
um

503
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
and i asked too like all of you if you

504
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
ever had managers that just never set

505
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
any expectations with you right you're

506
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
just kind of left to figure that out on

507
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
your own and honestly it just never goes

508
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,640
well because you don't know if you're

509
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
doing the right thing or not because no

510
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
one has told you otherwise

511
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,679
so um and this can also vary right so

512
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
depending on

513
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,720
your job title or level so i put in here

514
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
you know different expectations for a

515
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
senior member of the team versus junior

516
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
team

517
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
expectations will be a lot different so

518
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,799
we have to communicate those

519
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
expectations at all times

520
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,039
because we don't want our employees

521
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
trying to figure that out on their own

522
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,080
it just never ends well

523
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
so let's talk about respect

524
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
so respect is interesting because it's

525
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,360
one of those things that i you know when

526
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,919
i like when i came to varacode uh and

527
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,000
some people in the audience uh that were

528
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
on that team probably know um you're

529
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,840
coming into a brand new team you don't

530
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
know anybody and of course they're like

531
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
who the heck is this guy like he's our

532
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
new manager you know because you

533
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
inherited all these people you don't

534
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
know them they don't know you

535
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
so you have to earn respect as a leader

536
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
um and that goes both ways um and so a

537
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,039
lot of times we think as leaders like

538
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,559
i'm gonna do all these things to get

539
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
their respect but employees need to do

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,120
the same thing to you as well so

541
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
i always say that respect goes both ways

542
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,480
and a lot of that comes down to

543
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
listening we'll talk about the art of

544
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
listening here shortly

545
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
and that's the first thing i did when i

546
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
came to that team was

547
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
i wanted to hear about all the problems

548
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
i wanted to hear about what's going on i

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
didn't change anything i was there to

550
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,039
listen and take that feedback

551
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,720
and then you start talking about with

552
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
the team about what you're going to do

553
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,160
to make things better and all that so

554
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,919
don't come in there like a bull in the

555
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,840
china shop right just making all these

556
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
changes

557
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,960
they will not respect you if you do that

558
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,799
so the art of listening this is

559
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,960
something that has taken me quite a

560
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
while and i still have to work at this

561
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
because it's it's tough

562
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
um but

563
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,080
i think it's really important and

564
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,799
especially in a world of remotes where

565
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
we're using teams and zoom for

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,799
everything still

567
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,039
where like things like eye contact and

568
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
body language you may not think are

569
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
important but they still are even in a

570
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,919
virtual world so um one of the things i

571
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,360
do is um with video chat so

572
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
ever going to a meeting and nobody's got

573
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
their video on but as soon as one person

574
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
turns that video on

575
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,679
a lot of people start doing the same

576
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
thing it's like the lemming effect right

577
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
that's one technique i use i don't force

578
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
people to put their cameras on but i

579
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
really feel that it's valuable to at

580
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
least have some kind of eye to eye

581
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
contact with that other person when

582
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
you're having those conversations um put

583
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
the camera literally like you know so

584
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,919
you're looking into the camera

585
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,600
move your hands i mean those types of

586
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,080
things i think are very important

587
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,400
in active listening so

588
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,679
what we what do we mean by active

589
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
listening so we're talking about

590
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
clarifying what the other person just

591
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,840
said so it tells the other person oh you

592
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,000
are listening to me you understood what

593
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,559
i just told you and the way you do that

594
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,280
is by asking questions so

595
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,120
your your direct report will say

596
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,480
something like oh yeah i did this blah

597
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
blah so what i heard you say was or you

598
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
can say are you saying that or did you

599
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
mean that and that clarifies that you

600
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
are indeed listening to them and you

601
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
understand what they're saying and that

602
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
goes a long way just by changing the

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
conversation a bit

604
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
but the general ground rule i found with

605
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
with any conversation

606
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
and this applies to not just the

607
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
business world but your personal life in

608
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
relationships and other things as well

609
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
uh ninety percent of that conversation

610
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,760
should be you listening um so you should

611
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
be talking less and listening more and

612
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
that's really hard um for a lot just a

613
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,799
lot of reasons right so think about all

614
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,320
your personal relationships and other

615
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
things sometimes we just want to start

616
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
talking and

617
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
and we just inadvertently

618
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
not that we're being malicious but

619
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,679
sometimes it comes across like we don't

620
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
care about what the other person's

621
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
saying when we really do

622
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,559
but if you stop pause and just let them

623
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,120
talk sometimes that's all you need to do

624
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,960
to improve the relationship and and the

625
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
conversation

626
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,360
so this is a big one

627
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
that i instill on on all of my managers

628
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,400
throughout my career that it took me a

629
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
while to learn this but the the really

630
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
the importance of the one-on-one meeting

631
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,919
because this is really your only

632
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,720
opportunity to connect with your team

633
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
and you have to make these meetings a

634
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
priority

635
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
i've moved meetings cancelled meetings

636
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
this to me is one of the most important

637
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
things that a manager can do to connect

638
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
with their teams

639
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
and this is where you need to talk about

640
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
things outside of work as well so these

641
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,799
don't have to be like they don't have to

642
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,559
be your best friend you have to like you

643
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
know really connect with them but you do

644
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,559
need to ask them personal questions like

645
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,480
how are things going at you know with

646
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
your family how are your kids how are

647
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
things at home because you know as well

648
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
as i do personal problems and things

649
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,080
going on at home will affect the the

650
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
workplace they just do they've affected

651
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,880
me i've needed time away for personal

652
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
things everybody does so you have to ask

653
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
those questions you have to show that

654
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
you care about that person on a personal

655
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,320
level because you do you're their leader

656
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
that's what they expect of you so

657
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,159
definitely have those conversations

658
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
um if you're still in an office i

659
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
recommend going for a walk going get

660
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
coffee they don't always have to be at

661
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
your desk

662
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
virtual coffee i guess if you're using

663
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
zoom

664
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,640
and then if there's nothing on the

665
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,039
agenda i mean just talk you can cut the

666
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,559
meeting short if you need to but just

667
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,159
check in and say hey how is everything

668
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,559
going anything you want to talk about

669
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,559
and then keep the meeting short but just

670
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,720
the fact that you prioritize that for

671
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,799
that employee goes a long way they may

672
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,200
not say it but they really really

673
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
appreciate that time with their boss um

674
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
i've talked to people that have said

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
that they've worked in organizations

676
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,559
where they haven't talked to their their

677
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,600
manager in months or weeks and and

678
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,360
that's really scary so don't be one of

679
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
those leaders where you're never talking

680
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,240
to your teams

681
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,200
the last thing i'll say about

682
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
one-on-ones is this is also where you

683
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,200
have those career conversations so you

684
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
can talk about hey so what you've been

685
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
thinking about training or you know what

686
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
do you think in the next couple years

687
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
you want to do and or hey i saw that

688
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,440
there's a an opening on in another

689
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
department that you might be a good fit

690
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,039
for you know these are the times to have

691
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
those conversations and don't do it

692
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,360
during like the annual review or the

693
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
mid-year review i mean you could

694
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
certainly do that but you should be

695
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,960
doing that outside of those those times

696
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,279
as well

697
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,880
so the skip level so for those of you

698
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
that are managing managers or you have a

699
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,559
manager in between

700
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
this is something that i also

701
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,679
recommend doing and i personally like to

702
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
see more executives doing this type of

703
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,559
thing

704
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
this means to skip over somebody's

705
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,279
manager

706
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,799
and it's that opportunity to find out

707
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,600
what's really going on the grounds

708
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,919
so those of you that know general james

709
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,919
mattis he's the former secretary of

710
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
defense a four-star marine general in

711
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
afghanistan iraq incredible leader

712
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
he had a book called call sign chaos

713
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
which is a great read but he talked

714
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
about how he would talk to the junior um

715
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,159
the junior ranks the lance corporals the

716
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,279
privates um quite frequently asking them

717
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,880
questions how are things going how are

718
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,200
you feeling um and this is a four-star

719
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
general like this guy is busy right i

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
mean he's got things to do but he took

721
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,520
the time to meet with the juniors the

722
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
junior people to really find out what's

723
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,559
going on

724
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
and um and since i've been doing this

725
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
especially in a director in an executive

726
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
position i've actually found out things

727
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
that my managers didn't even know like i

728
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
had a case of like

729
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
you know a bunch of people were having

730
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,600
laptop issues like they weren't telling

731
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
anybody that we had this patch that was

732
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,279
rolled out and nobody knew

733
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
but they told me and i was able to fix

734
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
it and i wouldn't have known that and my

735
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
managers probably were oblivious to it

736
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
but because i had that skip level i

737
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
found that out so

738
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
um the last thing i'll say about this

739
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,159
too is set expectations on why you're

740
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,679
meeting with them because sometimes when

741
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,039
they get an invite from you know

742
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
somebody higher up they're like oh i'm

743
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,120
in trouble what did i do the executive

744
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,679
or director wants to meet with me uh

745
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
um but literally put a sentence like hey

746
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,120
i just want to meet with you see how

747
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,559
things are going you know you're not in

748
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,159
trouble it's cool

749
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,760
but set that expectation with them it

750
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
really means a lot

751
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,760
so what makes a great team let's talk

752
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
about these four things these are four

753
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
areas that i found in my career

754
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
that make a incredible team

755
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,720
and the first is diversity so this has

756
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
been proven there's tons of studies you

757
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
could probably google and find on this

758
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,360
but diverse teams are the best teams

759
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
they really are

760
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,159
for lots of reasons but mainly because

761
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,880
different backgrounds different cultures

762
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,440
um varied personalities and different

763
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,679
skills brings a whole lot to the

764
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,559
holistic team to solve problems to work

765
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,600
on things together um it really is is

766
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
the best i i've i've been honored to be

767
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,320
worked working with so many

768
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,159
diverse teams in my career and i can

769
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
tell you that all of them have

770
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
eventually been high-performing teams

771
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,279
and i really believe it's because of the

772
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,399
diversity that we had um on that team

773
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,520
one thing one thing that's interesting

774
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,679
i'll share a quick story um and some of

775
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,679
you that have worked on this team may

776
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,320
realize um we were very open about

777
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,520
things like politics and i know politics

778
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
is a big hot button and other things

779
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
going on in the world and so we had a

780
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
chat you know going on just talking

781
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
about world events and things like that

782
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640
and i found it amazing that despite

783
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
political differences and different

784
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,360
opinions everybody could come together

785
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
and have respect for everybody else's

786
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,080
views and i thought that was really

787
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
really cool of course we had ground

788
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,480
rules right like be respectful you know

789
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,200
be kind all these things but

790
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
it amazed me that this team very diverse

791
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
team could still talk and i and i

792
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
thought to myself like could we why

793
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,919
can't we do this in the real world right

794
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
like with politicians and why can't

795
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
people come together and and i really

796
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,120
believe that's because of the diversity

797
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
and the respect that everybody on this

798
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,960
team had with one another it was really

799
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,679
amazing to see

800
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
so challenge so your team members have

801
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
to be challenged and they may not ask

802
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,440
you to be challenged but what they're

803
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
but they're they're secretly knowing

804
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,120
they're secretly saying they do want to

805
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
be challenged so i think it's kind of a

806
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
myth that you get quiet more introverted

807
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
people that say i just want to do my job

808
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
like i don't want to do anything else

809
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
and i found that they actually want to

810
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
be challenged but no one has actually

811
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
challenged them in the past they

812
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
probably never had a a manager or a

813
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,440
leader that said hey you know

814
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,960
i want you to do this project because i

815
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
think you can do it i know you don't

816
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
think you can but i know you can um and

817
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,520
so i've always challenged individuals

818
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,120
that were more on the introverted side

819
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,320
and kind of brought them out of their

820
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
shell and and they appreciated that i

821
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,679
had people thank me it's like hey thanks

822
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,120
for putting on that project i really

823
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,320
like that

824
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,799
i learned a ton and can i do another one

825
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,600
right

826
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,880
and this is coming from introverted

827
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,440
people um but you want to kind of divvy

828
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
things up in terms of like giving people

829
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,360
work that's different work that pushes

830
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
their limits um and of course work that

831
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,279
has a purpose like we all want to do a

832
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
job that has a purpose it's really

833
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,120
important to our our human well-being

834
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,799
and then communication right big theme

835
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
about this this talk is communication

836
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
and and communication is really

837
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
consistent it has to be consistent it

838
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,640
has to go both ways so it can't be one

839
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,360
way right can't be all you communicating

840
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
your team has to communicate back to you

841
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
as well it has to be there has to be

842
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,240
feedback around that that communication

843
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,720
lessons learned and follow-up is really

844
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,840
important

845
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,760
um

846
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,120
you know i've seen

847
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,279
you know communication go really good

848
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
and really bad and i think a good

849
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
example of that is like data breach

850
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,679
notifications right it's the good and

851
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,840
the bad and the ugly um so if you want

852
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
to see like you know how a company

853
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,320
responds to a data breach and you do you

854
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
know hopefully you're you're in full

855
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,840
disclosure and you're responding you're

856
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,039
talking about what really happened and

857
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,159
all those things but there are some

858
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,520
companies that don't say anything or

859
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,679
they don't do anything until later so

860
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,360
keeping that in mind just for how you

861
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,520
communicate with your team uh can go a

862
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,000
long way

863
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,640
respect i mentioned respect already um

864
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
but this is also i think one of the most

865
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,960
important aspects of a great team and i

866
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,120
think respect starts with empathy as

867
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,960
well um we'll talk about empathy in a

868
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,840
minute but um this is empathy for your

869
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,760
team members um

870
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,279
and making sure that they have empathy

871
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,320
with each other as well um and so that's

872
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
part of building that culture within

873
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,360
your team um and so that also includes

874
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,240
kindness as well um you know i think we

875
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,039
all would say we have a no rule

876
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,159
right on the team of like who we hire um

877
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,760
but we need people to be kind and we

878
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
also need people to be self-aware of of

879
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,000
who they are what they're bringing to

880
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
the table

881
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,960
how they respond to angry customers

882
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,320
angry employees from other departments

883
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,240
all of that is is about generating

884
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
respect

885
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,200
and i like this quote it's it's really

886
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
like a mirror so the more you show it to

887
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,960
others the more that they will show it

888
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
to you

889
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,679
so i wanted to quickly talk about a team

890
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,760
charter and there's lots of information

891
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
on the internet about team charters and

892
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,880
you can do them in different ways i've

893
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,120
got a link at the end that you can check

894
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
out if you're looking for like kind of a

895
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,640
template like a general template for a

896
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
team charter

897
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
but i really find a lot of value in this

898
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
because it kind of levels the playing

899
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,799
field in terms of making sure everybody

900
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,440
is on the same page on your team so it

901
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
defines the mission

902
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
a vision for your team like what are we

903
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,000
doing what is the purpose of our work

904
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
what are our goals what are we trying to

905
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
accomplish because you'd be surprised a

906
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,000
lot of people they don't know they know

907
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
they're doing a job but they don't know

908
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,640
why they're doing that job so as leaders

909
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,799
we're here to define that for them and

910
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,200
and set them in the right direction

911
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,480
right

912
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,360
it also outlines expectations so

913
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,760
outlining what's the expectation of your

914
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,519
role so like in my world what's the

915
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,360
expectation of a senior consultant

916
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
compared to a consultant three there's

917
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,679
very different expectations but that

918
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,039
those are not communicated and

919
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,519
documented they're again left to figure

920
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,760
that out for themselves and that never

921
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
ends well

922
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,799
um the other thing i'll mention about a

923
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,960
team charter it's a living document it's

924
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
not meant to be set in stone it's not

925
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,840
meant to be you know this is this is it

926
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,399
this is and we're never changing it um i

927
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
actually revise mine every couple months

928
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,399
um six months what i recommend twice a

929
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
year is good um and you meet with the

930
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,279
team meet with your leaders and talk

931
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,960
about like what's working what's not and

932
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,200
where do we need to make changes but um

933
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,519
i found this is a great way to just put

934
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,840
everybody on the same page

935
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,440
so just some examples and i'll just take

936
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
bishop fox as an example um what do we

937
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,760
mean by like a mission statement and a

938
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,159
vision statement so for bishop fox

939
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,519
mission so it's defending forward to

940
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,279
safeguard our digital world it's very

941
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,519
straightforward very simple easy to

942
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,640
understand

943
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,880
these things don't have to be complex

944
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
i know there's some companies out there

945
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,919
that put a lot of time and marketing

946
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
effort into that vision that mission and

947
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,919
vision statement there's tons out there

948
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
you could probably google

949
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
but make it very simple you know why are

950
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,159
we here what is it that we're doing

951
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,000
and then the vision so to be the most

952
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,760
advanced admirer defensive cyber

953
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,200
operations team

954
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
and then for your own team so if you're

955
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,279
in a smaller team or a department break

956
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,519
that down into what what are you trying

957
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,600
to do so in my area of the business it's

958
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,960
to have the best defensive security

959
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
offerings in the industry it's very

960
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
clear concise and sets everybody in the

961
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,480
same path that's all it needs to be

962
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,159
so here's an example just some rules and

963
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,480
responsibilities and at least how i d

964
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,039
i've done it over the years um so this

965
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,840
is defining and setting uh expectations

966
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,240
for each role within your team and what

967
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,039
i've done is i've broken those out into

968
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,840
very specific categories so some of

969
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
those categories could be you know

970
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,918
professional development communication

971
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,839
mentoring business development just

972
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,760
depends on your business and and what

973
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,359
categories of those roles that you're

974
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,800
trying to define

975
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,079
and that's really going to vary on your

976
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,199
business

977
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
but you need to document it and you need

978
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,960
to communicate it so don't leave this

979
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
like on your desktop or you know

980
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,440
somewhere where nobody can find it i

981
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,199
recommend using like an internal

982
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,839
internet or a wiki or some other place

983
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,000
that everybody can see it it's pinned

984
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,159
everybody understands where it's at and

985
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
then it's updated

986
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,079
so it's very important

987
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,918
to also reference this in your

988
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,560
one-on-ones so when someone is thinking

989
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,520
about hey how do i get promoted to be a

990
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,760
senior consultant as an example i show

991
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,480
them this we talk about it and now they

992
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,639
have clear expectations of okay so i

993
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,040
need to be working towards this role and

994
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,680
doing these things and showing you know

995
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
that i'm capable of being promoted into

996
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,000
this role it makes it really clear right

997
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,359
because it's documented and it's

998
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,839
understood

999
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
so let's jump into hiring what a great

1000
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,800
conversation right we love hiring

1001
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,520
because you know there's so many jobs we

1002
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,079
need to fill right in this industry not

1003
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,440
enough people i know there's a lot of

1004
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,800
debate about that

1005
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
some people say it's more about lack of

1006
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,480
skills versus lack of people and you

1007
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
know we won't have that debate here but

1008
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,200
um we need to ask ourselves like who do

1009
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,480
we hire and how do we hire correctly or

1010
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
at least as best as we can so we're

1011
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,520
making the best decisions uh on who's

1012
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
we're bringing on to our team

1013
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,160
um and a lot of this comes down to you

1014
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,839
know looking at who you have on your

1015
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,839
team looking at their skills

1016
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,400
looking at yourself and you know what

1017
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,040
are my weaknesses like what do i what do

1018
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
i need to fill in maybe what are some

1019
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,599
things i don't do as well as i should

1020
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,040
and where could i bring someone in to

1021
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,720
help with that so i'm not sure if anyone

1022
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,000
knows or heard of sarah blakely um yes

1023
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,880
yeah sarah blakely is awesome she

1024
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
founded spanx which is actually

1025
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,839
a billion dollar business now

1026
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,520
i definitely recommend you like kind of

1027
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,119
reading more about her

1028
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,880
because she has an incredible background

1029
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,599
with she had tons of failures in her

1030
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,079
career she had um

1031
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
lots of experiences that set her back

1032
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,880
but she could overcome a lot all those

1033
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
and a lot of it was because of the

1034
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
people she hired and the people that

1035
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,000
she's surrounded herself with so she's

1036
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,480
very inspiring from that and uh really

1037
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,599
is an example of of uh hiring for your

1038
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,119
weakness and something we should all

1039
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,680
think about too

1040
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,240
so with that it kind of leads us into

1041
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
emotional intelligence and one of the

1042
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,359
arguments that maybe not really

1043
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,359
arguments but i've had with uh some

1044
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,119
other leaders is

1045
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,720
should we prioritize

1046
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
emotional intelligence over technical

1047
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
ability

1048
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,400
that's a good debate right because we

1049
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,320
need people with technical skills to do

1050
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
the technical jobs but we also need

1051
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,200
those people to have well people skills

1052
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,320
right they need to be able to

1053
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
communicate they need to have empathy

1054
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,520
they need to know

1055
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,320
you know

1056
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
they're not going to get angry at every

1057
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
little thing right they had to have

1058
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,599
self-control all those things so in my

1059
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,920
eyes i kind of value

1060
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
eq a little bit over technical skills

1061
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
because i look at technical skills

1062
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,320
you're coming in the door with those and

1063
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,640
those can probably learn and adapted and

1064
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,599
that's great um but i'll value the the

1065
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,680
eq a little bit more and it's something

1066
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,280
that i focus more on during my

1067
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,119
interviews that tells me a lot about a

1068
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,200
person and if they're capable of doing

1069
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,040
the job and doing the work even from a

1070
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,880
technical ability because of those those

1071
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
people skills they're still very

1072
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
important

1073
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,000
the other thing you'll find about

1074
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,720
emotional intelligence is it actually

1075
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
increases with experience so as you kind

1076
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
of grow your career as a leader you'll

1077
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,920
kind of find that you'll be more

1078
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,599
empathetic you'll

1079
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,480
develop better social skills um i found

1080
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,040
that myself um especially with empathy

1081
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,400
that was something very hard for me

1082
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,640
early on in my career and now i can say

1083
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
that i'm doing it much more i'm doing a

1084
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,720
lot better than i used to because it's

1085
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,920
something that can be learned and

1086
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
improved on so you may think like you

1087
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,920
don't have a lot of self-awareness as an

1088
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,000
example right now but that can change if

1089
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
you put some effort and time into it

1090
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,720
so let's talk about self-awareness so

1091
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,880
this is about recognizing how our

1092
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,000
emotions affect our performance

1093
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,960
so

1094
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
uh

1095
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,520
you know do you let your emotions get

1096
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,480
the better of you right do you get angry

1097
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
and then kind of freak out and then need

1098
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,880
to go away and you know think about what

1099
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,200
you just did right go into the corner

1100
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,920
right you've done something bad

1101
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,079
but think about your team do they know

1102
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,440
their limits

1103
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,280
and their abilities

1104
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
this is hard right everybody has a

1105
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,119
different level of self-awareness so we

1106
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,720
have to think about that and we have to

1107
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,440
coach our team through that as well

1108
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,040
one thing i know we talk about a lot

1109
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,079
about on our teams is burnout

1110
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,640
how do you know when you're burned out

1111
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,720
yourself but also how do you know and

1112
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
identify when one of your employees is

1113
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
burned out and a lot of that again is

1114
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,040
about asking questions right don't

1115
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,800
assume that your employee is going to

1116
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
come to you and say i'm burned out i

1117
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
need time off i need to do something

1118
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
different nine out of 10 times they're

1119
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
not going to say that to you it's you

1120
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
that has to ask that question you have

1121
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,920
to phrase it in a way where you're

1122
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,560
coming across with kindness with caring

1123
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,960
and really understanding um you know

1124
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
where they're at

1125
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,839
so there's some things that we could you

1126
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,520
know think about when you consider

1127
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,760
burnouts and some identifiers of that

1128
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
but it really comes down to asking

1129
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,839
questions

1130
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,119
self-regulation so this is about

1131
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,359
controlling or redirecting one's

1132
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,680
disruptive impulses

1133
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
so especially in a professional setting

1134
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,280
so have anybody ever seen someone

1135
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,079
completely freak out on the job and

1136
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
start yelling screaming

1137
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,079
just totally unprofessional behavior

1138
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
i've seen it on like conference calls i

1139
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,440
remember this one conference call i was

1140
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,839
on where a customer literally started

1141
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,079
swearing at a sales person and just

1142
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,760
going completely off and the sales

1143
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
person was just like

1144
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,599
i'm sorry but that is inappropriate i'm

1145
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,599
pretty offended by this you know i think

1146
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,240
you should give me an apology and the

1147
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,599
customer is like

1148
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,760
i'm sorry you're right i freaked out i'm

1149
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,079
sorry i didn't mean to swear at you but

1150
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,480
those types of moments somebody has lost

1151
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
self-control um and for whatever reason

1152
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,240
and so we have to think about that of

1153
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,880
could our own team members do that right

1154
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,319
um and so one thing i want to mention

1155
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,079
too is like change who likes change

1156
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,240
some people thrive on change but most of

1157
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
us as humans hate change right that's

1158
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
just in our nature we don't like change

1159
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
well guess what when changes happen in

1160
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
the organization you and your team

1161
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
members are going to go through change

1162
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,599
as well

1163
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,359
and so there's some techniques that you

1164
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,839
can do to kind of help help your

1165
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,000
employees through that change

1166
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,160
one thing i recommend is this uh change

1167
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,920
cycle i had some training on this a

1168
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
couple years ago and i thought it was

1169
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
amazing so you know thinking about lost

1170
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,920
doubt discomfort discovery understanding

1171
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,599
and integration those are the stages

1172
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,440
that everybody goes through with any

1173
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,119
kind of change personal business

1174
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,880
whatever it is

1175
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,839
but check that out and think about how

1176
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
your team and you handle change in your

1177
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
organization

1178
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
social skill so this is about managing

1179
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,160
relationships

1180
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,880
so how do your team communicate and

1181
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,400
interact with others

1182
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,680
um can they influence and persuade in a

1183
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,240
positive way right maybe not social

1184
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
engineering for manipulation but

1185
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,880
actually persuading people um

1186
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,280
so this is a skill that people can learn

1187
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,760
um do they delegate um do they support

1188
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,240
others on the team um this is all about

1189
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,640
social skill um this is another one

1190
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
where i think introverts kind of get a

1191
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,359
bad rap here um just because someone is

1192
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
quiet or a little more introverted

1193
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,760
doesn't mean they have no social skills

1194
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,000
um you know sometimes they just need a

1195
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
little bit of push sometimes they just

1196
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,680
need communicated to and talk to

1197
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,160
and uh and they'll start communicating

1198
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
so

1199
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,640
and this is the big one i think empathy

1200
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
um this is something that we all

1201
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,240
struggle with at some at some level um

1202
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,560
but how often do you put yourself in

1203
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,880
somebody else's shoes

1204
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,400
do your employees

1205
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,480
take an active interest in the concerns

1206
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,160
of their other teammates their other

1207
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
employees

1208
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,920
others outside of your team i know in

1209
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,680
the consulting world there's kind of a

1210
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,839
you know oh the sales people we don't

1211
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,520
like talking to them we don't want to be

1212
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,079
part of sales right and so and some of

1213
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,599
that comes from lack of empathy we don't

1214
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,520
really understand their job we don't

1215
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,359
understand what they do maybe we didn't

1216
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,920
even take the time to ask or understand

1217
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,200
their job

1218
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
so we need to think about that of like

1219
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
how can we have more empathy with each

1220
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,160
other and um that can make a huge

1221
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,920
difference but it's hard it's something

1222
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,839
that everybody needs to work on and

1223
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,839
frankly i think that lack of empathy is

1224
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,480
a huge problem in the world in general

1225
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,079
and it's probably a big reason why we

1226
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,680
have so many issues going on with

1227
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,280
politics and all these other things

1228
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
because of that lack of empathy and we

1229
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,599
need to change that

1230
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,680
motivation so we're going to talk about

1231
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,280
motivators here in the next couple

1232
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,240
slides but um this is important right so

1233
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,040
being driven uh to achieve for the sake

1234
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,839
of achievement right um i like this uh

1235
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,680
this motivational poster right work

1236
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,240
harder or will fire you

1237
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,319
i like the motivational ones better yeah

1238
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,200
definitely um but when hiring people we

1239
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
have to ask and think about what's going

1240
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,400
to motivate them

1241
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,079
um and i will tell you that it's not

1242
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,760
always about money

1243
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,119
that's always the first thing people say

1244
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,400
it was like we'll just pay you more

1245
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,000
we'll give you a big bonus and that's

1246
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,359
all you're going to need well people

1247
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,200
want a lot more than just money and it

1248
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
comes down to what motivates them and

1249
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
we'll talk about some different ways

1250
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
that people like to be motivated that

1251
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,839
hopefully you can look at back at your

1252
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,920
team on your teams

1253
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,240
and help them get motivated

1254
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,640
so talking about interviewing so

1255
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
um i wanted to share a couple of my

1256
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,880
favorite questions that i like to ask to

1257
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,599
kind of call out eq and

1258
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,760
see what level at they're at in terms of

1259
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,079
their their level of eq um and this

1260
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,359
starts with things like asking about

1261
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,280
what they're what's their passion so how

1262
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,040
do you define success

1263
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,960
um define an environment which you would

1264
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,200
not thrive in that's always a good one

1265
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,800
right and usually they'll talk about

1266
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,400
like maybe their current environment or

1267
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,000
their current job role and ask them

1268
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,359
we'll talk more about that you know what

1269
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,599
would you like to see in this new role

1270
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,520
what are you most proud of i love that

1271
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,599
question and a lot of times it doesn't

1272
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,280
have anything to do with work it's like

1273
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,119
you know i'm most proud of my kids or

1274
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
i'm most proud of i got this trophy when

1275
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,200
i was on this baseball team i mean like

1276
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,040
it could be anything but it gets them

1277
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,599
talking and you really get to understand

1278
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,680
a person and their personality by just

1279
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,599
asking questions like that

1280
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,240
but my favorite question of all

1281
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,359
is kind of a twist on the you know

1282
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,200
what's your weakness question because

1283
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
everybody hates that right what's my

1284
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,960
weakness oh yeah well ask this next time

1285
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,839
is what's the biggest misperception that

1286
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,680
people have of you

1287
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,359
and every time i ask that question

1288
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,480
they'll say

1289
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,319
that's interesting i haven't thought

1290
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,560
about that and you will get some very

1291
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,440
creative answers to that that kind of

1292
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,839
pull out some weakness

1293
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,400
right but also gives them a chance to

1294
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,680
really think about how they're going to

1295
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,359
answer that question

1296
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,880
so it's not a trick question it's not

1297
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,319
meant to stump them or anything but

1298
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,240
really meant to get them to think

1299
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,920
and i always love the answers that i get

1300
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,560
from that question

1301
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,880
so old macdonald had a farm

1302
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,119
e-i-e-i-o right yes um

1303
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,720
i will not quit my day job being a

1304
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,839
singer but

1305
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,000
old macdonald had a farm this is an

1306
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,480
acronym that you can use um

1307
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,839
which stands for

1308
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,800
e is energy and enthusiasm so

1309
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,160
thinking about these things when you're

1310
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,760
doing the interview are they passionate

1311
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,079
excited energized about your work i mean

1312
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,000
there's no the worst interviews in the

1313
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,839
world or when someone comes in just like

1314
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,160
they look bored they don't want to be

1315
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,400
there i think we've all experienced that

1316
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,000
you want someone that's energized ready

1317
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,599
to go they're excited about the job

1318
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,440
that's the first thing you look for

1319
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,640
intelligence

1320
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,960
are they smart you can usually figure

1321
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,720
this out pretty quickly just in like

1322
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,040
five minutes of a conversation you're

1323
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,800
not giving them a test right of course

1324
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,160
there may be things they'll be doing on

1325
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,400
a technical aptitude test or they're

1326
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,560
doing like a mini pen test in our world

1327
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,760
or something like that the show

1328
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,839
technical skill but you want to look for

1329
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,359
intelligent right do they know what

1330
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,280
they're talking about is is the bottom

1331
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,000
line experience um have they been in

1332
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,240
similar roles um what have they learned

1333
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
so ask them questions like what did you

1334
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,599
learn in your next role how is that role

1335
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,599
going to help you in this role um and

1336
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,440
seeing how they answer

1337
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,079
integrity this is an absolute

1338
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,440
requirement if you have a candidate that

1339
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,599
doesn't show integrity is either you

1340
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,319
catch them lying you catch them cheating

1341
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,480
it's an instant no right you cannot have

1342
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,640
people with a lack of integrity on your

1343
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
team

1344
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,119
and then organizational fit so this is

1345
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,359
about culture so everybody should

1346
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,200
hopefully know the the culture of your

1347
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,480
organization

1348
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,440
um and are they gonna fit um personality

1349
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,200
wise it's really important you don't

1350
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,640
want to bring someone in there that's

1351
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,480
gonna just like a bull in the china shop

1352
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,559
going to start you know wrecking havoc

1353
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,640
you've got to keep that culture so we

1354
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
have to keep that together

1355
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,880
so the other thing i'll mention here

1356
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,480
pretty quickly is this thing called the

1357
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,599
20 60 20 rule has anyone heard of this

1358
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,880
before

1359
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,480
this is this is a pretty cool technique

1360
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,800
to kind of identify where your team is

1361
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,599
at

1362
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,599
um so for example

1363
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,880
the top 20 drive 80 of the results which

1364
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,200
is your positives and the bottom 20 fall

1365
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,359
under two categories of negatives so

1366
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,680
they're either skill based issues or

1367
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,960
there's attitude behavior issues but 60

1368
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,680
make up most of your staff um and so

1369
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,359
we'll talk about in a minute here about

1370
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,200
where you need to spend your time in

1371
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
terms of your team

1372
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,640
so the top 20 they're already

1373
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,240
self-motivated you probably know who

1374
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,440
these people are in your team they're

1375
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,760
your high performers

1376
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,200
you should you know you still need to

1377
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,040
spend time with them

1378
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
but not as much as you would expect

1379
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,160
because they're already doing the job

1380
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,240
that you want them to do and more

1381
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,599
you should spend the least amount of

1382
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,319
time with the bottom 20 and we'll get to

1383
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,720
why in a minute but that's the least

1384
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,359
effective your time but the best use of

1385
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,880
your time is to spend time on that

1386
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,800
middle 60 because they have the most

1387
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,680
potential they can grow into that top 20

1388
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,280
and really makes up the bulk of your

1389
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,800
team

1390
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,480
so how do you identify the top 20 well

1391
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,400
like i said these are your stars you

1392
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,559
know who they are they're self-motivated

1393
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,720
they're always coming to you with

1394
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,800
you know situations that they want to be

1395
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,119
involved with they're solving problems

1396
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,640
they're just on it right they know what

1397
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,240
they're doing you love hanging on the

1398
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,559
team you can give them any project they

1399
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,160
excel at it

1400
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
and these are the people that we

1401
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,119
obviously want to keep around right

1402
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,280
they're your high performers

1403
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,960
the middle 60 these are your kind of

1404
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,599
good loyal workers right um they just

1405
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,280
need to know they're doing a good job

1406
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,880
they need sometimes a little bit more

1407
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,920
feedback

1408
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,079
um they're more of your followers than

1409
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,920
your leaders in an organization and

1410
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,559
that's totally okay um sometimes they

1411
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,559
avoid taking risks

1412
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,599
and they just want to play about the

1413
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,599
rules um what's interesting about the

1414
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,520
middle 60 is that they're kind of torn

1415
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,920
between following the top 20 and

1416
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,559
listening to the bottom 20. so um we'll

1417
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,680
talk about that in a second

1418
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,520
so your bottom 20. this should be pretty

1419
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,200
clear as well right they're the ones

1420
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,040
questioning authority they complain

1421
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,119
about the company and what the company

1422
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,240
is doing um they uh enjoy playing the

1423
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,800
victim right um and they have really

1424
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,440
just a poor attitude about everything

1425
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,880
um and then they're just difficult to

1426
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,000
engage in

1427
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,640
in

1428
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,800
in dialogue um what i find interesting

1429
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,359
about this is that there sometimes these

1430
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,440
are the high performers

1431
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
that have a bad attitude um

1432
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,599
and these are the ones that kind of

1433
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,520
become i'll call it a cancer here in the

1434
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,000
next slide but in your organization um

1435
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,440
and they kind of need to be removed

1436
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,559
eventually um if they don't change

1437
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,000
so what you do with the top 20. so you

1438
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
challenge them

1439
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,680
give them interesting assignments um

1440
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,839
reward learning and encouragement

1441
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,920
and then these are great for mentorships

1442
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,119
right pair them with other high

1443
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,640
performers in the company company

1444
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,079
executives even pair them with people

1445
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,480
from outside the organization

1446
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,720
what do you do with the middle 60 so

1447
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,319
these are the backbone of your team so

1448
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,599
you want to create an environment you

1449
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,440
know where they feel valued you're

1450
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,880
rewarding them for learning um and again

1451
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,640
thinking about mentorship you know pair

1452
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,240
them with other high performers as well

1453
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,800
maybe some of your top 20 and see

1454
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,880
how they can be developed

1455
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,520
bottom 20 they can be a cancer right

1456
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,119
they need to be removed if they don't

1457
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,880
change i kind of go with the three

1458
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,119
strike rule right you give them three

1459
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,880
chances to improve come to you with

1460
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,000
solutions or they're out right um

1461
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,160
unfortunately people in the bottom 20

1462
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,599
just negatively influence the

1463
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,160
organization we've all had them um in

1464
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
fact we had a few individuals that we've

1465
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,680
had to let go i've had other people in

1466
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,960
the team actually thank me are like

1467
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,480
we're glad so-and-so is no longer here

1468
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,720
because they're such a drain on our

1469
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,800
energy and they're so negative and

1470
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,040
really brought the team down so

1471
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,480
consider all that when you're looking at

1472
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,319
your team

1473
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,680
so real quick i know we only got a

1474
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,960
couple minutes left here so i'll talk

1475
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,280
about motivation so what motivates the

1476
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,960
team there's different types of

1477
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
motivators so there's intrinsic and

1478
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,359
extrinsic motivators and we all fall

1479
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,000
into these categories so these are

1480
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,319
intrinsic means you know you like

1481
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,200
belonging you have a curiosity you love

1482
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,960
what you're doing you're not necessarily

1483
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,839
looking for rewards like money or badges

1484
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,760
or other types of things but on the

1485
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,280
other side some people like that some

1486
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,920
people like badges some people like um

1487
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,520
fear of punishment right that's why

1488
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,119
those burn boot camps and other things

1489
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,640
are very popular because some people

1490
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
like getting yelled at to lose weight

1491
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,079
right that's just something of a

1492
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,240
motivator to them so we kind of have to

1493
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,760
put our team into these two different

1494
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,280
categories and think about how do they

1495
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,440
like being motivated and the way to do

1496
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,359
this is just to ask them how do you like

1497
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,960
being motivated is it money is it

1498
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,359
rewards is it public thanks ask them

1499
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,359
those

1500
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:17,839
um questions

1501
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:18,960
will talk a little about this because i

1502
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,400
know we're running out of time but

1503
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,319
mccullen's human motivation theory is

1504
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,559
something that's pretty cool um that you

1505
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,800
can uh find more about but everybody

1506
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,960
falls into these three categories you're

1507
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
either achievement affiliation and power

1508
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,520
and you have a dominant category um with

1509
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,000
like kind of a sub category but uh this

1510
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,480
is something you can check out and um i

1511
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,079
found a lot of value in it and how i

1512
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,319
categorize my team in terms of who's a

1513
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,240
high achiever versus who's more power

1514
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,280
hungry and those types of things

1515
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,520
personality types so i'm a big proponent

1516
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,760
of multiple personality tests so we've

1517
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,359
all heard of the enneagram the

1518
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,200
myers-briggs

1519
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,240
disc

1520
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,079
my favorite though is the process

1521
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,800
communication model um which is

1522
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,520
something used by nasa to

1523
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,440
to figure out the personality types of

1524
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,920
astronauts and astronauts obviously have

1525
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,599
to be of a certain personality type if

1526
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,359
you're going to space

1527
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,440
which is kind of neat so the thing i'll

1528
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,640
say on personality types is just

1529
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,960
remember that there is no one good

1530
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,880
personality test i would say take

1531
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,359
multiple of them and they all have an

1532
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,400
aspect

1533
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,240
of who you are

1534
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,160
and that's what i'll say about that um

1535
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,280
so no matter

1536
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,880
take the different tests and you'll find

1537
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,559
out you know the type of person that you

1538
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,760
are

1539
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,559
um lastly communication um the one thing

1540
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,400
i'll mention about this is always create

1541
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,960
an agenda for meetings

1542
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,400
hopefully all of you are thinking about

1543
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,079
that because i hate it when i get a

1544
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,920
meeting a meeting invite and there's no

1545
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,880
agenda like why am i here um what you

1546
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
know what am i doing right so as a

1547
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,880
leader always create a meeting agenda

1548
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,880
encourage your team to do the same

1549
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,079
and one thing i'll mention the last

1550
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,359
thing i'll mention about communication

1551
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,599
is well it takes seven times to get

1552
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,440
people to remember something

1553
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,680
so if you're not getting questions about

1554
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,839
what you just said then they probably

1555
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,359
didn't understand you and you probably

1556
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,599
didn't communicate it correctly so

1557
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,480
over communication if you can is really

1558
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,800
important

1559
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,640
coaching so let's jump right to

1560
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,559
we all know is a good coach

1561
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,599
but

1562
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,520
asking questions right so when you're in

1563
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,520
a coaching session

1564
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,359
you want to focus on questions of

1565
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,760
inquiry and curiosity so what could you

1566
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,359
have done differently what well or

1567
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,680
worked tell me more about that help me

1568
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,280
understand those are all phrases that

1569
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,680
you can use in a coaching session

1570
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,640
but first start with your observations

1571
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,440
invite their response to reactions

1572
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,520
don't interrupt always listen when

1573
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,720
you're coaching

1574
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,319
and then share your personal thoughts

1575
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,319
and reactions and then you work together

1576
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,760
on the solution that's the most

1577
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,119
important thing

1578
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,960
and then summarize right so sometimes

1579
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,200
that's in an email of hey this is what

1580
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,280
we talked about this is maybe a goal

1581
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,799
that we set for something to be

1582
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,040
accomplished and you have it on record

1583
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,880
right so an email follow-up is really

1584
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,319
important in any type of coaching

1585
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,319
session

1586
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,720
and just want to touch on career

1587
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,000
developments

1588
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,880
so

1589
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,480
i talked about career conversations

1590
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,440
early on but this is important right so

1591
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,119
we have to have these conversations to

1592
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,359
help develop our our team's skills and

1593
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,960
where they want to go in their careers

1594
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,359
but it's not about like completing forms

1595
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,520
like in an annual review these are about

1596
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,440
quality conversations we're having about

1597
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,480
about career so we want to explore

1598
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,400
possibilities and opportunities

1599
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,799
with our teams we want to get responses

1600
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,559
from them and we want to help and guide

1601
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,920
them through that but like i mentioned

1602
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,000
before employees really have to own that

1603
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,920
conversation but you need to guide them

1604
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,200
because a lot of times they're not going

1605
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,640
to tell you of like this is what i want

1606
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,799
to do in my career so you as a leader

1607
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:52,240
need to identify that for them

1608
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
so just to conclude hopefully we're

1609
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,799
right on time here um you know be very

1610
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,799
clear about your expectations like i

1611
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,200
said spend more time listening versus

1612
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,599
talking look for emotional intelligence

1613
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,599
in your hires prioritize one-on-one

1614
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:06,960
meetings

1615
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,319
apply that 2060 rule that i mentioned

1616
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,240
understand your team members talk to

1617
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,079
them work on your own communication

1618
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,200
style and who you are um and just let

1619
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,280
your team do great things right and

1620
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,799
they're gonna do great things if you're

1621
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,040
a great leader and you're inspiring them

1622
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
they're gonna do awesome things

1623
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,119
so here's a couple things just to finish

1624
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,520
up a couple books i recommend especially

1625
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,000
for new managers this book called the

1626
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,760
making of a manager i highly recommend

1627
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,680
if you're just getting into management

1628
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,839
existing managers hopefully you've heard

1629
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,359
of the five dysfunctions of the team

1630
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,200
this is a great book as well and then

1631
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,880
one thing around career conversations is

1632
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
help them grow or watch them go great

1633
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,240
title

1634
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
also a very good book on how to have

1635
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,680
better career conversations

1636
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,520
and just some other links and i will

1637
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,119
post this by the way

1638
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,440
if you follow me on twitter agent0x0

1639
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,319
i'll post this for you

1640
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,680
and i don't know if we have time for

1641
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,160
