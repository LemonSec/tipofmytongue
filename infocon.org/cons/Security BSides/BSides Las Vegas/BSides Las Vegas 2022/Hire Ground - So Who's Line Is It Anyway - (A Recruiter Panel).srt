3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,740
a a difficult position to do because

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,360
everyone's tired you had a late night

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,700

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,859
applaud those of you who came because

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,960

in this talk

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,039
Whose Line Is It Anyway

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,740
I should probably explain who I am I'm

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,500
Kathleen Smith Creator and director of

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,760
Higher Ground

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,279
and the two people to my left you're

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,620
right have been with me since the

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,719
beginning and I knew that I could count

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,940
on them to come and be part of this

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,040
conversation

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,020
throughout all of our conversations that

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,239
we've had at Higher Ground these two

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,820
days we've really talked about it from

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,579
the job Seekers perspective sort of

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,699
what do professional coaches what do

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,920
professionals in the community talk

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,940
about as far as how you move forward in

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,059
your career but we have not had any

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,840
conversations led by recruiters and if

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,299
you didn't realize it you actually are

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,760
going to have to talk to a recruiter at

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,580
some point in your career and at some

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,580
point during a specific job search so as

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,439
I said I have my two most wonderful

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,780
recruiters the third most wonderful

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,759
recruiter showing up later so we'll just

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,799
give him grief

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,380
um and we're going to talk about the

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,320
overall job search process and we invite

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,439
a lot of questions with that so to my

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,680
farthest left we have Kirsten Renner and

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,060
I'm going to have Kirsten sort of

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,460
explain who she is because if I do the

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,079
description I'd be going on for hours

42
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,479
and hours and hours so Kirsten tell us a

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,799
little bit about you

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,860
uh the community calls me crenner so

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,540
that's what you might know me by on

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,079
Twitter I am currently running the

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,520
recruiting team for the National

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,740
Security portfolio at Accenture Federal

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,280
services that was once Novato where I

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,219
was for uh six years and I have an

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,020
amazing team of recruiters several of

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,940
whom are here in the room with us and

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,280
when I hire managers this year

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,819
um I I help uh lead their requirements

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,420
analysis and Gathering and sorting of of

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,099
candidates and getting them lined up

57
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,520
against the managers and I also am a

58

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,700
so as you can see there are recruiters

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,580
who are involved in this community and

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,739
you can network with them you don't have

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,300
to just talk to them when you're

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,220

Chris is one of those rare exceptions

70
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,319
that I allow him to be involved in

71
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,140
everything because he knows how to be

72
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,739

73
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,540

96

through what they're looking for and why

97
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,459
they're struggling Consulting with them

98
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,959
about what's really out there in the

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,000
market and then other than that I've got

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
a whole load of other hats I've got a

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,860
non-profit I founded I've co-founded

102
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,019
that's trying to provide more diversity

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,540
in GRC and cyber security it's an

104
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,840
apprenticeship program completely free

105
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,399
and I've been involved with the cloud

106
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,199
security Alliance for a very long time

107
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
so very involved in the community and I

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,160
absolutely love it and love Kathleen and

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,199
every everybody that's involved with

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,780
helping make us do what we do

111
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,560
so yeah Chris gave this absolute

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,960
hilarious videotape

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,979
um seven years ago at uh what was called

114
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,100
just the career track in 2015 it was all

115
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,660
of the things that you should not do

116
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,520
with an interview and I really think you

117
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,500
you need to bring that back

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,340
so what we have here on the panel is we

119
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,380
have what is called a direct recruiter

120
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,979
someone who actually works for a company

121
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,800
and finds people to fill roles and then

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,419
we have someone who is part of a

123
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,440
staffing firm who works with clients so

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,360
Kirsten let's talk more about what your

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,060
specific role is and explaining what a

126
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,120
direct recruiter is

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,120
um my specific role is for leading a

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,620
team of of full life cycle recruiters uh

129
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,000
I want to talk a little bit more about

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
what their desk looks like because

131
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,479
that's really relevant uh to the

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,300
conversation they're connected to what

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,039
what we call our customers is the

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,020
internal hiring managers within the

135
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,139
company that we work for and so we have

136
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,780
we have leads who are connected to all

137
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,820
of those delivery teams so they're

138
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,280
understanding on a on at least a weekly

139
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
basis if not a daily basis what their

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
priorities look like based on who their

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
end customers are what they need

142
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
um there may be surge activities that

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,479
they need to go through for a proposal

144
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,820
that they're trying to get people for

145
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,919
and so forth but on a day-to-day basis

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,020
the recruiters the full life cycle

147
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,759
recruiters are going to spend time

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,039
sourcing they're going to Source in the

149
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,080
places where you are making yourselves

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,660
known as available talent and more

151
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,340
importantly they're going to be doing

152
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,800
activities like uh all the things you

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
see across all of these conferences this

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,419
week where they're networking with

155
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,639
people who might be passive or who might

156
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,560
not have resumes yet or who are just

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,199
getting started in their Journey their

158
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,759
day is going to be split up from

159
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
sourcing scheduling spending time with

160
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,800
the hiring managers and talking to you

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,660
all and and getting all those screenings

162
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,139
done so that they can then lead you

163
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,340
through your journey within the company

164
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,199
line you up against the right hiring

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,000
managers and hiring teams

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,100
so I just want to clarify one thing that

167
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,460
Kirsten said which is she has internal

168
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,160
customers internal customers are

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,740
actually government contracts that she

170
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,380
is supporting so she needs to go out and

171
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,300
make sure that her internal customers

172
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,639
who are various different agencies

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,699
various different contracts so it's

174
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,319
still a customer it's still someone

175
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,199
inside but it is the same cultivation

176
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,400
that is going on so Chris let's counter

177
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
that with what kind of role you have and

178
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,460
what your customers are okay yeah so as

179
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,020
an agency recruiter it's a little

180
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,199
different so we do something uh that's

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,020
called Full desk recruitment so the

182
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,240
often the same people that are talking

183
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,860
to candidates and finding them for jobs

184
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,479
are actually going out and actually

185
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,960
finding new new clients new hiring

186
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,479
managers that would be at various

187
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,520
different companies so we would actually

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,000
have you know various companies that we

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,460
search for and we might only work with

190
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,500
some of the hiring managers in some

191
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,300
other companies we work with whole teams

192
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,039
and and we'll be providing all of their

193
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,379
staff so it's it's unusual in the

194
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,560
instead of internal clients or internal

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,580
customers ours are external customers so

196
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,440
um you know there might be somebody like

197
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,919
Sony for instance as a customer of ours

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,720
we'll work with just their cyber

199
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,879
security team or in some cases we might

200
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,860
just work with their incident response

201
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,020
team so we have developed those

202
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,780
different relationships constantly but

203
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,419
then we're very involved in in filling

204
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,220
roles all over the country so we'll

205
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,740
differ how it's certainly changed over

206
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,960
the last couple of years I'd say but um

207
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,940
certainly you know we're very involved

208
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,400
in local community to find people but

209
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
also you know LinkedIn I'm sure we're

210
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,819
going to get to some of that stuff but

211
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,979
it differs a little bit in terms of

212
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,080
probably who our customers are and how

213
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,580
we connect with them some of them we

214
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,740
might have weekly catch-up calls if

215
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,940
we've got a particularly important

216
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,039
search on we might catch up with him

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,019
every single week other times it can be

218
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,640
very transactional so it could literally

219
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
be a four-week search get them placed

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,260
follow it all the way through to the

221
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,300
actual placement and then making sure

222
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,220
that that person's settled

223
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,640
so one thing that a lot of job Seekers

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,920
do not understand and and it's amazing

225
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,140
that I'll get this call I'll get this

226
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,180
request that will say

227
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,720
I had one call why am I why don't I have

228
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
the job

229
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
and I have to explain to a lot of people

230
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,500
don't quit your job until you know where

231
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,660
you are in the process for the next job

232
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,820
I deal with a lot of transitioning

233
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,760
military folks and they wait until their

234
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,980
last week before they're leaving service

235
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,420
to start looking for a job so Kirsten

236
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,180
how long does it take and what are the

237
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,279
different steps between your initial

238
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,060
Outreach to someone actually onboarding

239
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,899
oh wow do you mean for the candidates

240
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,940
Journey what they are the candidates

241
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,760
Journey from Outreach

242
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,100
all the different steps and then they

243
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,779
finally get the offer and they're

244
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,019
onboarded

245
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,420
so this this this uh it depends

246
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,180
obviously right uh it how long it takes

247
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,339
you to get the get connected to the

248
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,700
right person if you are fortunate if you

249
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,440
uh work with somebody like like in

250
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,300
Chris's group for example

251
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,620
um they're they're going to be like like

252
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,540
your personal agents and they're going

253
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,640
to walk you through the steps the best

254
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,100
recruiters are going to guide you

255
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,079
through what to expect Nest so depending

256
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,200
on either the contract or the customer

257
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,000
and what their requirements are whether

258
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,740
or not they require an extra background

259
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,420
investigation whether or not they

260
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,880
require like a customer Fit review

261
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,920
different different customers put

262
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,019
different things in the journey right so

263
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,720
it's not a good straight answer

264
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,360
um ideally I want to meet you I want to

265
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,980
have a conversation with you and as soon

266
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,019
as I've established Mutual you know

267
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,940
interest with you I'd like to go

268
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,839
straight to offer but so my my intention

269
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,380
is always to get there as fast as I can

270
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,180
but there's uh you know if there there's

271
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,800
a clearance requirement if there's a

272
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,660
background investigation requirement all

273
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,640
those things are going to add days and

274
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,779
sometimes weeks to the process

275
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,579
I tell all marketers and they cannot

276
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,339
well they're not paying attention

277
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,160
they are doing resume review not not

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,680
your head if it's true I say customize

279
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,140
the experience to the candidate right

280
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,200
take care of them schedule around them

281
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,540
Force the managers to get together with

282
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,740
them if there's three managers

283
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,720
interested cool more opportunities for

284
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,940
them they all got to show up when the

285
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,180
candidate is is available so that is the

286
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,920
ideal experience so that you're not

287
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,300
having to run through multiple

288
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,700
interviews I hate that I hate that that

289
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,880
does occur but if it does I mean imagine

290
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,980
the scheduling and all of that right so

291
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
this process I like to keep it inside of

292
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,940
30 days

293
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,779
to be there I I have a company that I

294
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,779
worked with and it took 18 months from

295
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,500
the original interaction until the

296
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
onboarding and the candidate actually

297
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,600
went and got another job while they were

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,060
waiting for this process so

299
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,240
please realize that you've got a long

300
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,459
timeline on this Chris how about your

301
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,899
candidates

302
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,700
um so yeah it's a bit of an it depends

303
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,820
on the client um often but uh probably a

304
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,860
good way to describe that when we're

305
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,839
involved in this process so the first

306
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,220
thing we'll do is sit down with the

307
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,339
client and find out why the roles open

308
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,240
often they're coming to us because

309
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,560
they've already tried to fill it

310
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,800
internally and using maybe internal

311
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,420
Talent acquisition or sometimes Talent

312
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,740
acquisition is just so busy that they

313
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,420
just need some assistance and some help

314
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,880
our companies most of them are

315
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,100
commercial less public sector and

316
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
defense which does mean they can be a

317
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
little bit more agile and one of the

318
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,820
priorities one of the ways we prioritize

319
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,220
our roles is to look at what are they

320
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,339
looking for does that person exist do

321
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,320
they skills go together

322
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,959
um and then what is their process so

323
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,300
you know is their process five

324
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
interviews in a panel and it's going to

325
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,139
take a month that's not going to be very

326
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,760
good for us because the candidates that

327
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,380
we give them are not going to probably

328
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,300
be available by the time they finish

329
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,040
their process

330
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,540
um so we always have a very good

331
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,920
understanding of what that specific

332
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,959
process is and we will talk about that

333
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,300
with a candidate so something that you

334
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,279
all could do is just ask that question

335
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,860
what is the process how how long is it

336
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,420
typically

337
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,519
um and we've had roles that have been

338
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,660
filled in as quick as two weeks maybe

339
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,940
probably would have even been a week but

340
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,000
but two weeks is is is is probably the

341
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,760
quickest up to four weeks

342
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,500
um and the quicker the clients can move

343
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,360
the higher up the priority list they are

344
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,579
for us to to work on their jobs

345
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,860
so let's dive into this a little bit

346
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,040
more deeply and what are the different

347
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,079
steps because a lot of times people

348
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,660
think it's just a phone interview or

349
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,060
it's just uh this or it's adjusted that

350
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,699
and with all of these roles there are

351
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,380
many different levels there are many

352
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,779
different customers who have to be

353
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,540
satisfied so Chris why don't you start

354
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,519
with sort of you know because it's not

355
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,800
just one phone call one meeting right

356
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,420
and we want to make sure that everyone

357
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,820
who's in the room is prepared for the

358
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,199
various different levels that they're

359
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,060
going to go through yeah certainly so

360
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,120
what you typically find is for us anyway

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,860
you'll you know you'll send a resume

362
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,320
you'll connect with somebody we will

363
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,240
have a qualification call with you which

364
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,279
is normally just a general call find out

365
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,260
what you're looking for

366
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,079
um what your salary requirements are why

367
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,579
you're looking to move on from where you

368
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,620
are currently and what your goals are

369
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,779
and then we might straight away or

370
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,519
immediately have a position in mind for

371
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,560
you in which case we can then talk about

372
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,000
a specific position

373
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,100
or we might call you back at a later

374
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,839
date with a specific position so that's

375
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,420
the first part once we've qualified you

376
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,220
for a specific role we send the resume

377
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,920
across to the client sometimes we work

378
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
in partnership with Talent acquisition

379
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,720
other times we'll be working directly

380
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,060
um with the line managers as well we

381
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,380
always find it's important to make sure

382
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,000
the talent acquisition is on board with

383
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
whatever we're doing in that process

384
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,920
um so we'll get get the resume across

385
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,899
we'll then follow up very quickly

386
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,639
because part of our qualification is

387
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,380
telling the hiring manager you need to

388
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,839
turn these around 48 hours we need full

389
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,360
feedback because that helps us change up

390
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,380
our search at that point typically we'll

391
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,779
see a telephone interview normally with

392
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,339
the hiring manager

393
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,220
some businesses will will put if it's if

394
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,540
we have not worked with them a lot of

395
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,800
times they tend to put a talent

396
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,300
acquisition person in to have a

397
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,220
conversation first

398
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,600
um but once we've established a

399
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
relationship with them usually the

400
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,480
hiring manager will just say right yes I

401
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,279
want to interview that person telephone

402
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,240
interview then typically a panel

403
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,300
um and then at the panel stage after

404
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,100
that sometimes it can be a direct

405
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,860
decision then sometimes it's like one

406
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,440
more interview with with perhaps hiring

407
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,420
other other directors or other people

408
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,300
higher up so that's a typical process

409
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,540
Kirsten so you've got culture fit you've

410
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,899
got technical ability you have a whole

411
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,480
variety of things and I didn't clarify

412
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,420
earlier Kirsten Works in Government

413
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,639
Contracting so there are a few extra

414
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,880
levels called security clearance

415
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,040
adjudication review and things like that

416
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,079
so my apologies for not making that

417
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,899
clearer earlier but go on I probably

418
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,339
should have as well

419
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,920
um so because because of that factor

420
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
there are some it's very similar to the

421
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,240
flow the funnel is is very similar so

422
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,000
we're gonna we're gonna schedule a call

423
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,980
initially with a recruiter this

424
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,740
screening call is where we build your

425
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,980
profile we uh we speak to you about what

426
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,500
am I looking for what I want to do next

427
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,480
so that we can make sure that we're

428
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,720
delivering to all the managers that

429
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,279
you're interested in talking to we get

430
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,079
an idea from you these are the types of

431
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,639
positions I'm looking for so we know who

432
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,800
to show you to we're not just going to

433
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,019
show you one position unless that's all

434
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,959
you want so the recruiter who reached

435
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,699
out to you probably reached out to you

436
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,619
because they had something in mind a

437
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,119
requirement on their desk that they're

438
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,579
responsible for and they'd explain it to

439
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,740
you and they say Hey listen I'm trying

440
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,179
to fill this full stack development

441
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,000
position it's in Springfield Virginia

442
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,839
and it requires a secret clearance and

443
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,760
you say I don't care about my clearance

444
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,679
anymore or I'm interested in upgrading

445
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,900
my clearance or I'm interested actually

446
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,520
into going into come up what you're

447
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,140
telling them and that's when it's up to

448
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,700
you right you're going to let them know

449
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,559
what you're looking for now they know

450
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,020
who to share your who to share your

451
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,900
information with so that they can

452
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
give you more opportunities that are

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
potentially a fit for you and as uh as I

454
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,900
was mentioned uh any clearance that is

455
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,120
required has to be verified that's

456
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,520
typically only takes a day or it should

457
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,340
only take a day I try to put slas on

458
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,860
managers that they have a day to respond

459
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,160
right that's that's my dream

460
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,260
um they have a day to respond and then

461
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,419
we have to you know as a team be

462
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,640
collaborative with each other and notice

463
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,820
for each other so the whole team my

464
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,980
whole team sees what each other is

465
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,080
submitting and in seeing what each other

466
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,640
is submitting they can poke each other

467
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
and go hey here's this other thing that

468
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,340
might work here's this other thing that

469
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,500
might work right because it's not it

470
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,960
isn't fair to expect every manager to

471
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,120
know every other manager's roles or

472
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,500
every recruiter to know every other

473
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,059
recruiter's role so if they're all

474
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,160
working together they can make sure that

475
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,039
no opportunity is missed so you're going

476
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,900
to have your quick screening call let's

477
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,460
just say all the managers do their job

478
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,280
and respond in a day I want you to be

479
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,700
interviewed at your earliest convenience

480
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,860
and I think a decision should be made

481
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,620
that day I think they should be able to

482
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,020
speak to you and figure it out if there

483
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,179
is a further requirement because of the

484
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,100
government customer or any or in any

485
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,780
situation even your commercial customers

486
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,880
if they want to meet you as well we'll

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
explore that to you up front we'll say

488
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,760
you know what there's one more phone

489
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,280
call you're going to have to do or maybe

490
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,580
you need to go on site and frankly maybe

491
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,080
you might want that you might say I'm

492
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
not ready to make this decision until I

493
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,059
see the office or meet some people so

494
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,360
so I hope you realize you we have two

495
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,460
extraordinary recruiters here but there

496
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,200
are sort of two little bits of

497
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,419
information pulling out of this one

498
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,700
whenever you're having that conversation

499
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,039
with any recruiter depending on if

500
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,600
they're a direct recruiter or Staffing

501
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,820
firm one question you should be asking

502
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
them is what is the process

503
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,559
when am I going to be meeting with

504
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
people what am I going to do a panel

505
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,980
interview am I going to do a phone

506
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,539
interview am I going to do a technical

507
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,820
interview do I get to meet the final

508
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,280
customer do I get to go on site do I get

509
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,980
to meet my team because this is part of

510
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,860
your job in the search the other thing

511
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,960
you should be pulling from this is you

512
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,580
should always be networking with a

513
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,039
recruiter this might not be you might

514
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,780
not find a job with Chris or Kirsten

515
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,559
this year but sometime down the road

516
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,120
you're going to want to talk to them

517
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,740
about a job you should be keeping up

518
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,600
with them cultivating that relationship

519
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,820
you should have at least five to eight

520
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,460
Recruiters in your network that you like

521
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,340
talking to that has given you honest

522
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,380
feedback that have helped you not

523
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,840
someone who has hounded you but someone

524
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
who has actually helped you in the

525
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,740
process because great recruiters like

526
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,559
these two network with other recruiters

527
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,620
and will say I can't find this person

528
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,380
for this position they'll network with

529
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,760
other recruiters and say I just

530
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,260
interviewed someone who would be

531
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,600
absolutely fabulous for that job great

532
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,580
recruiters network with other great

533
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,799
recruiters so always be having no

534
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,799
Recruiters in your network so the title

535
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,740
of this talk is Whose Line Is It Anyways

536
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,860
I remembered a comedy show years ago but

537
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,140
it's also something that comes up a lot

538
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,679
in when I talk to job Seekers they

539
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,679
always think that it's not their job to

540
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,820
do X or Y or Z in job search they think

541
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,100
that throwing a bunch of stuff on a

542
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,679
resume all of the recruiters are mind

543
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,360
readers and they're going to be able to

544
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,419
tell what you're trying to convey in

545
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,720
your resume so Chris what are some of

546
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,200
the good tips and not so good tips about

547
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
resumes what are some of the things that

548
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,520
you've seen and that you've cringed

549
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,260
about while you've done resume review

550
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,419
here so

551
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,299
um I will I shall start slightly before

552
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,900
the resumes if somebody posts a job or

553
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,380
something on uh on LinkedIn

554
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,380
don't just comment I'm interested that

555
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,539

556
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,000
never no contact no sending resume no

557
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,159
application and then you get a message

558
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,659
out the blue that said what what's

559
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,480
happening with that job okay all right

560
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,820

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,500

um but don't just post I'm interested so

567
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,400
that that's a little bug bear

568
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,460
um had to get off from my chest

569
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,960
you forgot to say in the process that

570
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,220
you have to apply yeah

571
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,650
[Music]

572
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,280
[Laughter]

573
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,550
yeah recruiting but not that good

574
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,880
[Laughter]

575
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,799
um so yeah so that's one part of it I

576
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,900
think when it comes to resumes

577
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,400
um my big

578
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,840
story is

579
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,900
you need to make sure your resume

580
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,400
represents the right set of experience

581
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,380
and skills for the job you're applying

582
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,220
for so uh you know I think keep your

583
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,900
resume really straightforward two or

584
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,179
three pages if you're hugely experienced

585
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,900
you might get away with four but really

586
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,659
anything that's 10 years plus experience

587
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,340
nobody's really interested in

588
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,280
um so that can be one line of just where

589
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,960
you worked and the dates or you might

590
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,580
even consider taking off if you're

591
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,440
worried about ageism certainly some

592
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,360
people remove stuff that's that's quite

593
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,220
a lot of years because people guess

594
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,600
people's ages and they worry about

595
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,320
ageism so I would say on a resume look

596
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,000
at it why did you keep looking at me

597
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
when you were saying that look at you

598
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,720
I've got a lot more gray hair than when

599
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,340
we then eight years ago when we did that

600
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,440
video right

601
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,440
um I think if you if you're looking at a

602
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,000
job description you should have that

603
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,880
next to you as you look at your resume

604
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,799
and if you've got relevant experience

605
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,659
just move just make sure it shows in

606
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,580
your resume and then apply for the job

607
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,919
so yes it will take you more time to

608
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,200
apply for jobs that way

609
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
looking for a job is a job in itself

610
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,120
like there's no there's no easy route

611
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,860
round you might get lucky and have a

612
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,419
friend turn around and say oh and will

613
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,860
you come and work for me that happens

614
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,480
but when you're looking for a job

615
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,860
earnestly and you're going through

616
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,740
recruiters make it easy for recruiters

617
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,659
to look at your resume and know straight

618
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,200
away yes this person's good because we

619
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,440
do get an awful lot of advert response

620
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
and an awful lot of applications and

621
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,299
probably 98 of them are not a good fit

622
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:09,659
so you want your application to stand

623
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,880
out and be very obvious that you are

624
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,260
worth taking to the next step

625
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,580
my dear

626
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,380
I was going to say if you remember

627
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,779
anything I said today the first thing

628
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,120
you should do on your resume is start

629
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,760
with not a dissertation not a story just

630
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,059
a I am of this and I would like to be a

631
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:30,900
vet

632
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,380
this that that's it don't assume that

633
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,960
that we know based on what you're doing

634
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
or based on what you listed what that

635
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,880
means your job is based on what you're

636
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,220
doing what you want to do next it's

637
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,679
going to help us drive this in the right

638
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,200
right direction just just let us know

639
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,840
right at the beginning one sentence I am

640
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
a systems engineer looking to become a

641
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,000
Solutions architect I am looking to get

642
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,559
into sales like if there's a different

643
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,720
direction you want to go in and and he'd

644
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,580
have shown a really important point and

645
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,700
that is that you should take a moment to

646
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,520
review what you're applying for and and

647
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,140
especially when you get when you get up

648
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,679
in years uh customized you know try to

649
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,320
to summarize and customize how your

650
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,059
resume looks based on the job that

651
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,520
you're applying for it is true that

652
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,880
nobody cares what I did in 1994.

653
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,679
um but they probably care what I did in

654
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,900
the last five years so that's a really

655
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,840
good point one of my biggest bugaboos on

656
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,480
on technical resumes because I did I

657
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,539
used to do a lot of resume review on

658
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,720
Discord was the infamous I want to make

659
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,960
it look pretty because I don't think my

660
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,480
experience is enough to get someone's

661
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,860
attention

662
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,700
content over pretty please you know no

663
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,299
Bolding no script no italics no scented

664
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,240
resumes you know none of that the other

665
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,520
thing that I that is a big Bugaboo for

666
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,919
me is a lot someone out there and

667
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,720
whoever it is I want to sit down and

668
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,100
have a drink with you and tell you how

669
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,740
wrong you are is

670
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,279
don't put a table or a graph in the

671
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,980
middle of your resume that says I have

672
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,659
all of these skills and all of these

673
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,539
certifications and everything one it is

674
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,919
really not going to go through the

675
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,080
applicant tracking system because you

676
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,240
don't know what the user interface is

677
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,919
for where your resume is going to be

678
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,039
reviewed and two everyone loves to put

679
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,559
as much in there as possible I have a

680
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,980
cissp and I'm really good at business I

681
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,980
have a Security Plus and I'm a creative

682
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,860
thinker no you put your certs in one

683
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,960
area you put your technical skills in

684
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
another and you know if you have

685
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,419
business skills show how you have

686
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,460
business skills don't just tell me you

687
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,100
have business skills I managed a budget

688
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,000
I had a team of ten I volunteered at

689
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,700
besides Las Vegas and I manage 20 people

690
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,600
and we built a knock have that in as

691
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
something that you have done not just

692
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,039
put it on there because you look talking

693
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,340
to fill up space I have business skills

694
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,480
so yes I'll also add columns to that I

695
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,580
don't like columns on a resume so I know

696
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,320
it's tempting to have I'm gonna have my

697
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,600
skills here my education down here and

698
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,159
then here's my experience don't do that

699
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,799
get an application uh ats's application

700
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,020
tracking systems don't really like those

701
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,779
things and as recruiters for external

702
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,000
recruiters I we put cover sheets on your

703
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,919
resume the moment we add a cover sheet

704
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,100
it loses all that formatting and and it

705
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,380
causes a complete mess so you don't I

706
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,020
would not do columns please yeah and

707
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,360
there are so many templates that are out

708
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,880
there that I can tell you I'd say ninety

709
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,820
percent of the resumes that I review

710
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,340
they've been you know force-fed into a

711
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,940
template that's really pretty simple

712
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,080
left to right top to bottom boring just

713
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,059
very boring because again you don't know

714
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,159
who's going to read it you don't know

715
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,020
what user interface is going to read it

716
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,480
so you want to make sure your content is

717
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,120
coming through so another thing that job

718
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,820
Seekers don't really think is their job

719
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,360
or as their line is preparation

720
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,299
Chris talk about preparing job search

721
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,220
preparing for interview preparing for

722
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,260
meeting with people what should people

723
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,720
be doing uh so yeah there's a lot of

724
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,159
stuff that you can do to to make sure

725
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,480
you're on top of it and just speak to

726
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,399
the recruiter first of all ask them

727
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,799
right what you know if this is a video

728
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,539
is this a telephone call is it a video

729
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,720
call how should I be prepared for it

730
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,399
what should I wear

731
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:43,799
um you know those kind of things you can

732
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,720
like we'll ask and find that information

733
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,580
out because we want you to put your best

734
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,399
foot forward straight away so ask us all

735
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,020
those questions anything you're not sure

736
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,539
of have a piece of paper and a pen or a

737
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,580
notepad or your phone open something

738
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,860
where you can take notes and because

739
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,480
that'll remind you to come back remind

740
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,520
you to ask questions have a few

741
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,159
questions prepared in advance there's

742
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:07,260
certain ones that I quite like which is

743
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,440
which are good for personal questions so

744
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,960
why did you join this company how long

745
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,820
have you worked here what makes you stay

746
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,080
here what do you think is the best thing

747
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,899
about working here get those feelings if

748
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,340
people can't answer that you might want

749
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,480
to consider whether you want to work

750
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,399
there

751
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,779
so there's some questions you can have

752
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,640
in advance that work really well and

753
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,679
show that you're genuinely interested in

754
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,480
the company as well

755
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,940
there are others that you might want to

756
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,799
jot down as the interview goes on so

757
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,779
that's why it's useful to to be prepared

758
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,659
and have your paper and stuff ready

759

points of things to prepare for and even

768
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,539
I there's quite a lot of the things I do

769
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,279
before I have meetings with my clients

770
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,779
right you know check the bandwidth make

771
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,179
sure I'm working might do a quick check

772
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,700
of the zoom calls and turn off all of my

773
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,200
other apps yeah all of those sort of

774
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,880
things so some really good stuff in

775
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,120
there

776
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:17,700
uh at one point that you made earlier

777
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,320
that I want to make sure people uh

778
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,899
didn't miss is that you were talking

779
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,419
about listing some of the volunteer

780
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:25,799
activities that you've done or anything

781
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,480
that you've done within the community

782
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,380
and how that translates into some of the

783
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,240
requirements within even if it wasn't

784
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,360
part of your job uh or if you're more

785
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,600
Junior in your experience level there's

786
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,919
a lot of uh business skills that uh that

787
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,220
you have to exercise here in the in

788
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,080
community events right so don't don't

789
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,899
lose track of how valuable that is as

790
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,100
well

791
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,840
um and then you you touched on my very

792
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,760
favorite part I always tell people when

793
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm coaching them going into an

794
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,820
interview you know to bring a notebook

795
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,320
and to write things down it shows that

796
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,640
you're interested in what they're saying

797
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,799
right when they're talking and then at

798
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,779
the end the thing that they always ask

799
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,220
well this this means the interview is

800
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,779
over when you hear do you have any

801
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,159
questions for us that means the

802
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,140
interview is over right you say you

803
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,659
crack your knuckles and then you say yes

804
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,820
and you make it about them exactly like

805
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,559
Chris said because people are

806
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,480
self-interested and and for a minute

807
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,159
they won't be the interviewer anymore

808
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,500
they'll be a human being telling you a

809
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,779
story about what it's like to work here

810
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,659
what is the best thing you learned in

811
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,179
the last year that's a really good

812
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,440
question

813
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,120
because if they haven't learned anything

814
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,340
how interesting is this place

815
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,380
right so just get them to tell you

816
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,480
exactly like what Chris was saying about

817
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,419
what it is like for them here what why

818
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,019
did you come here and is it is it still

819
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:50,519
true for you the thing that you thought

820
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,620
was gonna be interesting about this

821
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,620
place do you still feel that way have

822
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,539
you you know how have you grown here

823
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,279
that's going to tell you if that's a

824
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,840
good place for you based on what they're

825
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,340
telling you

826
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,140
can I I'm gonna add something to that

827
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,460
because as your speaker there's reminded

828
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,880
me we should write a book you're right

829
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,179
um so also one of my favorite questions

830
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,659
to to ask and this is because we don't

831
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,399
always get the feedback that we really

832
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,039
need from hiring managers sometimes we

833
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,140
just get yeses and no's and and that's

834
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,720
it and it takes days sometimes to get a

835
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
bit more than that from them

836
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,740
um you won't always get the truth but

837
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,019
you can ask the question so I always

838
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:33,960
like to to con encourage people to and

839
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,700
it can feel a bit awkward but you know

840
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,559
how did you think I did in this

841
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,120
interview what do you think I could

842
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,799
improve

843
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,980
um how do you feel that I would be a fit

844
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,019
you know just open questions like that

845
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:48,419
that they might say well I'll I'll think

846
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,740
about and come back to you or I've got

847
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,120
another three people to interview and

848
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,620
then I'll tell you yeah they might avoid

849
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,600
it but they may well just give you some

850
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,940
some things to say and what you might

851
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,799
even find is you might find something

852
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,559
comes out and you haven't discussed it

853
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,000
in the interview and it's not in your

854
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,220
resume but you have the experience so it

855
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,539
might be oh this might be a challenge

856
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,640
for you and it might just be your

857
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,620
opportunity to say oh wow I realized we

858
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,539
never covered that I actually did that

859
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,559
here

860
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,840
so you know there's always an

861
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,519
opportunity there you might might miss

862
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,899
out on something that would stop you

863
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:19,980
getting the job and you might actually

864
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,380
find out about it and manage to to get

865
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,779
in there before before that happens

866
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,760
an excellent point and don't be afraid

867
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,580
to tell the recruiter afterwards they

868
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,820
should be

869
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,820
because trust me they're going to let

870
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,279
the managers know if the if the person

871
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,919
felt uncomfortable or you know so that

872
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,960
they can they can use that to to do a

873
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,340
better job as well

874
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,559
so two points I just want to summarize

875
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,840
on what they were saying is realize that

876
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,179
if you do volunteer in the community if

877
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,080
you volunteer at a con if you volunteer

878
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,059
on a meet-up if you do your own uh

879
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,860
what is it at home you're on not Beowulf

880
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,880
bolstery your own lab if you have your

881
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,679
own lab sorry it's been a long two days

882
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,399
so anything you do extracurricularly is

883
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,619
that a word it sounded right it sounds

884
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,619
right yeah sure that you're weaving that

885
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,820
in to your resume and if you can find a

886
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,159
place to weave it into the resume be

887
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,899
sure that you're taking notes so that

888
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,179
you can answer that in the interview

889
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,760
because a lot of times you may have

890
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,280
learned something in your volunteer

891
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,918
community work you know like you made a

892
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:37,379
mistake and you learned something and

893
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,300
you became better for that you don't

894
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,639
really want to say you made a mistake at

895
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,099
your work you know because they're like

896
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,159
you don't want to do that and also

897
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,899
realize that you need to do the

898
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,760
preparation to find out what the company

899
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,760
does how they make their money how they

900
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,280
operate I can tell you I went into an

901
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,680
interview really excited about this

902
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,260
interview and the company was named

903
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,720
Kaiser and I thought it was Kaiser

904
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,480
Permanente and I went in to talk about

905
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
you know health care and all these great

906
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,380
things I was going to do in customer

907
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,960
service and sales and stuff and the guy

908
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,460
just sat there and stared at me and said

909
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,720
said

910
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,000

he was done you know we we both just

912
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,220
sort of stared at each other like okay

913
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,700
there's no conversation here to have

914
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,740
um I was embarrassed someone had

915
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,260

favorite favorite thing

918

so it's interesting job Seekers always

919
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,240
think it's the job of the recruiter to

920
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,760
do the follow-up it is

921
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,280
but Kirsten what should job Seekers be

922
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,320
doing

923
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,140

please don't assume that you've uh that

926
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,560
there's a certain period of time that

927
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,800
should go by uh they're gonna appreciate

928
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,660
the reminder they're going to appreciate

929
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,339
you the recruiter is going to appreciate

930
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,859
I certainly that was my biggest weakness

931
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:14,700
right it really really was me uh

932
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,000
intending to get back to everyone but

933
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,640
still a issue that I have uh but but

934
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,859
honestly it they appreciate the

935
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,260
reminders right and and go about it in

936
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,119
more than one way like if you haven't

937
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,460
made contact yet that's when you need to

938
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,619
probably be creative don't just think

939
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,800
the application is the only way

940
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
um you're gonna find that some people

941
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,339
LinkedIn is the best way some people a

942
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,140
lot of recruiters

943
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,119
um for me it's Twitter you know I have

944
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,680
people that are like well you never

945
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,460
responded to my application and I can't

946
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,960
you know you never responded to my email

947
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,119
they they were creative and they found

948
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,680
me on Twitter

949
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,320
um so don't be afraid to to keep

950
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,540

I think so I think so I think you should

954
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,000
especially if you get an interview uh

955
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
reach out ask the recruiter for the

956
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,300
hiring manager's information let them

957
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,560
know that you're thankful for the time

958
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,720
that they gave you

959
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,780
Chris what what follow-up yeah I was

960
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
going to say thank yous for sure I mean

961
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,980
nowadays A lot of these interviews are

962
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,339
over Zoom you have access to their email

963
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,619
addresses often when you see the invites

964
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,119
so you can send them a follow-up email

965
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,640
you know same day to say thank you very

966
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,260
much for your time I really enjoyed it

967
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm very interested in the role you

968
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,160
should certainly follow up with

969
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,980
recruiters you know we we have a whole

970
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,900
load of processes that hopefully mean

971
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,180
that we're chasing you very quickly to

972
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,920
try and get feedback so that then we

973
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,480
then can go and speak to the hiring

974
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,579
managers like our preference is to have

975
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,920
the candidate feedback first so that

976
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,140
when we speak to the hiring manager we

977
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,579
kind of have some idea what to expect

978
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,920
and also we might have already discussed

979
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,180
how we're going to deal with some of the

980
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,420
anything that can perhaps have come up

981
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,599
um so certainly chase us uh connect with

982
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,640
us even connect with the hiring managers

983
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,980
on LinkedIn as well and maybe when

984
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,480
sending them a connection saying oh

985
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
thanks I really uh appreciate your time

986
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,040
I would even say that you can do that

987
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,300
you know as soon as you've got the

988
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,160
invite you should be checking out their

989
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,560
LinkedIn hopefully you've worked hard to

990
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,180
make sure that your LinkedIn profile is

991
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,180
attractive and and is the same as what's

992
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,619
on the resume there's not too many

993
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:29,940
differences

994
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,500
um so I would even say that you could

995
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,300
connect with them say oh we've got a an

996
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,859
interview lined up for Tuesday I'm

997
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,240
looking forward to speaking to you so

998
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,880
connect with them beforehand uh so and

999
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,260
also you've done a bit of background

1000
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,000
there and you can do some background on

1001
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
the company and on the person to see

1002
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,300
their background as well

1003
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,940
so one thing that there's no it's never

1004
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,579
really talked about is whenever you see

1005
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,339
a job position opening or an advert

1006
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,740
there's nothing on there that tells you

1007
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,320
how best to connect with the recruiter

1008
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,859
it will tell you how to apply for the

1009
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,920
job but there is no place on the

1010
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,260
position that position opening that says

1011
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,079
to connect with the person who you will

1012
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,839
be talking to you will find them on

1013
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,000
Twitter you will find them on LinkedIn

1014
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,880
you will find them on Instagram you will

1015
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,400
find them on Facebook you will only be

1016
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,500
able to connect with them on email

1017
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,320
why I'm saying this is that you have to

1018
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,200
become proficient in all these various

1019
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,920
different ways of communicating because

1020
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,440
as Kirsten said you can connect with her

1021
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,180
on Twitter but if you don't have a

1022
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,980
Twitter account and you're trying to

1023
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,980
reach out to her on LinkedIn it's going

1024
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,440
to be a while versus I sent a message to

1025
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,119
Chris this morning on Twitter and he was

1026
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,220
like I never look at my Twitter I should

1027
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,160
have sent it on LinkedIn I knew that I

1028
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,099
didn't even follow my own rule so let's

1029
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,280
let's sort of delve into that deeper

1030
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,920
um and I run into this question a lot

1031
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,280
do you have separate emails and social

1032
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,740
media accounts personal versus

1033
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,619
professional I didn't know she was going

1034
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:10,619
to say that but I was about to say this

1035
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,359
might sound a little provocative or

1036
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,819
sensitive but if I'm actively looking

1037
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:18,540
for a job I am cultivating the things

1038
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,240
that are public that I am saying I'm not

1039
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,339
saying don't be who you are but keep in

1040
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,079
mind I'm also not saying that we're all

1041
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,859
stalkers okay however if you post every

1042
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,079
single day

1043
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,740
my boss is a jerk I hate it here I hate

1044
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,460
working but it's just even if they're

1045
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,119
not doing it consciously you it's just

1046
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,300
it's not very attractive appealing right

1047
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,520
professional

1048
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,920
something like that right and and but I

1049
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,420
mean there's different places where we

1050
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,579
should be able to voice you know be

1051
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,800
ourselves and be humans right but just

1052
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,980
just I just I think be careful

1053
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,140
um with with that so even if they don't

1054
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,579
even realize that if you're popping up

1055
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,760
in their feed every single day as the

1056
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,180
most miserable employee probably don't

1057
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,460
want to even talk to you right so just

1058
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,560
just cultivate that

1059
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,720
um and be cognizant of that particularly

1060
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,480
you know different spaces

1061
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,819
um are appropriate for for different

1062
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:23,640
types of content I think

1063
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,920
um like what what you're seeing on my

1064
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,140
Facebook is very different than you know

1065
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,420
what you're seeing in in other areas

1066
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,819
so I'm going to put Chris on the spot so

1067
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:35,040
if you don't connect if you're not

1068
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,079
connected with Chris yet you will be by

1069
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,060
the end of this session

1070
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,579
um realize that Chris spends an awful

1071
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,160
lot of time on LinkedIn asking a lot of

1072
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,619
provocative questions and really

1073
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,240
engaging so

1074
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
how do people stand out on LinkedIn when

1075
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,940
they're engaging with you because as you

1076
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,040
said you post a position and someone

1077
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,599
says I'm interested and then they ghost

1078
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,359
you so what would be sort of if if

1079
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,160
someone was going to connect with you on

1080
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,859
LinkedIn and then wanted to engage with

1081
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,079
you on not engage because you're married

1082
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,280
to a beautiful woman and have a

1083
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,460
beautiful daughter but

1084
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,579
how how would you talk about someone who

1085
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,740
wanted to be considered for one of your

1086
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,720
positions sort of wanted to stand out

1087
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,060
but didn't want to be a creepy stalker

1088
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,280
right this is the time I should say

1089
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,380
something I wear I met my wife on

1090
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,819
LinkedIn and that's how we go and get

1091
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,200
nice knot

1092
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,579
it was a different act though it wasn't

1093
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,560
dating app funnily enough

1094
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,319
um so I would say this like engage with

1095
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,819
my content

1096
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,579
um make genuine comments I I was

1097
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:39,960
speaking to somebody earlier on today

1098
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,020
and I kind of have a process that I

1099
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,240
think works really well and I I talked

1100
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,940
to my consultants and other people and

1101
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,040
and really encourage people to to do it

1102
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,980
I call it the one three ten rule

1103
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,380
um so made the effort to post one piece

1104
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,380
of content a day whether that's sharing

1105
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,180
something of somebody else's but make it

1106
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,760
genuine content make it authentic and

1107
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,160
make it professional

1108
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,339
um three is three comments on other

1109
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,920
people's content so not just yeah like

1110
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,339
that or yes agree you know actual valid

1111
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,960
genuine con yeah if you're interested

1112
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,040
and passionate about what they've

1113
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,020
written about explain why and actually

1114
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,099
put that on there because that's the

1115
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,480
stuff that stands out for anybody it's

1116
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,160
what stands out for me people have taken

1117
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,740
the time to to actually engage truly

1118
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,819
with it

1119
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,040
um and then the 10 part is look to

1120
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,740
connect with 10 people each day that are

1121
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,119
going to help you forward in whatever

1122
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,460
your goal is so if your goal is to get a

1123
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,560
new job connect with 10 people that

1124
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,680
would be the hiring managers in that job

1125
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,300
so that's just a process that I really

1126
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,000
like and and I think if you're genuine

1127
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,859
and authentic with the content you put

1128
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,079
and and the engagement that you do

1129
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,119
you're going to catch people's eyes so

1130
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,760
certainly I've I've you know established

1131
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,380
really good relationships over LinkedIn

1132
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,300
and have come to places like this and

1133
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,700
get to meet people that I've feel like I

1134
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,260
know really well but have never actually

1135
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,180
met so it's

1136
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,160
so do we have any questions in the

1137
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,460
audience

1138
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,859
oh come on yes sir

1139
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,040
hi uh so you've talked about LinkedIn a

1140
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,119
lot

1141
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,940
maybe I'm too old school but uh I

1142
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,619
remember LinkedIn when it was first

1143
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,140
growing it was baby F1 and still have

1144
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,700
the knee-jerk reaction that I hope it

1145
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,940
does five a thousand times

1146
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,640
your campaign

1147
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,800
how do you handle it so I'm going to

1148
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,420
repeat the question because we have our

1149
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,520
at-home audience and let me know if I

1150
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,160
got it right so how do you connect with

1151
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,619
candidates who don't who don't just are

1152
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,260
not comfortable being on LinkedIn or who

1153
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,960
are just not there so

1154
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,300
what do you say to a candidate who just

1155
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,980
doesn't want to be on social media

1156
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,140
doesn't want to be on LinkedIn I mean

1157
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,060
that's fine like we're not we're not at

1158
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,800
the stage where we're replacing resumes

1159
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,020
with LinkedIn yeah now that might happen

1160
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,460
or something similar to that might

1161
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,920
happen at some point but you don't need

1162
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,079
to be on LinkedIn you know there's pros

1163
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,300
and cons to it you know if you're not on

1164
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,220
LinkedIn it's hard to do that networking

1165
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,400
remotely and maybe get connected and

1166
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,200
build engagement with people that you're

1167
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,880
going to want to to try and better your

1168
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,160
chances of getting a job but likewise

1169
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,240
you're not also going to write something

1170
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,560
really silly that's going to stop you

1171
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,540
getting something as well

1172
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,760
um so you don't have to be on LinkedIn I

1173
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,440
think it's a major part of the job

1174
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,720
search now and I would encourage anybody

1175
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,720
that's thinking about it to to actually

1176
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,220
get on there because I think it would

1177
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,440
hugely help the opportunities increase

1178
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,720
the opportunities you've got I would say

1179
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,180
that they're starting to see other I

1180
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,740
used to love peer lists I don't know

1181
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,359
whether anybody new peer list but it was

1182
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,400
a you know social media site that was

1183
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,380
just really First Security and GRC

1184
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,900
people and fortunately

1185
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,359
um it was also needed to make a profit

1186
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,060
so it it was wasn't able to do that so

1187
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,500
it doesn't exist anymore but there are

1188
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,359
other other companies working on similar

1189
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,280
things the cloud security Alliance has

1190
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,700
got uh the circle platform so it's a

1191
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,500
there's a bit of a working process

1192
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,060
progress but there are places where

1193
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,740
security people can come together where

1194
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,960
it's kind of not all of the memes and

1195
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,280
some of the other

1196
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,960
rubbish that you have to deal with on

1197
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,579
LinkedIn sometimes

1198
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,980
so just real quick I love that you asked

1199
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,280
that question there's a there's a large

1200
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,800
chunk of the candidates that are

1201
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,180
qualified for the roles I'm looking for

1202
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,940
that aren't allowed to have a LinkedIn

1203
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,099
profile and then there's a whole other

1204
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,079
section that if they have a LinkedIn

1205
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,619
profile it just says Jane

1206
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,440
works at a company like that's literally

1207
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,380
it so um obviously there has to be other

1208
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,480
ways right so that's when we have to be

1209
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,280
creative and and that's when I would say

1210
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,740
to anyone who isn't advertising

1211
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,079
themselves in that way to go the extra

1212
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,420
step for us so that we can find you so

1213
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,579
that we can discover you

1214
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,560
um by either researching the company it

1215
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,240
doesn't mean you can't go on LinkedIn by

1216
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,339
the way right you say let's say you

1217
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,780
don't have a LinkedIn account you don't

1218
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,940
want one that's cool you can still go on

1219
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,700
it you can still look at the company all

1220
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,960
the companies that you're interested in

1221
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,180
they probably have a LinkedIn page and

1222
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,339
then you go to people see who the

1223
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,119
recruiters are or see who the managers

1224
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,400
are in the areas that you're interested

1225
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,619
in being in right the Departments that

1226
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:23,819
look like they're interesting to you

1227
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,980
who's in a management role send them a

1228
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,619
direct message right without a LinkedIn

1229
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:29,819
account you probably have to like pay

1230
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,980
money or something I don't know or get

1231
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,440
get a get a free account temporary one

1232
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,400
and just message them they'll respond

1233
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,960
and and realize that you could do a

1234
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,420
Boolean search through Google and most

1235
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,040
of it will bring up if you're looking

1236
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,380
I'm looking for Recruiters in cyber

1237

security who work at this company and in

1238
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,460
the Google search results you're going

1239
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,319
to get most of that profile but you can

1240
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,540
do the preview and get their contact

1241
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,319
information so you can still use it as a

1242
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,020
directory without having an account

1243
