1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,399
so i'm gabriel bassett i am not

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,200
dichotomy i am a pale comparison he is

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,520
the one who normally re leads prose

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,360
versus joe's and has done an amazing job

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,759
putting together an amazing team

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,240
to assist amazing people

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
um if you don't know pros versus joe's

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,440
is

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
unlike your stereotypical ctf

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
um we have live ranges we have live blue

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
teams evening live systems and being

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
attacked by live red teams

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,519
and

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
it really is an impressive thing to see

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
the teams mature to learn

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,520
and to see the camaraderie particularly

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
provided by all the teams

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,399
and so

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,320
my opportunity up here is to thank all

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
those people who make it happen

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
starting with the blue team players who

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
are willing to come in to practice for

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
weeks ahead of time

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
to play through the highs and the lows

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,320
they make the game and they make it

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,680
great

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
also i want to thank their captains who

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
are professionals who are patient with

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
them are kind are understanding and help

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
everyone learn

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,319
we also have a red team who

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,639
by all accounts could go in and just

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
attack only

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
and instead our red team sees this as a

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,600
educational opportunity to help the

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
blues learn

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,759
and they really do act not as so much as

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
an aggressor but as part of the staff

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
and then of course the gold team

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
i'm here we had two or three people i

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
especially want to thank

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
lauren rogers who stepped in at the last

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
minute because we're a little short

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
staffed

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
but we also had a half dozen gold team

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
members from all over the us dialing in

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
watching systems and running it

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
all in all it's a huge effort by a lot

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,360
of people but it touches a lot of lives

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,119
being my first time running it was also

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
my first time to experience sitting at

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,799
the front desk

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,280
and having

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
maybe every hour to someone come up and

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
say hey i was a player

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
last year or three years ago or five

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,159
years ago and it's the best

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
experience i've ever had i learned

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,160
things that i never learned anywhere

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
else

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
made a huge difference in my life

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,720
and

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
in that sense um ctf and prose versus

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
joe's is a

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
microcosm of the overall conference the

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
way besides las vegas touches so many

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,760
lives

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
and so with that it is all of us that

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,239
really deserve credit for all we do in

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,520
helping people

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,239
so i'll turn that back over

72
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,760
[Music]

to raise over 2k

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
this year over 35 items

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,760
some wonderful sponsors and lots of

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
drop-off items

98
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,959

[Applause]

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,680
next

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,040
cindy is going to share a few words

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
hey everyone um first of all

107
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
i'm gonna not cry because it's been a

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
really cool couple of days and i hope

109
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,919
everybody's gotten the same things out

110
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
of it that i have and just being able to

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
see our faces and

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
be here

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,919
because

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
it's been a different couple of years

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
man i've just been literally walking

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
around smiling you can't see it under

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,880
the mask but

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
just smiling for two days and it's

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
very rewarding so

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,639
i just want to share with everyone that

121
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,840
i mean that's where i'm sitting right

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,600
now from that chair knowing that we went

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
ahead and pulled off this event

124
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
in a little bit of a different way

125
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
um

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,199
very grateful for the ability to be here

127
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
we've gone all gone through some

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
craziness i'm sure we're not we're

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,520
dealing with and i hate saying the term

130
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
because it seems so cliche now the new

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,880
normal

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
um but we're working on getting back to

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,680
where we can establish our own normal

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
we do not have the numbers it was

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
probably evident this year

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
that we've had in the past

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
kind of planned it that way we kind of

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,360
wanted to ease in a little bit

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
i believe

140
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
i was told from a donor perspective we

141
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,280
had about 1600

142
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
badges the donations were made for so

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
that's pretty cool

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
that's not including our volunteers

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
our staff our speakers

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,759
their plus ones so there was a lot of

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
folks here um

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
i can't guess the number because people

149
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
flow in and out but i think we had a

150
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,759
pretty solid showing for the first year

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
back in person since 2019

152
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,240
um

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
like i said this past few years has been

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
like outside of any kind of threat model

155
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
any of us ever

156
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
or most of us i should say i think i had

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
somebody tell me that they actually did

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
a tabletop exercise with a threat model

159
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,720
representing this item was there

160
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
anything i had considered um

161
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,400
i was asking some of the staff

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
and some of the folks in the in you know

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,840
within the

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
common ground

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,240
what

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
or in a middle ground excuse me what

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
they thought

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
some of the good takeaways were from

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
this year and what they got out of it

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
and a lot of what i heard was just the

171
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
ability to be around the people again

172
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,639
and to talk about us in a common

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
language and to nerd out right that's

174
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
what we do we nerd out and we teach it

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
each other that's the whole goal of this

176
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
conference

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
there was a real significant number of

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,960
new faces even without the mask right we

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
had a lot of new folks and

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,319
this is not just people who are

181
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
attending and participating but people

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
who are volunteering they've never been

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
to besides las vegas yet they were still

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,039
volunteering that to me is so amazing

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,319
that means regardless of what's been

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,440
happening in the world they're still the

187
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
world's words still getting out and how

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
feel warm at heart

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
um

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
as we move forward we want to be a

205
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,560
little bit bigger than we were this year

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
a little bit closer to where we are in

207
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
2019

208
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,919
maybe we'll hit that

209
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
the reality is is that we're going to be

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
back here at the tuscany we're going to

211
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
be home

212
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
this is where we belong

213
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,639
i drove up

214
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
on

215
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,039
saturday

216
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
and i went to valet my car

217
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
and they asked me for my name

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
i said last name's jones

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080
oh you must be cindy

220
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
i thought it was because they had been

221
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,680
notified on who was showing up early it

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
wasn't it hadn't happened yet this guy

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
just remembered me from 2019 or the last

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
time i validate a car that to me is

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
mind-blowing i mean this is crazy so

226
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,160

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,760
one thing i have to say is our staff

254
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
all of our staff

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
are just amazing they work throughout

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
the year

257
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
when we made finally made the call that

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
we were going to move forward and the

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
board had a vote and said yes let's do

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
this event i think we all really kind of

261
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
wanted to i think a lot of us kind of

262
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,880
needed to

263
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
and it helped put us in a position of

264
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,600
feeling

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,920
back to our own normal right

266
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
um

267
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
the staff rallied so hard i mean we just

268
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
got things done a little bit different

269
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
new gaps

270
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
uh we got some areas where we're going

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
to go ahead and improve but every single

272
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
person on staff has been

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
just amazing

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,920

different folks who just couldn't make

346
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,680
it for whatever reason and they were

347
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920

so thanks guys i hope you're watching

349
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
this

350
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
okay

351
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,320
now's the hard one

352
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
um the last person i want to mention is

353
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
jack

354
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,990
[Laughter]

355
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
so he's why we're here right

356
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,399
he's one of he's the ultimate

357
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,120
grandfather of the b-side's events

358
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
um

359
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
he's the reason that most besides events

360
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,320
happen

361
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
really his he's an inspiration

362
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
he is a motivator

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,519
and

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
he wasn't here because it's a family

365
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
obligation

366
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,800
regardless he's always been supportive

367
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,320
he's always been

368
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
he's been jacked

369
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,720
i mean he's here always with us in his

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
heart i know that and he's definitely

371
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,760
here he's present this is jack you know

372
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
i mean

373
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
we still honor him just about every year

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
and i don't think that should ever stop

375
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,120
but that

376
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,839
so jack if you see this just know that

377
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
you are very loved and you are very

378
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
missed

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
and we hope to see you soon

380
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,480
all right last thing i want to say if

381
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
anybody in this room or anybody watching

382
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,839
the stream has any comments

383
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
or criticisms or suggestions for way of

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
doing things better different new ideas

385
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
we would love to hear that

386
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
we may not be able to expand by our

387
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
numbers but we always want to improve

388
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
quality right so one of the things we'd

389
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,760
love for you to do if you have any

390
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
comments we don't do formal surveys

391
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,279
honestly it's got an overhead we just

392
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,120
can't maintain but we can look at our

393
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,079
emails

394
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
