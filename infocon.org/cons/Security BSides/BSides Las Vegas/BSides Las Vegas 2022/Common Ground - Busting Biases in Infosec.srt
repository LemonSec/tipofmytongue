1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,340
all right everybody thank you for coming

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,680
uh if we can get the door closed thank

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,140
you for a wonderful besides thank you

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,800
for being here for our very last talk uh

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,840
we have an awesome talk on busting

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,299
biases in infosec

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,160
um

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,779
everybody's probably heard my spiel

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,340
about please keep your cell phones off

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,900
please don't record things because we're

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,180
recording it for you uh if you have

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,019
questions at the end try to speak up

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,060
you'll repeat them if not you can always

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,679
come up to the mic

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,719
I'm gonna get out of your hair and out

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,280
of your way so we can hear this talk

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,150
who

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,620
[Music]

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,360
pronoun I or You

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,820
just don't raise your hands

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,860
that was good I didn't expect that well

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,260
what's really funny is that I said you

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,780
at that point and there were multiple

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,059
people who Rose their hands all of you

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,100
identified as part of that you even

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,960
though I was talking to a group

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,479
isn't that interesting

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,000
but if I say who answers to the pronoun

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,340
I are you the rest of you

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,840
your brains just went they're not

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,520
talking about me now

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,320
he's talking about that person this

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,299
gentleman here said

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,500
well he's not talking about the rest of

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,720
everyone he's talking about me

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,759
there was a part in your brain that

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,220
clicked on and off without you having to

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,579
analyze what I was saying think about it

39
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,960
there was something in your brain that

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
just clicked and said that's me

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,259
what was that you see over the course of

42
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,520
Millennia and hundreds of Millennia that

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,560
we've existed as a species but as far as

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,180
brains have existed throughout millions

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,500
of years

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,200
Evolution has essentially crafted our

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,140
brains to develop patterns

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,479
and these patterns have done all kinds

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,040
of things for us mostly around survival

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
right if your brain doesn't develop a

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,500
pattern to identify the rustling trees

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,719
and the rustling bushes as possibly

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,299
dangerous there may be a bear or tiger

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,439
or something back they're going to eat

55
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,119
me I need to get out of here

56
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,860
you probably didn't survive long enough

57
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,800
to pass on your genes and therefore your

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
brain functions

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,580
the people who did develop patterns and

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,379
the animals that did develop patterns to

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,560
react and to be able to form those Split

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,879
Second they're not thinking about it

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,680
it's just the Instinct that gut feeling

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,920
those are the ones that survived

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,680
and so these brain patterns exist

66
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,180
and these brain patterns persist even

67
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,459
today and even walking in and sitting

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,620
down I've already shown how you've

69
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,239
already made a couple little assumptions

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,200
there

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,940
but even walking around you've already

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,040
seen by by

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
um processing sensory input about what's

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,540
going on up here with me

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
you've already made assumptions you may

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
not realize it for instance you may

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,580
think

78
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,459
that I can see you right now I can kind

79
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,140
of see these people up here I can't see

80
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,239
really the rest of you you're a blur and

81
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,440
it would really help if I wore my

82
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,760
glasses

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,739
these aren't my glasses

84
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,260
these are some empty frames

85
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
now how many of you thought those were

86
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,920
my real glasses

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,739
there may have been a few of you

88
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,080
you didn't think about that you didn't

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,959
go oh glasses and you know yeah you can

90
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,000
probably see with those your brain

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,180
matched a pattern made an assumption did

92
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,800
not arise in your Consciousness to see

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,019
that but now when I did that just now

94
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,120
put my fingers through the frames and

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,340
revealed that

96
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,860
for those that didn't know

97
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200
it probably twinged you a bit like oh

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,760
wow I got tricked just a little bit it's

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,040
not a huge trick but it's a little trick

100
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,860
courtesy of uh the great James Randy

101
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,860
but you probably had a little bit of wow

102
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,299
something happened there

103
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,340
that's something happening there is your

104
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
brain going wow my pattern didn't work

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,140
I need to develop a new one and so now

106
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,120
your brain's already saying we need just

107
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,980
like a just like a Sim rule a Sim alert

108
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
you're already starting to slightly

109
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,459
adjust your pattern maybe I should see

110
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,959
if there's some kind of reflection in

111
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
the lenses before I just assume someone

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,580
has glasses on or maybe your brain just

113
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,019
goes what you know what this was a weird

114
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,540
one-off situation and I don't need to

115
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540
develop a pattern for that whatever

116
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,519
but your brain is Raising alarms now the

117
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,019
question is

118
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,298
is you didn't do a thing about that

119
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,279
you didn't decide for any of those

120
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,720
things to happen to you they happen to

121
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,600
you so the real question is

122
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,220
is what choice did you really have over

123
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,900
any of that

124
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,600
thanks for coming to the stock my name

125
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,180
is odd job and

126
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,460
um I am a co-founder board member and

127
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,979
CEO of circle citycon and I've been

128
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,919
hacking for 10 years in fact it's really

129
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,960
interesting my first Defcon was Defcon

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,560
20.

131
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
[Music]

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,820
um so that's been really fun to be able

133
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,000
to speak at b-sides lv's Ninth year so

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
I'm very happy to have that

135
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,440
um I also work for Fortune 500 as a

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,500
cyber resiliency director and just a

137
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,660
fair warning I am not a psychologist I

138
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,180
am not a neurologist I've just learned

139
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,680
from some of them

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,800
but I am no way trained oh

141
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,080
I am being approached I need an adult

142
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,699
I am an evil fairy

143
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,220
I believe you requested oh my goodness

144
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,680
it is perhaps possible that I did

145
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,919
actually I forgot I requested this uh

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,599
oh wow

147
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
all right well you're gonna get malort

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
face through this whole talk

149
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,739
that's true

150
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,900
it keeps going too like ah like you know

151
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,360
how like a wine kind of develops

152
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,539
that just kind of yeah

153
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,940
it's glorious

154
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,860
and there are also may be some advice

155
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,500
that I give that might be considered

156
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,780
somewhat of a legal nature but I'm not a

157
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,220
lawyer and I'm not giving legal advice

158
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,720
go talk to your lawyers about some stuff

159
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,940
that you may find legally I don't know

160
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,160
suggestive later

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,539
uh so here's what we're going to talk

162
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,680
about we're going to talk about base

163
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,539
assumptions about our brains because

164
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,100
that's where our base assumptions come

165
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,539
from right

166
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,380
um and then we're going to talk about

167
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,479
some biases and fallacies and what those

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,699
are functionally within our brains what

169
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:21,780
those are

170
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,180
we're going to talk about how bias uh

171
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,660
arises in infosex so how do we see uh

172
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,759
biases in our everyday lives including

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,979
in our jobs uh especially when we're

174
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,900
trying to convince people to maybe do

175
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,880
certain things or not do certain things

176
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,979
we may have to help them overcome their

177
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,440
bias and we need to overcome our own on

178
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
various levels and then we're going to

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,860
talk a little bit about things you can

180
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,720
do to help mitigate or kind of start on

181
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,060
a path to notice and mitigate your own

182
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,919
biases and there's some junk down it

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,960
there at the bottom of this uh slide

184
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,199
don't know where that came from but

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,479
so let's get so let's get back to this

186
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,160
because we didn't we didn't answer that

187
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,419
question did we

188
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,919
who answers the pronoun I or You

189
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,500
well again it's all about brain patterns

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,259
and the real question is

191
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,780
what are you yeah you're the meat suit

192
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,440
but like what are you so what is

193
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,199
generating the units that sounds like

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,000
woo but we're gonna get into

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,099
Consciousness here so I want you to take

196
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,620
a moment to hold something in your hand

197
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,099
could be your badge could be a can of

198
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,199
something and I want you to feel like

199
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,039
there's there's some texture maybe there

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,220
maybe there's a corner don't if it's a

201
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,440
Coke can don't like cut yourself on any

202
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,300
of the thin metal

203
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,639
um but yeah just kind of carefully and

204
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,139
and think about that you know notice

205
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,360
what's happening now it's interesting

206
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,919
because the sensations you're receiving

207
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,800
obviously are the touch but the quality

208
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
of those Sensations that are going on in

209
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,680
your brain right now you have no control

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,180
over those are things your brain are

211
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,280
just doing for you it's popping up in

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,660
Consciousness everything you're noticing

213
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,759
about your badge by the way you now have

214
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,319
a better understanding and feeling for

215
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,960
your badge than you probably did five

216
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,819
seconds ago

217
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,419
um

218
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,580
none of that is your decision you're not

219
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,139
making any decisions about what's going

220
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,819
on right now with how you're thinking

221
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,500
and the way your brain is right now

222
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,840
formulating what it thinks and what it's

223
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,039
doing with this so this is very

224
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,440
important to kind of understand

225
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,580
um

226
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,340
so the other question I want to ask is

227
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,620
um

228
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,659
essentially

229
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,219
make sure I have a on the right slide

230
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,958
there okay so the other question I want

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,099
to ask you

232
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,740
is I want you to think

233
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,779
of a song

234
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,820
that you like

235
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,980
now you notice I put some patterns in

236
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,500
there or some pauses in there one of the

237
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,240
most interesting pauses was between song

238
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,580
and you like

239
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
how many of you when I said song

240
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,399
immediately thought of some kind of song

241
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,779
the song you liked

242
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,700
okay someone said no that's interesting

243
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,260
because your brain actually does like to

244
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,880
remember negative experiences more than

245
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,519
positive but if you've listened to that

246
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,080
song loads and loads and loads of time

247
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,180
that pattern may override the negative

248
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
pattern so that's interesting but the

249
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,720
point I'm getting at

250
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
you didn't choose what song popped into

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,800
your head you didn't go well the library

252
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
of music that I'm aware of in my Napster

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,880
down I mean my Apple downloads

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,279
that's the song I want to choose your

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,140
brain said

256
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,700
Dua LIPA

257
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,279
right something I got that was it okay

258
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,140
awesome I'm a mentalist

259
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,420
so but you've got that you did not

260
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,600
choose to select that song of any choice

261
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
we could possibly think we really make

262
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,380
in life that should be a choice we think

263
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,000
we should be able to make because it's

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,459
completely within us it has nothing to

265
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,620
do we think with the outside world but

266
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,720
but let me ask you another question how

267
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,399
many of you think if we were to go back

268
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,980
just however long it takes to go back to

269
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,320
the time before I ask that question

270
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
and you know nothing about what has

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,800
happened over the last 30 seconds

272
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,300
how many think you would have chosen a

273
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,660
different song

274
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,940
neurology tells us you wouldn't your

275
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,500
brain state would be in the exact same

276
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,380
space as when I asked that question

277
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,600
and because it was and the circumstances

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,180
are the same given everything's equal

279
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,800
you would come up with the exact same

280
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,760
thing

281
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,560
now if I were to ask it you'd come up

282
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,380
with a load of other things but again

283
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,519
you're now in a different brain State

284
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,040
okay okay okay so what control do we

285
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,760
really have over our minds then

286
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,579
we don't know we actually don't know

287
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,440
this this is something that's very

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,300
misunder not misunderstood but there's

289
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,700
just not a lack of knowledge in there

290
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,540
um

291
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,459
a lot of the things that we have just

292
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,040
I've just triggered you in you to think

293
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,060
about

294
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,100
don't lie at the high level of

295
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,600
consciousness

296
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,279
because you could review your choice and

297
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,959
be like I think I actually really like

298
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
this song More

299
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,839
you could do that and to that level

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,180
maybe you have a choice but at gut

301
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,260
instinct

302
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,320
you did not have that choice so really

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,079
what I want to now talk about are biases

304
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,600
because biases live in that world that

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,640
we just dove into in your mind

306
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,200
it's that part that you don't really

307
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,959
have a control over especially the

308
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,540
implicit bias portion so let me let me

309
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,880
help you understand this so biases are a

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,260
prejudice

311
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,920
in favor of or against something people

312
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,180
objects ideas

313
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,120
and explicit bias is something that you

314
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,380
would admit it's it's something

315
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,899
self-reported it's essentially a belief

316
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,920
you hold

317
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,500
for instance a very common well I won't

318
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,300
say common but probably commonly known

319
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,740
by us

320
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,660
um you know someone might say well I

321
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,000
believe men and women are equal

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,459
but women are built differently and

323
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,600
their minds work differently so

324
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,459
therefore they're not suited for certain

325
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,320
positions

326
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,420
and you know what men aren't really

327
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,860
people people

328
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,360
they're not suited for that they're

329
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,160
analytical so they really shouldn't stay

330
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,899
at home and do any of that kind of work

331
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,300
because they're mad they're just built

332
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,920
differently we're equal but we're just

333
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,839
built differently that bias is an

334
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,260
explicit bias it is self-reported

335
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,940
implicit bias

336
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,399
is not something you would even know to

337
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,139
admit to it's not a belief you maybe

338
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,940
even know you have

339
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,279
an implicit bias

340
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,920
though does affect your decision making

341
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,959
because it's in that unconscious part of

342
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,720
the brain that we just went into

343
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,040
and it's something that you don't

344
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
necessarily become aware of until

345
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
someone kind of does something like this

346
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,320
to make you aware of where this is

347
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,639
um which actually is funny because

348
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,220
there's some uh HTTP not found so maybe

349
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,139
there's something fun there

350
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,139
um so an idea of an implicit bias for

351
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,940
instance so there was a name there were

352
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,220
some name studies that have been done a

353
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,540
very interesting name study that was

354
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,519
done uh is

355
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
um I forget which institution did this

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
but they essentially submitted loads of

357
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
applications to

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,980
um job postings and essentially what

359
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,920
they did is they had job postings and

360
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,200
they had applications and they had some

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,180
male sounding names they had some female

362
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,279
sounding names they had some culturally

363
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,980
white European sounding names they had

364
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,019
some culturally black sounding names

365
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,540
some uh you know Latino sounding names

366
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,399
Asian sounding names and I know that's

367
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,500
an entire continent so there's all kinds

368
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,480
of different names that can go there but

369
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
they did this they sent this to people

370
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,320
but then you know what else they did

371
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
they took some of the same resumes and

372
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,380
just switched the names

373
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,579
and they were judged differently

374
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,719
just because of the name

375
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,560
they didn't go

376
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,820
oh

377
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,360
well that has to be you know this person

378
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,160
so I'm not going to do that they may not

379
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,380
have had that going on in their brain

380
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,480
at the top level but at the bottom level

381
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,399
there was something about the name that

382
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,199
biased them

383
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,600
at the implicit level

384
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,880
against that resume and cause them to

385
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,860
downscore that now it's not like there's

386
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,740
a 50 difference in scoring but it still

387
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,300
is significant enough to where you won't

388
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,040
get a callback in fact I remember as an

389
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,839
anecdote there was someone who was

390
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,399
trying to apply to Target

391
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,959
and she's black

392
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,779
she changed her name to a male and a

393
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,160
white sounding name

394
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,959
and sure enough gotta call back

395
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,639
immediately

396
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,440
that's an anecdote plural anecdote is

397
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,260
not data but definitely the singular

398
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,079
anecdote is not data either but that's

399
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
just another illustration further of

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
this phenomena that we have this

401
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,260
implicit bias and by the way this wasn't

402
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,000
just men that were reviewing the resumes

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
this was also women

404
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
so this is something that we all

405
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,300
actually can have within us

406
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,800
something else I want to talk about is

407
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,720
fallacies and in order to understand

408
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,459
fallacies just a little bit there's two

409
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,500
things that you need to understand about

410
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,360
reasoning

411
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,300
this is a syllogism it's a way of

412
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,160
essentially arguing and laying out an

413
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,720
argument to where you can say by the

414
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,240
time the conclusion is cited that yes

415
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,760
this is true so let's look at this

416
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,579
premise one all humans are mortal

417
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,880
premise two odd job as a human

418
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,399
conclusion odd job is Mortal okay

419
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,620
there's two things that have to be there

420
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,880
there's two things that have to be

421
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,620
correct in order for this to not only be

422
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,240
a true conclusion but a reasonable

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,380
conclusion

424
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,360
first of all the premises have to be

425
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
true now we could go and talk about

426
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,660
whether there are any Immortal humans

427
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,399
walking amongst us if any of you are 25

428
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,620
and are actually 25 000 please let me

429
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,839
know we want to run tests on you and

430
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,120
keep you in a lab in area 51.

431
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,540
um but if uh we do know there are

432
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,060
Immortal beings on this Earth there's

433
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,880
like little microscopic Hydra that

434
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,800
literally don't age and don't die their

435
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,980
cells reproduce perfectly every time

436
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,279
uh Jellyfish are Immortal they don't die

437
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,320
they just die when a sea turtle eats

438
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
them for spaghetti you know that's what

439
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,500
I was watching a video that the other

440
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,600
day I said this is beautiful oh wow this

441
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,339
is actually horrifying

442
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,980
depending on the perspective

443
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,620
um so so yeah so the premises look like

444
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,720
they're true great but not only that it

445
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
has to follow now what do I mean by

446
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,279
follow well we could also say odd job is

447
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,079
Mortal which we all agreed upon in the

448
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,420
last syllogism we could say all humans

449
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,220
are mortal which again we agreed the

450
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,259
premise of the last one but can we say

451
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,660
odd job as a human because of the first

452
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,980
two premises

453
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,620
well I could be a dog and still be

454
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,100
immortal

455
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,360
right so it does not follow just because

456
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,060
our job is Immortal and just because all

457
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,220
humans are mortal it doesn't therefore

458
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,740
follow that odd job as human even if the

459
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,380
premises are true

460
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,820
so there's those two different things

461
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,079
about logic that you gotta understand

462
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,079
here fallacious reasoning

463
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,360
happens also at that base level that

464
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,220
bias level that implicit level of the

465
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,920
brain to a degree kind of hops up a

466
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,540
little bit between implicit and explicit

467
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,339
bias

468
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,660
um

469
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,059
but essentially

470
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,980
they those things really mess with your

471
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,359
day-to-day especially if you deal with

472
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,880
data a lot because coming to conclusions

473
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,520
is a very important thing and not

474
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,900
everyone develops everything into

475
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,640
syllogistic form in order to do that you

476
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,199
can't you can't live life that way you

477
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,179
can't live life in a syllogism

478
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,919
but I want to talk about some biases now

479
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,000
because that's why we all came here

480
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,799
right we came here to learn about biases

481
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,000
we've learned a little about the human

482
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,220
brain learned about how we have these

483
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,799
vulnerabilities biases some fallacies

484
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,660
some fallacious reason that's built in

485
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,820
that's hardwired I want to see the

486
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,260
software bill of materials for our

487
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
brains because uh we got some

488
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,100
dependencies that are rotten

489
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,140
um I'm sure a few people have probably

490
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,600
seen this image okay this is a World War

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,900
II study that was done during the war

492
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,240
um essentially these are bombers that

493
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,820
came back from their missions and

494
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,740
essentially the Allies wanted to take a

495
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,980
look and see hey do we need to beef up

496
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,260
armor on our bombers

497
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,179
so they took data points each one of

498
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,340
those bullet holes represents a bullet

499
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,280
hole and location on a bomber that came

500
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
back in this study

501
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
and what ended up happening is they

502
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,799
mapped them onto just this image here to

503
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,720
show where the bullet holes are

504
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,059
and they asked the pool of experts where

505
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,620
do you think we should spend the time

506
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,840
effort money resources manufacturing

507
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
power beefing up the armor or something

508
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,000
with those locations and most of the

509
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,480
experts said well obviously the main

510
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,580
fuselage is getting hit the wing tips

511
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,200
are getting hit and way back there on

512
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,179
the tail Wing we're getting some hits so

513
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,400
probably want to focus in those areas

514
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,780
because they're getting hit a lot you

515
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,100
know bolts are going through so that's

516
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,960
not a good thing

517
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,559
another expert said

518
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,660
we need to take a look at everything

519
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,340
that doesn't have a bullet hole and

520
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,059
armor that up

521
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,460
because what's missing is not only the

522
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,960
bullet holes

523
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,880
but what's missing from the study is the

524
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
planes that didn't come back

525
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,380
and where do you think those bullet

526
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,640
holes might be if we would have been

527
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,980
able to measure them

528
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,480
this is what's known as survivorship

529
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,679
bias

530
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,600
where you're not considering the data

531
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
you don't have and what that might tell

532
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,880
you about what decision you should be

533
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,340
making so they went and armored up the

534
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,620
engine the cockpit area the back tail

535
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,360
fuselage and I think they even maybe did

536
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,520
some of the forward Wings more planes

537
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,140
came back

538
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,059
imagine that

539
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,740
and they had bullet holes in those areas

540
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,720
so there you go you know what works

541
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
hooray bullets or they didn't have holes

542
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,380
but they they saw they saw dents right

543
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,299
they saw they saw it was working so

544
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,660
hooray bullet holes so survivorship bias

545
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,360
does exist not just in this model

546
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,380
um but

547
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,360
essentially when we talk about

548
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,820
successful people for instance if you've

549
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,640
ever seen a slow media cycle uh during a

550
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,460
week you've probably seen like CNBC or

551
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,220
someone say oh hey uh here's nine

552
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,840
successful habits of successful people

553
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,700
and if you emulate these habits you're

554
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,919
going to be successful too sounds sounds

555
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:06,539
right sounds like it should follow right

556
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,299
odd job is Mortal humans are mortal

557
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,299
therefore odd job is human

558
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,480
wait so

559
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,400
what is happening there

560
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
is

561
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,880
those successful people are waking up at

562
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
like 4am they're doing exercise for an

563
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
hour every day they're reading a book

564
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,260
they're taking a half hour just to think

565
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,600
and you know what that's cool and that

566
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,159
may be good for you

567
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,500
but is that what made them successful

568
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,179
we're looking at the people who have

569
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,080
already survived and risen to the top or

570
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,799
sufficiently high to call them

571
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,360
successful whatever in this capitalist

572
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,179
world and we see that and we say great

573
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,580
we need to emulate that

574
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,320
but what we're missing are all the

575
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,539
people who emulated those exact same

576
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,059
factors and qualities and didn't make it

577
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,220
maybe those criteria

578
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,020
are not the criteria that we should be

579
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,299
making our decisions on maybe these

580
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,880
criteria are not the criteria we should

581
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,760
be making our decisions on about who to

582
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,220
hire who is successful and how do you

583
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,600
become successful

584
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,159
very similar

585
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,380
into how we write

586
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,780
um how we write our job descriptions do

587
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,539
we need 30 years of experience for an

588
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,760
architect

589
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,039
right no

590
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,539
no we don't because there's plenty of

591
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,460
people only have five or six maybe even

592
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,919
eight or who knows how many it's not

593
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,299
that's trivial that's not what you're

594
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,220
trying to get at you're trying to get it

595
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,620
what can they actually do

596
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,140
what do they actually know and some of

597
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,820
that's hard right and we're trying to

598
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,559
put things into a job description to try

599
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,419
and judge people on something we feel

600
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,640
like we can control and know but I've

601
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,380
met people who've had 30 years of

602
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,559
experience they don't really know much

603
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,600
and I've met people who have a couple

604
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,419
years under their belt oh my gosh like

605
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,520
they're they're brilliant and I've met

606
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,320
everybody in between right I think we

607
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,820
all have

608
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,860
we even go back to the the study that we

609
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,559
talked about the name study

610
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,720
um one of the things we can actually do

611
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,299
to limit Survivor bias especially in the

612
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,860
hiring process

613
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,240
is taking a look at removing things that

614
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,880
are not good or not good criteria in the

615
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,220
job description but when the intake

616
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,220
comes in removing things like names

617
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,500
because that triggers a bias

618
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,720
now we can't necessarily control that

619
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
bias or even be conscious of it all the

620
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,480
time

621
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,760
so a mitigation in that case is to

622
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
completely just remove it remove the

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,539
name you don't need it the name is

624
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,280
Trivial to knowing whether someone's

625
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,600
qualified right

626
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,240
what about college names if if you even

627
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,980
require a college degree but let's say

628
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,960
you don't and people still put that on

629
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,860
there you should be proud of your

630
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,659
college I think

631
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,460
but if you're kind of a person that says

632
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,559
well MIT that's fantastic well guess

633
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,020
what who goes to MIT

634
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,100
and what are you going to end up

635
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,500
selecting for probably people who are

636
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,440
white probably people who are male

637
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,580
CIS abled on and on and on we could go

638
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,900
you're leaving a historically black

639
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,280
colleges you're leaving out women's

640
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
colleges you're leaving out community

641
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,460
colleges where people who can't afford

642
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,220
to go to Harvard and MIT

643
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,559
they weren't in there but if we say am I

644
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,720
is the success level we're leaving out

645
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,120
everybody else that's killing us on our

646
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,400
survivorship bias there and we're losing

647
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,740
on a lot of candidates and I bet that

648
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,620
job Gap goes from this to this at least

649
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,780
if we just did those two things alone

650
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,299
and of course I always recommend uh

651
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,460
don't even interview people until you

652
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,220
know the pool of people in the resume

653
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,900
pile or diverse

654
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,760
you know if you have 100 applicants and

655
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,240
only 10 or non-cis white male you know

656
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,460
on and on and on

657
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,140
then you don't have probably a

658
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,880
sufficiently diversified candidate pool

659
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,580
go find more people Outreach do things

660
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,779
like that

661
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,640
you don't have to select specifically

662
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,860
for that but you have the pool that you

663
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,960
pull from and can review it's more

664
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
likely you're going to get a good sample

665
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,700
of people from the population which that

666
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,860
feeds into selection bias not a part of

667
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,419
this talk today

668
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,799
so

669
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,679
the other bias that I want to talk about

670
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
real quick is confirmation bias the

671
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
solution in search of a problem

672
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,580
and so or the conclusion in search of

673
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,740
evidence maybe so

674
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,539
um essentially confirmation bias is you

675
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,400
formed a conclusion for some reason it

676
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,779
could even be just a gut feeling you

677
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,400
have because you're an expert and you've

678
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,740
been in security for 15 years and you

679
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,659
just know when you see this it means

680
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,039
this and you're just going to run with

681
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,500
it but you know

682
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,080
you think this is a Dos attack and

683
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
you're gonna have to get some evidence

684
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,100
and so you go and look for the evidence

685
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,380
that confirms a Dos attack

686
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,679
and if you're going to do that what the

687
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,900
confirmation bias says happens

688
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,120
is if you have this bias you start

689
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,039
rejecting and we all do this honestly to

690
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,360
some degree or another

691
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
we started either ignoring data we see

692
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,340
that is contrary to our conclusion we

693
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,659
started out with

694
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,799
or we outright reject it we go no

695
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,419
and so we may have a little bit of

696
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,700
evidence that we might even go so far as

697
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,760
to stretch its validity towards the

698
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,080
conclusion

699
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,360
to say yeah no you're wrong mountain of

700
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,640
evidence I have this little grain of

701
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,340
evidence here and I'm good

702
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,260
um that's a confirmation bias going on

703
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,419
Google seeing all the studies that say

704
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,279
you're wrong and then finally that one

705
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,840
that says you're right and going like

706
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,059
there we go got what I came for

707
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,100
I actually had to fight against that for

708
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,419
this talk

709
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,779
I have confirmation bias and I had to

710
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,460
fight against that in fact I ripped art

711
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,039
even a part of this talk because I

712
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,740
thought I had a selection bias correct

713
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,120
and I didn't

714
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,039
and I actually searched a good while

715
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,559
looking for my thought

716
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,120
and everything kept coming up and I'm

717
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,440
like you know what I'm talking about

718
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,440
confirmation bias too

719
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,779
and uh this is a confirmation bias and

720
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,740
I'm actually going to call it out

721
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,299
because we do this all the time when we

722
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,740
research there's always that little

723
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,360
thing that says Nah don't pay attention

724
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,500
to that you already got what you came

725
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,020
for you really should and so what we

726
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,700
should do when we come up with

727
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,500
confirmation bias

728
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,380
is we should actively seek out

729
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,320
ideas conclusions that are the direct

730
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,580
opposite

731
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,159
of what we're talking about and try to

732
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,960
look for

733
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,480
how could I be wrong what would that

734
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,380
look like

735
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,600
test for that it's kind of like a threat

736
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,279
hunting you have your hypothesis you go

737
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,840
look for the bad action that matches

738
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,640
that hypothesis but before you drop to

739
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,840
the conclusion

740
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,340
you do it's kind of the scientific

741
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,380
method you do look for

742
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,200
other explanations you do look for other

743
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
things that describe this behavior

744
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,679
before going off and saying the world's

745
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,480
on fire

746
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,679
people aren't going to like you very

747
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,779
much if confirmation bias causes you a

748
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,140
false alarm

749
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,100
um there's the curse of knowledge bias

750
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,140
and I bet you everyone in this room has

751
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,179
the curse of knowledge bias in them so

752
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,559
this says there's a tendency for

753
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,299
well-informed individuals to find it

754
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,740
hard to think about problems from the

755
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,419
perspective of poorly formed individuals

756
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,320
I got it right I remembered it now

757
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,380
so MFA is actually I'm going to use this

758
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,960
twice but MFA is a really good example

759
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,159
of this so

760
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,260
uh multi-factor authentication we all

761
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,299
know why we should have multi-factor

762
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,620
authentication or at least we should

763
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,899
maybe varying degrees of us do we may

764
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,399
even know why we need certain types of

765
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,020
multi-factor Authentication

766
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,960
maybe SMS isn't good enough right

767
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,940
um so we have all that but when you're

768
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,039
talking about users

769
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,080
they're not stupid they're not informed

770
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,120
they don't know what you know they don't

771
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,419
know how bad you can really damage their

772
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,240
personal life their the company through

773
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,000
them and everything else they don't know

774
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,580
and so what they're saying is oh I have

775
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,740
a username I have a password and now I

776
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,419
got this thing on my phone

777
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,399
that I gotta do

778
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,860
just so I can do my job and that's the

779
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,179
way they see it

780
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,100
and this is a bias that's Troublesome

781
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,679
for us because when we're not thinking

782
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,080
about people who are especially not in

783
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,840
our own groups let alone just limited

784
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,460
knowledge

785
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,500
we're possibly pushing things that are

786
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,120
not necessarily harmful to people but

787
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,640
inconvenient and might also hurt our

788
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,919
ends which is adoption we want everyone

789
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,020
to adopt MFA

790
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,080
so instead of maybe pounding the hammer

791
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,779
maybe we bring not so well-informed

792
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,820
people into the discussion we learn from

793
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,860
them we talk with them because now we're

794
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,299
listening to things that don't already

795
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,000
support our well-informed perspective

796
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,320
and then we come to this middle point

797
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,799
where we go aha let's deploy this way

798
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,500
instead it's more convenient it's better

799
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,659
for the user for the use cases

800
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,140
better adoption more security yeah we

801
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,659
like that that's good stuff can't always

802
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,520
do that sometimes it's just impractical

803
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,799
and expensive to do either way but just

804
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,419
know there is a curse of knowledge bias

805
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,059
and there's a way to override that

806
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,460
there's also the status quo and system

807
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,039
justification bias these two go hand in

808
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,600
hand they love each other

809
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,460
um so status quo bias is we just love

810
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,919
things the way they are if it suits us

811
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,840
of course if it doesn't suit us well you

812
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,580
obviously don't like the things the way

813
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,520
they are but especially people who are

814
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,220
benefited by the way the things are they

815
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,140
tend to like things

816
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,960
um and system justification bias ensures

817
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,020
that they don't want to change and they

818
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,640
will not only just go like well that's

819
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,559
the way it's always been but they'll say

820
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,200
well we can't change it because and then

821
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,460
they'll go through a list of things to

822
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,440
say why they can't change it totally

823
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,480
disregarding maybe the reasons you're

824
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,620
giving them

825
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,380
to say well it's more expensive to do it

826
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,539
this way it's not scalable it's not

827
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,299
Deployable it's expensive but it's gonna

828
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,520
cost a lot in the short run right but

829
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,080
it's going to cost a lot less in the

830
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,840
long run right you have to you have to

831
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,360
be able to get over that bias

832
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,159
by understanding and getting someone to

833
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,679
understand that things don't have to be

834
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,960
just the way they've always been

835
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,279
and that's actually very hard to get

836
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,020
people to realize because

837
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,240
as things get more close to person like

838
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,860
business is business but when it starts

839
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,960
becoming personal and dogma and and

840
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,880
things that we all hold very strongly we

841
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,320
don't like giving it up our our brain

842
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,480
just goes like no don't want to give it

843
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,760
up because it's what helps me survive

844
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,740
it's that rustling it's that rustling

845
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,380
Bush and I need to make sure I I keep I

846
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,179
keep safe and you know I've been

847
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,039
building my brain for over 30 years and

848
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,260
so those patterns are set you know it

849
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,880
loves that it's going to take me a while

850
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,059
to to get new patterns going but uh but

851
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,159
this one's this one's kind of hard to

852
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,200
help overcome for other people

853
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,000
but just be aware of it yourself you may

854
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,399
also have status quo bias and you may

855
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,080
also have status justification bias that

856
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,299
you need to overcome yourself

857
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:56,159
prevention bias this is actually really

858
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,260
cool as I was looking at biases this is

859
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,380
an infosec bias specifically so there's

860
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,000
a study and you can go read it it's from

861
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
2021.

862
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,080
um and it's the prevention bias

863
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,000
and essentially the prevention bias says

864
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,620
when investing money to protect against

865
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,200
risks decision makers perceive that a

866
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,179
dollar spent on prevention buys more

867
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,980
security than a dollar spent on timely

868
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,140
detection and response even when

869
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,820
investing in either option is equally

870
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,919
effective so if you have a situation

871
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,779
where dollar for dollar it's equally

872
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,519
effective they're going to say nope we

873
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,480
need more prevention because that's

874
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,220
better

875
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,559
thank you Gartner magic quadrant people

876
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,179
in the prevention sector who have been

877
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,799
telling everyone ah don't detect you

878
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,299
need prevention

879
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,000
you need both

880
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,039
um and so this is actually a bias that

881
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,140
exists and we've probably dealt with

882
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,559
this all and some of us may have had

883
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,720
this bias too or have had it at some

884
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,880
point or maybe you've overcome some of

885
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,899
it

886
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,600
um this one is a little bit more of an

887
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,360
explicit bias because it's a belief well

888
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,279
prevention is better than detection that

889
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,360
is an explicit bias

890
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,399
so that's a little easier to overcome we

891
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,460
go well is it really here's actually

892
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,860
some data that shows this may not

893
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,419
actually be the case all the time and

894
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,740
you may have to show and do some extra

895
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,419
work to help someone understand and get

896
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,519
over this bias no we're doing detection

897
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,019
response now we've got plenty of

898
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,640
prevention in that prevention investment

899
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,220
we need to start doing detection and

900
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,580
response in a timely manner

901
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,159
there's also the peltzman effect

902
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,080
which is also known as the risk

903
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,700
compensation effect

904
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,039
and this is the tendency to take greater

905
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,000
risk when perceived safety increases

906
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,760
so let's say we have MFA deployed the

907
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,820
company loves it great awesome our our

908
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,740
prevention's way up we notice the tax

909
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,120
are way down the incidents are way down

910
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,460
this is fantastic we love it oh by the

911
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,899
way

912
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,600
we just went and signed up for a third

913
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,000
party SAS provider

914
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,740
and we didn't really go and look at the

915
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,659
terms and conditions or see if they were

916
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:01,799
cloud

917
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,960
certified by anybody questionnaires we

918
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,279
didn't pay attention to any of that but

919
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,899
you know what we saw that they had MFA

920
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,240
and we have MFA and we can use our MFA

921
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,740
up there and that's great so it's secure

922
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,960
right so we can go ahead and put our

923
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,460
most sensitive trade secret and

924
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,260
proprietary data up there and trust that

925
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,279
right

926
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,059
and you go

927
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,380
we didn't put MFA in place so that you

928
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,200
could go and take bigger risks

929
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,960
we put mitigations and safety in place

930
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,279
to take care of the risks you are taking

931
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,620
now we have to go through and assess

932
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,960
this new model and go here's what we got

933
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,500
to do to protect this risk and to ensure

934
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,039
this risk event doesn't happen

935
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,380
so that's uh that's a that's a little

936
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,380
bit of biases on an individual level

937
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,419
uh there's a lot more we can go into oh

938
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,279
my gosh there were so Dina's princess

939
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,220
knows there were so many that I wanted

940
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,200
to go through and they were just like no

941
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,240
no you're not gonna have time and I was

942
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,260
like no you're right I'm not gonna have

943
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,059
time

944
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,120
um so how to patch

945
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
how to patch because patching was

946
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,899
everything right patch all the things

947
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,879
um so this is not easy this is not

948
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,460
there's no prescription for this there

949
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,500
is no this is kind of a conglomeration

950
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,540
of various things I was able to read

951
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,280
that people found effective over time

952
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,440
this can be used for other people it can

953
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,379
be used for yourself but awareness

954
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,719
awareness of biases even just attending

955
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,879
this talk already you are now aware of

956
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,859
biases you're even I even went a little

957
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,960
extra and helped make you aware of

958
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,820
what's going on in your brain and swim

959
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,139
around there and kind of understand that

960
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,699
maybe made you have an existential

961
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,099
moment you're like am I the driver of

962
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,599
the meat suit

963
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,960
you know do I really make decisions

964
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,159
neurology doesn't know so just assume

965
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,300
you do for now it's better that way

966
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,359
agency is a good thing uh that's a bias

967
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,800
explicit

968
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,260
um so anyway awareness is always your

969
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,420
first step so and there's some online

970
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,339
tools I was actually stud uh going

971
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,380
across Harvard uh they have very

972
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,140
specific explicit biases that you can go

973
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,640
and test for and they'll tell you what

974
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,320
are some maybe implicit biases that are

975
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,300
feeding into some of your beliefs around

976
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,140
like vaccines or politics or uh just

977
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,079
things around society and and you know

978
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,420
uh hell interracial marriage and

979
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,859
everything like that like there's all

980
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,020
kinds of issues that they bring up that

981
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,180
people have biases over both explicit

982
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,700
and implicit and you can maybe Identify

983
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,220
some of those in you

984
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,040
um so invite feedback inviting feedback

985
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,500
is so so so so so important you know

986
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,180
it's that it's it's overcoming that

987
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,920
confirmation bias that hey I'm actually

988
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,660
doing okay because I saw this one thing

989
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,160
one time

990
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,380
um or you know the data says this but I

991
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,839
have this one friend who told me this

992
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,820
thing and so I know I'm right

993
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,740
there's some familiarity by us there too

994
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,480
another one I got one I got another one

995
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,180
in

996
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,980
but getting other feedback is very

997
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,480
important

998
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,400
um and groups that are outside of your

999
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,900
social groups or certain

1000
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,660
certainly very important also don't be

1001
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,520
defensive most of the time what we're

1002
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,200
talking about is actually implicit

1003
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,020
biases they're the hardest to detect the

1004
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,300
one that you're going to be like what I

1005
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,339
believe that is the implicit bias the

1006
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,440
one that surprises you is going to be

1007
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,420
the implicit bias don't get defensive

1008
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,740
your brain is going to want to do that

1009
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,119
by the way it's going to be like oh my

1010
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,839
gosh fight or flight this is not okay

1011
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,440
it's okay the world's not gonna fall

1012
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,460
this guy's not going to fall the world's

1013
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,740
not going to burn at least not today

1014
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,060
um maybe in 50 years

1015
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,920
um but you don't have to defend your

1016
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,780
implicit biases because as we talked

1017
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,520
about the beginning parts of the talk

1018
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,040
you don't really control those you just

1019
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,900
have those and you've learned those over

1020
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,520
time or they've been wired into your

1021
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,920
brain that's just the way it is but

1022
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,680
becoming aware of them is very important

1023
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,000
um so

1024
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,700
be open to understanding why you act or

1025
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,200
make decisions the way you do you can

1026
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
make better decisions

1027
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,140
and fourth be on the lookout for

1028
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,760
contradictory beliefs and actions like I

1029
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,440
said there's implicit biases that are of

1030
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,119
direct contradiction of your explicit

1031
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,540
beliefs

1032
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,740
whenever you see that notice wow we've

1033
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,900
got a bias somewhere if you have two

1034
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,760
opposing beliefs

1035
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,680
that you believe and someone points that

1036
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,720
out and you go wait what that's

1037
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,700
something going on one of those is based

1038
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,980
probably on up or both are based on a

1039
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,260
implicit bias of some kind and guess

1040
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,480
what your brain will let you believe

1041
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,280
both of those things that can't be true

1042
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
are true cognitive dissonance

1043
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,140
your brain survival mechanism to make

1044
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,520
sure you don't freak out about things

1045
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,880
that it thinks is good for your survival

1046
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,140
so be sure to work on overcoming that

1047
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,140
and not all biases are negative

1048
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,020
you could have a bias that kind of is

1049
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,540
positive about something

1050
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,520
maybe maybe instead of more of a

1051
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,800
pessimistic bias it's a it's a it's a

1052
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,079
it's an optimistic bias still a bias

1053
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,420
nonetheless instead of Under reporting

1054
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,740
you over report instead of

1055
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,839
underestimating you over under you

1056
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,500
overestimate you misunderestimate

1057
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,760
you misoverestimate and so uh and so be

1058
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,380
be aware of that so sometimes you might

1059
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
go well that's okay well no it's not

1060
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,280
investigate it see what it's about

1061
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,800
because again that bias is that little

1062
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
shortcut your brain's making it's that

1063
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,000
little vulnerability in your brain

1064
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
may not be making the helping you make

1065
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,320
the best decisions

1066
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,220
so I'm odd job my YouTube uh is glass of

1067
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,859
zero J you can get me on Twitter at zero

1068
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,260
DD j0 or BB you can actually get on my

1069
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,000
git lab and maybe some of the stuff at

1070
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,520
the bottom of the screen made sense uh

1071
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,160
for any of you uh there'll also be these

1072
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,780
slides up on my gitlab so you can go

1073
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,579
check that out I've got a Blog I don't

1074
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,320
maintain anymore but go ahead and go see

1075
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,180
it it's got two posts on it and of

1076
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,800
course go check out circlecine.org it's

1077
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,119
happening September 16th through the

1078
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,980
18th so

1079
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,480
um does anyone have any questions I'll

1080
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,099
try to listen really carefully and

1081
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,420
repeat them

1082
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,820
or comments or anything criticisms

1083
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,079
feedback you're totally wrong

1084
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,720
oh okay I saw the ice squint and my

1085
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,740
brain went oh he may have a question

1086
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,780
you know what I told you Dunning Kruger

1087
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,880
effect was one I was wanting to do

1088
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,240
very similar to the um

1089
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,160
go back to it

1090
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,140
curse of knowledge bias very similar to

1091
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,000
the curse of knowledge bias the Dunning

1092
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Kruger effect it's kind of when you

1093
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,619
start out and you get a little bit of

1094
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,260
experience you greatly overestimate the

1095
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,980
amount that you know

1096
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,599
and as you get more experience well as

1097
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,099
you get more experience you come off

1098
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,020
Mount stupid it's called it probably

1099
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,540
should be called that but it goes down

1100
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,460
and you kind of start realizing okay I

1101
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,260
don't know a lot of things

1102
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,660
and then you might start realizing oh

1103
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,160
yeah I actually do know quite a bit of

1104
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,260
things there's a lot of us down here in

1105
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,000
this little thing that we don't think we

1106
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,319
know a lot

1107
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,119
but we really do

1108
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,400
but also you can't really tell them from

1109
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
noobs because they'll under report

1110
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,280
they're not well these people will

1111
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,780
report their knowledge correctly we

1112
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,160
under report our knowledge when we don't

1113
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,420
think we know a lot

1114
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,980
but then the people up on the top of the

1115
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,119
mountain here who think they know a lot

1116
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,280
also report the same amount of knowledge

1117
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,359
that real experts do

1118
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,339
so yeah so the Dunning Kruger effect is

1119
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,859
very very similar and it kind of is that

1120
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,000
and then there's of course imposter

1121
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,740
syndrome for the people down here so

1122
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,000
yeah exactly

1123
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,099
uh you said it applies to everybody in

1124
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,220
here yeah it is

1125
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,599
probably applied to everybody in here at

1126
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,940
some point in your career uh unless

1127
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,500
you're at Absolute new then welcome

1128
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,440
welcome you're about to have it

1129
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,180
maybe not you'll get through it it'll be

1130
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,740
fine you know you're you're gonna do

1131
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,380
well it's great we all got here we all

1132
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,180
got where we are we're awesome people so

1133
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,020
oh question

1134
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,000
yes

1135
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,300
so the peltzman effect is named because

1136
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,480
peltzman had a study in the 70s that

1137
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,119
actually studied traffic incidents

1138
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,640
and studied a behavior mechanism where

1139
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,800
as people started putting airbags and

1140
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,140
seat belts into cars

1141
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,420
people were starting to although it did

1142
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,720
dramatically reduce fatalities of cars

1143
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,180
over time it has increased people's

1144
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,520
feeling of safety they have perceived

1145
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,260
safety so they're going to take greater

1146
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,460
risk than they would have if they didn't

1147
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,980
have those safety mechanisms in place

1148
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,140
the argument that originally was trying

1149
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,240
to be made through that though is so we

1150
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,220
shouldn't put any safety mechanisms in

1151
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,079
place

1152
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,420
okay we all laughed but did you laugh

1153
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,640
because your bias made you laugh or did

1154
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,619
you laugh because you understand so

1155
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,119
maybe that'll be an interesting thing to

1156
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,720
walk off there but uh yeah any others I

1157
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,280
like the comment that was good I like a

1158
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,000
discussion as well

1159
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,079
oh what's glass of zero Drake glass of

1160
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,240
zero J is my uh YouTube channel I just

1161
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,819
pontificate on infosex stuff uh I did

1162
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,020
stuff like

1163
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,940
um hiring if you want hot if you want

1164
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,339
seniors need to hire Juniors

1165
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,660
um I did

1166
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,359
don't stop fish testing like I literally

1167
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,800
think you should stop doing that go go

1168
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,420
see my video for that anyway enough

1169
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,859
Shameless self promotion but yeah go

1170
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,060
check out the YouTube channel it's fun I

1171
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,579
try to do a video every week uh so I

1172
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:42,960
just posted one Monday there'll be

1173
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,819
another one uh next Monday probably

1174
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:47,900
about this talk actually

1175
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,560
so how to question assumptions okay

1176
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,760
that's good

1177
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,579
um I think so various approaches right

1178
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:03,720
so

1179
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,119
depending on what your assumption is

1180
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,460
I think it's important to seek out again

1181
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,099
things that go against those assumptions

1182
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,380
you have a conclusion you believe it to

1183
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,700
be true

1184
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,200
what would it take for you to believe

1185
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,359
that it's not true think about that

1186
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,099
right and that's the way you can start

1187
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,200
taking a look at that and seeing and is

1188
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,880
there evidence out there to indicate

1189
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,180
maybe I am not and you know what it may

1190
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,040
not even be a situation where you adopt

1191
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,099
somebody else's conclusion

1192
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,319
there is a third option

1193
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,359
between true and something can either be

1194
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,980
true or not true so we're going back to

1195
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,240
logic something can either be true or

1196
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,160
not true that is there's

1197
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,560
non-contradiction identity excluded

1198
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,380
middle except there is a third option

1199
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,940
that has nothing to do with logic it's

1200
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,280
simply I don't know

1201
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,819
and so many times we're afraid to say I

1202
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,859
don't know

1203
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:59,220
and our bias fills in the blank

1204
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,540
and that's where some of those

1205
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,040
assumptions can come through so being

1206
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,020
comfortable saying I don't know it's

1207
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,579
probably a good step too how much more

1208
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:08,060
time do we have

1209
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,859

1210
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,500
