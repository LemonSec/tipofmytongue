but i'm just gonna get started and we're

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
gonna talk about vacuum bots today so

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,480
everybody with me

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,360

all right so who am i i am karan you can

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
call me kay uh i'm an engineering

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
manager at google

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,559
um

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,719
i graduated from carnegie mellon way

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
back in the time i don't want to state

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
my age

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
i write security engineering

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,519
interviewing articles at my blog and for

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
fun i travel go to the beach

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,640
quick disclosure like i work for google

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
but this research is done in my own time

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
so there is no relation whatsoever um

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,920
with them

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
all right so what are we looking at

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
today um we're gonna see why research

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
vacuum bots but like before i go into

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
all of this stuff how many of you here

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
have a vacuum board or plan to get one

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
oh wow okay how many of

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,679
us think they are secure

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,040
awesome

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,119
i've had i've had people like a few

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,119
brave souls raised their hands before

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
the talk and after the talk they were

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,159
all

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,240
anyway so we're going to talk about why

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
research vacuum bots we're going to see

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
the functionality right how they

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
actually function

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,360
then i'm going to show you a technique

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
of how you can conduct network forensics

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
by your own at your own home right

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
we'll walk through some security and

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
privacy concerns

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,680
now the next final part is the most

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,040
interesting one

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,520
i'll walk you through how i reported

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,879
issues with the vendor and the response

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,800
and finally i'll take time for q a i

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
think we're allocated about 10 minutes

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
at the end

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
so

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
please hold off your questions and then

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
we can answer them one by one

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
all right

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
all right cool

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
the real agenda is about swag

70
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,920
so

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
as as i said uh i have some nice titan

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
security keys with me which i'll be

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
giving out during the course of this

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,640
talk um as long as i get the right

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
answers from all of you

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
yes okay

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
so let's jump in uh why research vacuum

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
bots

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
so it's very simple right if you look at

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
the market that's uh going on from 2016

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
and future projections

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
it's very clear that

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
from this graph thank you grandview

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,599
research

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
every year the vacuum bar industry is

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,800
going by 17

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,560
given the number of millions of units

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
sold

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
think about that for a second they are

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
there literally everywhere

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,319
right

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
the market itself in terms of revenue is

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
growing by 23

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
every year

95
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,720
by 2027 there's going to be 60.9 million

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
of these bots around us

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,000
right

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,060
if you look at the top

99
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,400
[Music]

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
major players in this industry right

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,959
there are a few i've listed them down on

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,120
the left but what i want you to take

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
away from this slide is the right hand

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
side right notice that it's not

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,200
dominated by any particular vendor right

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
but it's also not fragmented

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
so it's kind of in the middle and that's

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
very interesting from a security point

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
of view

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,959
because you can have a lot of issues

111
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
from one vendor but none of them from

112
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
the other

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
right

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
all right

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,120
so let's jump into some functionality

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
right i'm going to go a little bit quick

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
but i want to preserve time at the end

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,238
for the most interesting stuff all right

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
so bots have different functionalities

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,919
right they can be cleaning modes like

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
you can just say hey bot go clean my

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
house that's an auto mode it's gonna do

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
its job right hopefully

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
um

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
if you say edges is gonna go around the

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,080
room so like in this room for example

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
edges would mean going all around this

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
room right the rectangle that we are in

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,520
the spot cleaning is just like oh here's

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
a dirty spot clean it for me

131
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,919
and then manuel is like you direct it

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,320
step by step right and say go left go

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,960
right go front go back

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,600
um what's interesting is you can even

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
set these bots to run on a schedule so

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,000
for example

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
for somebody like me who doesn't want to

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
get up in the morning i can say hey bart

139
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
clean my house at 6 00 am let me sleep

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
right so you can set that up

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
and finally you can also monitor

142
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
some of the health

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
of accessories

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
so i want to know when do i replace the

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
brushes on my bot and my bot can tell me

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
that

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
that's cool right

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,880
some bots also come up with a

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
functionality like floor mapping right

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
so let's say you leave a bot here it's

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
going to figure out how this room looks

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,759
like

153
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,919
that's called floor mapping

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
it can also figure out if you have more

155
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,479
than one floors so for example you have

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,680
you know the first floor and then you

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
have the second floor of the house

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,919
depending on where the bot is

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
it can intelligently figure out which

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,759
floor it is app

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,680
so some bots have this feature not every

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
bot has this feature so i just found

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
that in my research

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,720
and finally in in a few bots

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
there's also live video

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,000
honestly that scared the out of me

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
when i saw that i'm like

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
so with that understanding let's go into

169
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
how you can set up a bot right and this

170
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
is a generic example right i'm just

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
going to go through a general process

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
it's not true for everything but it's

173
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
true for most things

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,720
so let's focus on the diagram on the on

175
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
the figure here right

176
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,280
in the black box you see that's the home

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,080
network so i have the phone which is you

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
know any smartphone you have just like i

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
have here

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
i have a cable modem in my apartment to

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
talk outside to the internet and then i

182
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,479
have a bot at the bottom right

183
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,199
in the home network

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,319
when i just get a bot from you know i

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
just buy the bot and i get it in my

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
apartment i would install the app on the

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
phone right every manufacturer has an

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
app that you can install create an

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
account the very basic process right

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
when you do that it's going to create an

191
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
account on the manufacturer's website

192
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,198
right that step the first two steps

193
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
the next thing that's gonna happen

194
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
is the app is gonna search for a bot

195
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
near the phone right so it's gonna say

196
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
hey any bot nearby right

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,000
it's interesting because these bots are

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
configured to create a wi-fi network

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
right a temporary local wi-fi network

200
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
and what they're gonna do is they're

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
gonna say oh i'm here join this network

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
and once you join that network all it's

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,319
going to do is share your home's wi-fi

204
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
credentials with the bot

205
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
so this is just a way of sharing the

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
username actually the the password for

207
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
your home connection

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
right

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
and once the bots get that

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
they're gonna associate the bot

211
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
to your account

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
is everybody with me so far

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,039
cool awesome

214
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,599
now that we have an understanding of the

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,919
bot how to set them up let's talk about

216
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,759
how all of you can set up your own home

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,879
network

218
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,120
for cheap

219
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,960
so i literally took a screenshot

220
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
actually sort of sorry a photo of my own

221
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
apartment when i did this to prove that

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
i actually did this

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
and i have three components to it right

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
three major network components one is a

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
router on the left

226
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,000
the one is a switch in the middle

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,599
and then there's a cable modem at the

228
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,400
right

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
right

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,199
i'm going to ask a question and i'm

231
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
going to give out a titan key

232
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,519
what do you guys think is the cost of

233
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
this network equipment including cables

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,559
approximately the shout out numbers

235
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,760
75

236
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
who

237
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
400

238
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
450.

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
19500

240
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
350.

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
500.

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
the last one

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
too many too many let's let's go one at

244
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
a time

245
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,360
50 who's who was who was closest to oh

246
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
sorry i'll take one last one

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,959
125

248
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,360
it's actually 150 bucks so you're the

249
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,640
closest i'm gonna give you this

250
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,420
[Applause]

251
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,689
[Music]

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,959
sorry it's hard to hear everybody in

253
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,800
this room i apologize

254
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,399
yeah so approximately 150 bucks right um

255
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,480
i didn't include the cost of the devices

256
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
i had but it's not very expensive to set

257
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
this up

258
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
all right now let's look at the same

259
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
figure how it looks like you know in an

260
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
in this icon form just to make things

261
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
very simple because here the cables are

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
super messy right you cannot tell what's

263
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,440
connected to what

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,320
so

265
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
let's look to get this from left to

266
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
right okay

267
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,200
so the bot talks to the internal wi-fi

268
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,959
network okay

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,440
which talks to the switch which forwards

270
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,600
packet to my cable modem which then

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,079
talks to the external world so from left

272
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
to right is a communication from the bot

273
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
to the external world

274
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
all right and the same connection goes

275
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
back so if the bot gets a response going

276
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,760
to come back to the cable modem to the

277
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
mirror port to sorry to the to the

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
switch to the router to the bot

279
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
all right

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
to look at all the traffic going and

281
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
coming from the board i have a mirror

282
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
put on the switch so i can see

283
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
everything that the bot sees right and

284
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
i've connected a machine with running a

285
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
packet capture right so i can see

286
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
everything that's going across

287
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
notice one thing

288
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
the app is talking directly to the cable

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
modems wi-fi not to the internal wi-fi

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
and that's because i don't want to see

291
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
the phone's traffic yet right so i can

292
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
segregate the networks does it make

293
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
sense

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,839
all

295
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,000
right so with that setup and with the

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
understanding of bots let's look at how

297
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
you all can conduct forensics

298
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,680
so

299
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,480
what i did was i you know i bought bunch

300
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,920
of bots right

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
and for every setup and every step that

302
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,480
these bots can do for me like for

303
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
example the setting up that we talked

304
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,519
about the move example the clean example

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,640
the live video example i did all of that

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
for bots and i packet captured

307
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,560
everything

308
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,800
right that's the methodology i followed

309
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
and then i took those packet captures

310
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,000
and sat down for hours and analyzed them

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
it's pretty boring work but that's what

312
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
i did

313
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,279
so let's look at an example of how this

314
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,680
looks like on the network right so on

315
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
the network i know it's a little bit

316
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
small so what i did i wrote stuff down

317
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
and i want to talk you guys through this

318
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
so basically the first thing i found

319
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
when a bot talks outside from your home

320
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,839
is a very simple dns request

321
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,720
right

322
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
in most cases these bots are talking

323
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,880
outside to a cloud provider right so

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,079
basically

325
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
my home is configured to use 8.8.8 which

326
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,000
is google's dns

327
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
um

328
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
and uh

329
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
basically the response i get is the

330
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,079
cloud provider's ip

331
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,479
right so this is obvious step one right

332
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
uh-oh

333
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,079
you unfortunately brought this on

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
yourself yes

335
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
uh you reached the outrageous speaker

336
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
request portion of the evening

337
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,040
our fine friend here has told me that he

338
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,639
didn't realize that these things were

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
cool and that uh he was hoping that i

340
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
would do one for him and i said well

341
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,959
do one what he says well i don't know i

342
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,480
like root beer

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
so i said okay

344
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
what we have here

345
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,720
is two bottles of root beer

346
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
chilled delicious high quality

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
however one of these bottles has been

348
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,480
shaken

349
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
and the other has not

350
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,320
you're going to join me here at the

351
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,800
chair okay

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
the game begins when i put these on the

353
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
table

354
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
this is the new mag

355
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
over here over here that's why we got

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,279
the chair

357
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,880
the game begins when i put them down

358
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
between us

359
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,079
then you will choose

360
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,160
and we will both pick up our bottle and

361
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
open it we find out who wins and who

362
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,720
loses are we gonna do it there

363
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
before

364
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
guys

365
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,489
[Music]

366
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,100
[Applause]

367
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
all right thank you for the surprise i

368
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,880
just asked for a root beer and i get to

369
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,940
play this game so

370
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,399
[Applause]

371
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
it's awesome

372
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,920
all right so was everybody did everybody

373
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
lost track of where i was i did

374
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
anyway um yeah we looked at the first

375
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,000
dns request

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
um

377
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,959
so the ip threats return is for the

378
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
cloud provider right that's the first

379
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,680
step

380
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,360
after this because the packets are

381
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
really like big as you can see i

382
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
captured the essence of the traffic from

383
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
the following slides

384
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
so

385
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,639
what i observed is when you press move

386
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
right let's say you say turn right right

387
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
what happens is i see the following text

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
being exchanged on the network

389
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,079
right

390
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,959
so the server to bot says hey bot move

391
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,079
turn right

392
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
and the turn right is actually in xmpp

393
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
does everybody see xmpp here see that's

394
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,199
not it yeah so you see the move and spin

395
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
right as the action that's what i see on

396
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
the network

397
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,079
pretty straightforward right but then

398
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
the bot also goes back to the server and

399
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,959
says

400
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,519
result 85 i think that 85 is the is the

401
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
id of the request right so that's a very

402
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
very simple example that i saw on the on

403
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
the capture

404
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
similarly when you say oh clean the

405
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,079
house right

406
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
so it's it says okay i have the auto

407
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
setting on i'll clean it with the speed

408
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
of strong

409
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
this is the extra data i really like to

410
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240
see

411
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
um and then it finally says okay i

412
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,079
cleaned it the clean report is that

413
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,120
right so

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,839
exchange of packets

415
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,560
i also saw keeper lives

416
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
so

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
this is something i didn't really think

418
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,279
about but then it really made sense to

419
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,240
me right so if your bot is is connected

420
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
to your home network and it's not

421
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
running

422
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,639
it's not doing anything

423
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
it may still communicate out and say i'm

424
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,839
still here

425
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,638
make sense

426
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,320
let's talk about authentication because

427
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,839
we never talked about this is a security

428
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
conference so what are we doing right

429
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
um there are two ways of authentication

430
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,360
that i found right one was sasl

431
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,079
um sasl can be used with you know a

432
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,800
number of protocols but in this case i

433
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,120
actually saw plain text passwords

434
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
we'll talk about vendor stuff after this

435
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,079
so we'll see how that goes

436
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
and then the bot says success

437
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
all right

438
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
fortunately not all bots are like that

439
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
some bots actually say hey i'm gonna use

440
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,520
mqtt mqtt is for iot devices for those

441
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
who you may not know but it's secure so

442
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,559
it can use like

443
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,640
8.8883 and it can communicate out from

444
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,280
that port and it does not use plaintext

445
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
so

446
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
while that's a relief i was

447
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,600
not very happy

448
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
and finally

449
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,000
i also saw something very interesting

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
when i did not do anything

451
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,080
so

452
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,559
when i when i have a phone right

453
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,440
and i open the app on the phone

454
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,760
as soon as i open the app

455
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,039
i saw

456
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
these packets i saw this data

457
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
and i'll walk you through what that is

458
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,080
right so as soon as i open the app i see

459
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
a request called set time

460
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
and i see the time those numbers one six

461
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
five one five right that's an epoch time

462
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,080
so time since 1970 is january 1st right

463
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
in seconds

464
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,840
and it says tz timezone i assume minus

465
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
seven

466
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,559
basically what's happening is the bot is

467
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,280
getting the time from my phone

468
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
because i was in california at the time

469
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,679
so timezone makes sense to me

470
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,480
and it's setting its own time as my

471
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
phone's time

472
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,640
anybody see issues with that

473
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,440
people are nodding their heads

474
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
you can tell where somebody is exactly i

475
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
think that's what you were saying thank

476
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
you yes and we'll get to that uh later

477
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
all right so i guess people must have

478
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
figured out the issues but i'm going to

479
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
walk through them and show you the

480
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
interesting parts

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,280
so can somebody control our bots can

482
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,600
somebody hijack them right

483
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
and there are two ways of looking at

484
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,720
this one

485
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
your local network right can somebody be

486
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
in your home

487
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
a friend walks in as like hey i want to

488
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
use your wi-fi cool and starts

489
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
monitoring your packets

490
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,679
can happen

491
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,280
um and the second one is remote

492
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,039
attackers right can somebody just

493
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,919
external you don't know can they hijack

494
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
the bar

495
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
well if somebody is local

496
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,400
then yes they can replay commands right

497
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
if there's no such nonce there's no such

498
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,280
identifier that's unique they can do

499
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
replay and it will work

500
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,799
for for remote that's not very easy to

501
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
do right the easiest way for a remote

502
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
attacker to get control of your bot is

503
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
to just attack your credentials figure

504
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
out a way to get your credentials and

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,360
they're in

506
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,640
and as i kind of expected there is no

507
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,960
two-factor auth

508
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
none whatsoever

509
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,799
what about floor plans so we remember

510
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
the bots can scan your home right all

511
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
the floors if you want them to

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,120
the the way these bots store that data

513
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
is either on the app so locally on your

514
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,160
phone

515
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
or in the cloud

516
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
right

517
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
again like it's it's a part of the app

518
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
so it's data on your phone so if your

519
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
phone is vulnerable yes you can get that

520
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
but app credentials are again the

521
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
easiest to get through that right

522
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
and by the way

523
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
this app does not need to be attacked by

524
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
its own you can have other

525
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,360
vulnerabilities on your phone that can

526
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
compromise the app so your full plan can

527
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,679
be leaked right so there's so many ways

528
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
that your floor plan can be leaked not

529
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,039
just because of a particular app

530
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,720
in the research i did i did not

531
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
explicitly discover that this was being

532
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
leaked like for example i did not see

533
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,240
any packets

534
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,840
but that doesn't mean it's not a

535
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
possibility

536
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
right

537
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
somebody rightly mentioned actually two

538
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
people course location right and this is

539
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
this is very spot-on

540
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
as the user moves around the bot will

541
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
say oh i am this time zone and actually

542
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
i actually discovered this accidentally

543
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,919
i was i think i was messing with my time

544
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,159
so i was traveling i don't remember

545
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,840
but as soon as the time change on my

546
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,679
phone the bot had a really messy

547
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
schedule of cleaning and i'm like

548
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
something is wrong

549
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
and i figured out that it was this this

550
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,120
was the case right so the time zone had

551
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
changed on my phone

552
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
the bot thought oh it's like

553
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
a.m pacific when it's really like 6 a.m

554
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,240
or 12 p.m right so it really messed up

555
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,679
the schedule

556
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,600
everybody with me so far

557
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
all right awesome

558
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,080
i have two more swags to give so

559
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
let's talk about video recordings right

560
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,120
here i try to show you people how it

561
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
looks like on the network right i know

562
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
the text is very small because wireshark

563
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,080
but if you see on the right there is

564
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,960
some metadata that you can capture just

565
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,520
by looking at the traffic so thankfully

566
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
i don't see video itself like i don't

567
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
see any video encodings being passed

568
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,760
around but i do see metadata involving

569
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
that recording so

570
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,159
for example it can say oh start

571
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,159
streaming at this time right so i can

572
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
figure out when the live video was

573
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,919
started stuff like that

574
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,400
as you can see on the left um there's

575
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,039
udp traffic so pretty obvious right it's

576
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,320
it's video

577
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,639
um but yeah nothing very sensitive

578
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
all right the fun part begins

579
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,919
so i took all these findings so i took

580
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
me a few months to figure this out and i

581
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,840
wrote a really long email to the vendor

582
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,200
and to prove that i did i took

583
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,799
screenshots so you don't have to read

584
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
this i already described all these

585
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
issues to you all of you

586
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,120
but i just did to show you the dates and

587
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
my name so

588
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,919
notice the dates so right now the first

589
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,480
email or first notification

590
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
was november

591
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,039
18th 2019. i don't know it's a bit small

592
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,960
but i'll say it out loud

593
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,520
november 1819 first report right i say

594
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
hey report of these issues blah blah

595
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
blah and a big detailed email on how i

596
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,039
found them

597
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,720
all right

598
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
i went on to describe more issues so i

599
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,320
said okay

600
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,200
using insecure protocols xmpp potential

601
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,440
man in the middle right

602
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
course location tracking i go on and on

603
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,480
and on

604
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
i don't know who read that email sorry

605
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
um and then finally left privacy of

606
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,640
floor plans

607
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,280
so i wrote all of this and i said

608
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,559

all right can anybody guess

611
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,360
what happened next

612

i'll take one by one i know a lot of

613
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,520

615
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,039
little bit louder

they sent the lawyers oh god i'm still

617
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,679
here

618
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
but yes that's a good guess

619
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
i'm sorry

620
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,520
amazing reply

622
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,239

623
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
good one

624
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
sorry let's do it from the front

625
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,120
automated response

626
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
exactly

627
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
so

628
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,159
they said

629
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,559
they said oh hello

630
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,320
we love to hear what you think of our

631
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
service

632
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,799
and they asked me to rate

633
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,799
the response somebody said no response

634
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,159
that was close but i still got a

635
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,240
response so she's more accurate

636
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,669
[Music]

637
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,640
all right so

638
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
i wasn't particularly happy after

639
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,880
putting all these hours and stuff so

640
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,120
i followed up and said hey like this is

641
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
not done i need something back

642
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
can you please take a look

643
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
so that's the reply i sent back i

644
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,080
basically said you know responsible

645
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
disclosure you have 90 days right i can

646
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
go out in the public and talk about this

647
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
but i'm not going to do it because i

648
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
care so you know please take a look

649
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
december 17th after almost a month i

650
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,360
heard back a response right and the

651
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,440
parts i want everybody to read are the

652
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,840
one in red

653
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
it basically says

654
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,720
we have implemented xmpp

655
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,600
which is an older model okay

656
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,720
all our new models use secure technology

657
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,159
to ensure user security

658
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,120
does that mean the older models do not

659
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,520
ensure security

660
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,960
i don't know

661
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
so

662
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,480
i followed up again and i said hey this

663
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,320
is not done right

664
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,159
february 19th so we are now from

665
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
november to february right they said

666
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
thank you for your concern we appreciate

667
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,559
the feedback i'm passing these notes to

668
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
the application team you know all of

669
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,880
that so i said okay i'll wait

670
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
i still didn't disclose

671
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
march 30th

672
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
i said hey it's been a long time can you

673
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,960
assign a cve or cwe something to give me

674
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,240
credit

675
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
um please do not delay this matter any

676
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
further there are millions of these

677
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,679
balls out there thank you for your

678
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,640
prompt response

679
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
okay

680
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
after seven months

681
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,880
july 28th right so from november to july

682
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,440
i finally got this response it says

683
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
thank you for writing i mean they've

684
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
thanked me three times i i don't think i

685
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
want that

686
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
and then they said we have escalated

687
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,760
your concerns to the related department

688
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,679
what department

689
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,279
one final guess

690
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,880
what happened next i'm gonna take five

691
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,240
people

692
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
just to save time

693
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
start right from the back blue gentlemen

694
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
please

695
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,640
yes

696
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,559
they just closed it and

697
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,279
they closed it

698
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
they didn't disclose it

699
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,279
i disclosed it oh okay i'm that's what

700
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,760
i'm doing here now

701
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
so bribe me

702
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,559
so the response was they offered me a

703
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
new model to not disclose this well i

704
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
it didn't happen and i'm still talking

705
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,399
about this three more people um

706
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
gentlemen here

707
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
they closed it

708
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
they ghosted

709
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
exactly

710
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,000
yep so even today i don't have a

711
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
response however

712
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,440
the newer models seem to be more secure

713
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
and i wonder why

714
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,880
in conclusion if you think about these

715
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,720
iot devices they're all over the place

716
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
right they use insecure protocols

717
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
it's very challenging to get a response

718
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,279
like look i understand that you want to

719
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,880
ship to the market right this

720
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,320
competition

721
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
but it's very hard to balance security

722
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
and privacy right that's where i was

723
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,600
coming from

724
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
and out of this talk if you don't take

725
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
anything just take that you know cannot

726
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,440
trust any device right away right figure

727
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
out a way to research this on your own

728
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,039
that's the real takeaway and you can do

729
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,960
this for really cheap cost right you

730
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
want to spend a lot of money

731
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,120
um and if you have any questions i'm

732
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
happy to take them now but thanks for

733
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,200
keeping it clean

734
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,550
[Music]

735
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,320
i think i ended like 30 minutes early so

736
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,960
uh yes

737
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
yeah so the question is did i reach out

738
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
on twitter and tag them

739
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
that's a good idea i just didn't want to

740
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,760
take anything publicly so i did not i

741
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,120
just wanted to document everything in

742
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,919
writing but maybe in the future i will

743
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,520
yes i'll take all questions now i'm not

744
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,240
selecting people so yes

745
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,760
yes so the question is did they issue a

746
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,679
cv or no they did not issue anything

747
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,600
there's there's no public

748
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
disclosure or vulnerability around this

749
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
but yeah uh people can use the mic so i

750
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
don't have to like come back if you guys

751
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,799
don't mind using the mic that'd be

752
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,159
awesome

753
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,919
um yeah so just from a purely pragmatic

754
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,159
perspective of someone who wants a

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,240
robotic vacuum but hasn't gotten one yet

756
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,559
because of all the privacy issues

757
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,240
and i don't really care whether it

758
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,760
violates my

759
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
privacy securely or not are you aware of

760
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,960
any other any other research or any

761
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
research you've done yourself into like

762
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,279
modifying them just purely for personal

763
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,480
privacy

764
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,960
or any that are better on that or

765
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
anything like that

766
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
so sorry your mice moisture voice was a

767
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,840
bit muffled but i think i understand

768
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,440
your question you said are there any

769
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,360
other security privacy research around

770
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
this on other bots and overall

771
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,679
right specifically just to a purely

772
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
pragmatic perspective of like modifying

773
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,000
one or which one to buy from a

774
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
perspective of just enhancing personal

775
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,279
privacy

776
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,360
while using one yes so we have a

777
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
conference this week called defcon

778
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
and uh if you look at previous talks of

779
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
defcon there is actually i think one or

780
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
two talks that break down a particular

781
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,240
vendor and talk about it so i can share

782
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,159
the links later but there are existing

783
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,799
work on this yes hey uh thank you very

784
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,919
much for this talk by the way i really

785
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
appreciate this is really eye-opening um

786
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
one thing i wanted to ask is do you

787
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
suppose do you know what maybe hardware

788
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,559
they used inside the bot because i i

789
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,000
know like esp like 88 32s or whatever i

790
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,919
mean they support ssl

791
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,840
they're like a dollar and i just don't

792
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
understand like you can get

793
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
you can go out and get the certificates

794
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,919
you can validate the cert chain i just

795
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,399
don't it just seems like even like dog

796
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,200
one dollar microcontrollers can do this

797
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
like what's the point i don't really see

798
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
the time to market the tcp stack is

799
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,200
built into the esps i believe it is

800
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,039
right i've done asp and i never had to

801
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,200
do anything tcp it was just there yeah i

802
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
just don't understand like

803
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,039
what they're missing i've done sassel on

804
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,840
xmpp but it was encrypted right i i

805
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,440
wasn't on a vacuum bot but i just don't

806
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,720
understand like do you have any idea

807
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,760
like why when it's a dollar to just get

808
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,919
this amount just block your thing lock

809
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,240
the thing out put ssl on it get the full

810
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
searching like what are they what are

811
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
they gaining by this like i just don't

812
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,000
understand 10 years from now the bot

813
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,240
might not work because a new ca came out

814
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
or something like that i anyway i'm just

815
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,320
curious if you have any ideas on that oh

816
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,000
no excellent point right as you said

817
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
it's not very expensive to build in

818
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
security

819
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,039
and by the way this is a bot i tested in

820
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,440
2019. so i'm sure it was released a year

821
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,000
or two ago so we are talking 2017 time

822
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,440
frame maybe

823
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,120
um at that time maybe there was a

824
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,039
prioritization decision i honestly do

825
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
not know the answer but i'm going to

826
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,960
make some educated guesses right maybe

827
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,120
there's a competition to ship products

828
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,640
maybe there is something that they want

829
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
to prioritize as a feature but not as

830
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
security maybe they said okay a password

831
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,200
is good enough we don't really care

832
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
about like the technology so much it's

833
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,120
working let's ship and let's reiterate

834
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,080
on this

835
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,120
um

836
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,440
one of the other reasons i've seen is

837
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,679
they have improved security iteratively

838
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,159
so the newer models as i said are better

839
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,480
right so maybe that was a backlog i

840
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,240
don't really know i'm gonna guess those

841
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,880
were some factors if that makes sense

842
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,159
yes did you uh can am i muffled can you

843
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,919
hear me sorry i can't i have a hard time

844
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,120
hearing you i was going to say my

845
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
mouthful can you hear me um did you try

846
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
any like so one of the interesting

847
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,279
things is that i've found similar

848
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,120
vulnerabilities in devices like

849
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,600
with network attached devices and when i

850
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
made the disclosure i explained that you

851
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,600
can use the stun protocol in a web

852
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
browser to be able to detect these

853
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
devices within the network right and

854
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
then send packets from them within the

855
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,840
network without having to be physically

856
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,760
there did you investigate those kind of

857
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,440
things because it looks to me as though

858
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,519
you might be able to do a cross protocol

859
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,640
attack from a web browser onto the

860
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
the roomba like device itself without

861
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,799
having to physically be in the network

862
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,480
and then primary defense was like oh you

863
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,760
have to be physically in the know what

864
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,679
to do which i disagree with

865
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,080
yes so that's a great point so there are

866
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
some bots for which there's emulators

867
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,360
written out if you can find them on

868
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,440
github right and you can say oh like i

869
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,760
don't need a bot i can emulate the bar

870
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,200
and you could do it on your local

871
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,039
network right away and the moment you do

872
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,799
that that means that you can send

873
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,679
commands to a real bond by capturing how

874
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
the emulator works so you mentioned stun

875
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
yeah in this case i didn't observe stun

876
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,679
but like that's an example that you can

877
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
use i wasn't saying that the bot itself

878
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,679
was talking stunned but you can use us a

879
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,600
couple of different web apis to be able

880
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
to discover the ip address of these web

881
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,240
or it's not actually a web protocol but

882
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
it's a protocol that is plain text so

883
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,000
you can send it over a web browser okay

884
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
then you can when a victim loads a web

885
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
page you can get the web page to send

886
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
requests to the robot by using these

887
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
apis to discover its ip address and that

888
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,280
would allow you to bypass the whole like

889
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,639
you have to be physically in the network

890
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,000
restriction yeah i think i understand

891
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,280
what they're saying i

892
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,918
so for my research the scope was network

893
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,520
and not i didn't go to the web browser

894
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
and send apis hey that can be a

895
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
follow-up research on top of this yeah

896
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,679
you can definitely send xml structures

897
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,440
over the network to devices exactly

898
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,119
hello uh great talk by the way um i was

899
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,520
wondering in regards to the the robot

900
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,079
having its own wi-fi uh when you when

901
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,359
you initially set it up is this

902
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,359
something that is always exposed and and

903
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,800
do you know if there's anything more you

904
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,119
can do with that to

905
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,480
trick it into taking commands or so

906
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,560
yeah so i i didn't dig deep into that

907
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
specific ssid because it's like

908
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,160
temporary they just if you press a

909
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,640
button on it that's when it pops up okay

910
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
but i i will be hesitant to say that

911
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,920
they will accept commands because the

912
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,400
bot is not set up yet the bot is not

913
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
registered with an account yet like it's

914
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,599
not associated

915
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,560
so

916
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,359
i'm gonna guess no but given this i

917
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,520
don't know there might be some new ones

918
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,960
that they have not really you know

919
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,880
tracked that really well so

920
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,119
and one more was uh have you have you

921
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,440
heard about the incidents where there

922
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
are just people sending out cleaning

923
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
commands to their neighbors and stuff

924
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,280
and messing around with their bots

925
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
i have not i mean given shodan and

926
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,480
everything around us

927
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,760
you you can

928
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
write to talk and deliver it right here

929
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,119
that'll be awesome all right thank you

930
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
yeah

931
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,000
so uh my question is uh did you test the

932
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,200
same

933
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,320
did you see the same packet uh pattern

934
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
in the new updated version i did not so

935
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,079
they started using ssl that was good so

936
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,680
i did buy some recent balls i'm not

937
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,920
gonna name them but i could not see

938
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
anything on the network i was very happy

939
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,920
with that for some reason

940
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,240
and did you saw those pattern in one

941
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
specific vendor or the previous one in

942
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,280
one specific vendor or okay i'm not

943
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,119
gonna ask vice president or you saw it

944
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,520
in multiple vendors

945
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,240
yeah yeah so this was one particular one

946
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,040
but i did test several of them and i

947
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,480
think in the last two or three years

948
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,320
most are using ssl

949
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,760
so you will not see most things on the

950
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
network and that's why i'm actually able

951
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,920
to give this talk because it's over now

952
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,119
thank you thank you

953
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
so you mentioned that it's more secure

954
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,320
are the newer iterations of their

955
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
products tend to be more secure and i

956
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
just heard that there's ssl yeah i'm

957
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
wondering if there's a

958
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
if there's still aspects that you want

959
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
to investigate on these newer devices

960
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,800
that you think is probably still an

961
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
active area of concern

962
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,359
it seems to me like the provisioning one

963
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,960
where you know there's a step that

964
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,079
you're sending maybe credentials over

965
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,520
an open

966
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
temporary network created by the device

967
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
that it would be a good opportunity to

968
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,760
sniff and get a password to somebody's

969
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,359
home network

970
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,440
but i i mean i just want to hear what

971
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,119
other things you think there may be to

972
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
look at on these newer devices that you

973
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,079
think are at least for now more secure

974
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,160
yeah i mean great question right this is

975
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,000
basically asking how you can extend this

976
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,960
research

977
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,800
um a couple of things right look for

978
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
pinned certificates

979
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,720
look for self signed certificates see if

980
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,520
you can break ssl that would be awesome

981
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,760
not so much for users but

982
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
for improving security i should be

983
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,160
careful this is being recorded um

984
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,400
and then um i think other things include

985
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,119
like

986
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,119
because there's always new manufacturers

987
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,800
coming out right if you saw the market

988
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
it's it's not like

989
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
super fragmented but there's every time

990
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,680
there's new ones on amazon and best buy

991
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,720
pick one and see what you can see

992
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,680
all right thank you very much

993
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,839
thanks for the talk so you're touching

994
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,760
this a bit during the qa process can you

995
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,200
be a little bit louder please you

996
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,560
touched on this a bit during the qa

997
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
process right now and you mentioned that

998
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,280
there were a couple of the other ones

999
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,359
that you tested yes um but specifically

1000
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,960
the device that was presented here was

1001
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
that one tested because you had it and

1002
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,400
so you tested it or that was the worst

1003
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,920
of the bunch do you still have it

1004
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,200
operating in your house or did you take

1005
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,240
that one and shut it down and use

1006
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
something that was more secure i feel

1007
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,640
like i'm socially engineered here

1008
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
i first have to get on your network so

1009
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,119
yes so apparently it was given to me by

1010
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,960
somebody i did not go and buy it and i

1011
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
was like i want to see what's happening

1012
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,839
on the network and then i found this and

1013
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,320
i'm like huh i should research this more

1014
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
it's not on my network anymore if that's

1015
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,680
what you're asking i think the other

1016
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,520
guy's social engineered you but

1017
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,880
in short you tested that one

1018
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,320
specifically just because you had it it

1019
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,079
wasn't you didn't target that one or

1020
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,280
test it

1021
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
okay yeah it was out of curiosity

1022
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,560
awesome thank you so much thank you

1023
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,839
thank you for

1024
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,359
thank you for talking

1025
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,480
two questions

1026
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,240
the first one is like

1027
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
from what i could see the bots

1028
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,839
use a password to authenticate to the

1029
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,160
service was that your password or do

1030
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,320
they all use the same one

1031
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
excellent question so i think it's a

1032
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,920
combination of well they use the

1033
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,040
password i provided in for the app but

1034
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,640
it's not directly that password it's

1035
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,720
like it's encoded and then it's padded

1036
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
with something so yeah you can figure

1037
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
out what what it is just by looking at

1038
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,359
that

1039
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,599
okay yeah the second one is i think i

1040
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
heard seven months you waited why didn't

1041
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,839
you just go public

1042
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,280
it was seven months away how did i i

1043
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
think i heard you waited once at one

1044
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,000
point seven months uh for reply why

1045
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,240
didn't you just go public sooner like

1046
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,079
why didn't i give this talk sooner or

1047
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,359
just write something up on the internet

1048
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,599
and then giving it so

1049
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,480
yeah

1050
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,400
i'm impressed with your patience i guess

1051
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,040
what i'm saying yeah so actually so i

1052
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
wanted to be a little bit patient with

1053
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,359
them being able to fix it i give them

1054
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
more time on purpose

1055
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,680
i actually wanted a cve right away that

1056
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,920
was my push as long as they have a cve

1057
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
like my intentions are good right like

1058
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
it's publicly resourced

1059
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,800
um

1060
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
i think there was no cfps at the time i

1061
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,920
don't know maybe i should find a

1062
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
conference to talk earlier but i just

1063
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
waited just to make sure that i have my

1064
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,079
bases covered i get approval from where

1065
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,520
i work to talk about this there was a

1066
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,760
lot going on at the back end for me to

1067
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
become comfortable talking about this

1068
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,359
now i have all the approvals so i was

1069
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,680
like sure okay yep thank you thank you

1070
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,200
one more question because i think this

1071
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,720
would be kind of funny

1072
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,400
what do you think about the prospects of

1073
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,560
putting a bot on a bot

1074
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
a botnet if you figure out how i bought

1075
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,920
assuming that this is their practice in

1076
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,560
terms of making these devices yeah how

1077
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
easy is it you think to maybe find an

1078
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,359
overflow or some other thing inject some

1079
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,640
some kind of

1080
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,280
program execute a bot i would be very

1081
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
scared

1082
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
by that by that idea

1083
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,680
um but i give it a shot

1084
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,760
oh yeah that would be cool to see all

1085
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,880
right thank you thank you

1086
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,480
so should i just clean on my own or

1087
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,920
should i buy a

1088
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,200
irobot what's your advice

1089
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,800
i it seems like a rigged question

1090
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,040
i think the general advice is don't buy

1091
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
the most cheapest ones i guess in

1092
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,079
general because by default the cost is a

1093
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,079
significant amount of investment that

1094
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,839
goes into building the board and they

1095
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,680
may not be invested so much into

1096
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,200
security right

1097
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
so that's general advice but it doesn't

1098
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
mean that every low-cost bot is not

1099
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
secure right if you buy high-end ones

1100
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,119
most likely fine generally okay

1101
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,839
all right

1102
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,150
no further question thank you

1103
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,900
[Applause]
