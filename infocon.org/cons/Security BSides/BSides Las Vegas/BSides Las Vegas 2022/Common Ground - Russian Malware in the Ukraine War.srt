to see the us again

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
because i was having not so much fun in

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
ukraine when the war started

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
so this talk is going to be about some

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
of the things that i saw firsthand and

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
some of the ongoing things that i'm

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
still working on with various groups of

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
people

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,879
computer emergency response teams etc

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,080
and parts of the ukrainian government

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
so

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,519
if you don't know me to make this slide

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,080
really short i've written about uh

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,319
written now 14 technical books

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,920
um i teach how to uh hack

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
uh whether it be it iot or control

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
systems i have a background in nuclear

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,000
cyber industry as well as oil and gas

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
and sometimes i have fancy titles like

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
the distinguished chair of the cyber

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
security and emerging technology program

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
at the middle east institute

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,879
i always have to say with the posh

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
accent because titles are weird

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,879
so i like to hack stuff

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
so

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,879
when

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,840
i first got this call in february

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
going hey chris would you like to come

88
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
to ukraine and i'm like i don't know the

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,080
news looks pretty grim

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,480
they're like well but you know we're

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,640
kind of afraid of a nuclear cyber

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,239
incident you've kind of handled a few of

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
those and i'm like well it might be good

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
if you prepare

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
i kind of delayed my decision for a week

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
and then ended up on the last air france

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
flight to

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,640
keith

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
on the 20th of february yay great timing

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,519
right

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
and it was great before the war started

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
i even tweeted to uh some of my uh

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,720
girlfriends going hey you know it's

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
affordable here they give you like a

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
little seat thing for your purse we

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
gotta do a girls week weekend and cave

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
yes

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
age like milk

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
uh so

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
i was in ukraine when the started

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
hitting the fan basically

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,920
and after i got settled into my hotel

113
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,519
which happened to be the same hotel that

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,959
all the journalists were staying at the

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
intercontinental

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
um things started happening

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,478
very quickly

118
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,600
and this i will say the same type of

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
playbook has been playing out

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
and most european and nato countries

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
right now

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,759
uh just uh following a different

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
timeline

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,560
so we had uh the first

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
grouping of attacks which were very

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,560
interesting because some of them were

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
also used as

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,600
misinformation by russia as part of

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
their justification to move into the

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,160
west early on excuse me east early on

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
and then the rest of the ukraine

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
so we're going to talk about fun stuff

133
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,360
like who likes clean water

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
except before the russian tanks come in

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,120
obviously they don't want clean water

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
there

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,039
um

138
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,160
fun fact up until about october of last

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
year

140
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,400
um it was still legal to own

141
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,280
telecommunications infrastructure in the

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
ukraine as a russian citizen they

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
finally made that illegal for obvious

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,400
reasons

145
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
but as we all know it's very hard to

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
change around a bunch of infrastructure

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
so the same stuff that was there

148
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,479
was here when the uh war attack when the

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,840
war started

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,719
who likes money

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,759
we're in vegas baby right yeah

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,440
yeah especially when a war is about to

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
break out you kind of need cash

154
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
um

155
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
the human effects of what's been going

156
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
on with some of the malware that's been

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,639
sent to ukraine

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,080
and uh what happens when your government

159
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
doesn't function very well how you can

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
recover from that

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,680
so

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
like i said who likes cash

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
it's awesome i heard some woohoo there

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
so one of the first things that hit

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
while i was in the capital city was uh

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
atm machines stopped working

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
uh throughout the city on monday

168
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
uh so the 21st of february

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
uh you also couldn't exchange currency

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
very easily so i come from

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
a euro country the netherlands

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,039
and uh

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
you know i i didn't really come with a

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,960
whole bunch of ukrainian currency so

175
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
made things difficult uh but this is one

176
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
of these playbook items where russia

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,120
started uh instilling a bit of fear uh

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
there was russian

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
media saying no we're not gonna start a

180
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
war with ukraine uh while troops start

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
building up and all sorts of stuff start

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,240
happening especially in the east

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
um so people wanted cash you know just

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
in case

185
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
um

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
the ukrainian government had been

187
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
telling people for months

188
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,160
uh to start packing emergency go bags

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
and things of that nature

190
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,520
uh because they were actually prepared

191
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
thinking hey with all these troops

192
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
it doesn't look that great i don't know

193
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,520
about you but russia they're really

194
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
crappy neighbors uh so um

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
people couldn't get money out

196
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
sometimes they could not log into their

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,319
banking account

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,319
now imagine if you're like oh man

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
russian troops are surrounding us and i

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
can't get money out and i have kids or

201
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,560
family or someone i have to worry about

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
um and i can't go north because that's

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
where belarus is kind of close to

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
belarus the capital city

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,599
couldn't go you know east because that's

206
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,960
where lots of russian troops were

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
amassing um so how do you get through

208
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
without this thing called credit cards

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,080
and google pay and apple pay

210
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,599
ukraine

211
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,680
for the war it's actually quite uh

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
advanced in its digital technology

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
so most places use a lot of apple pay or

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,080
google pay but what's his cash stuff

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,720
so that began

216
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
then in the east

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,919
the uh province of luhansk

218
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
all of a sudden uh all of their water

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
facilities were hit by a cyber attack

220
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
uh the russian government tried to say

221
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
look at what ukraine is doing to our

222
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,680
citizens they're cutting off water to

223
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
our citizens that's why we have the

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
right to protect ethnic russians in the

225
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
east

226
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
um obviously that was not the case

227
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
ukraine had no reason to launch cyber

228
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
attacks against the water infrastructure

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
in the east

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
but uh things can be used and misused a

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
lot when it comes to war

232
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,599
so

233
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,719
as uh i was there for the 24th getting

234
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
woken up by shelling

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
and as the sun rose could see columns of

236
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
smoke and more getting blown up and

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
we decided to evacuate because you know

238
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
it's kind of a good idea when you're

239
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,320
told there's a column of tanks coming to

240
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
the capital city from russia

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,399
and you don't know if they're going to

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,519
bomb you

243
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
and oh look at our evacuation point we

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,160
can see paratroopers in the sky and

245
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,959
they're not ukrainian so uh it was kind

246
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,399
of a good idea to get the hell out of

247
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
the capital city

248
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
and that also meant

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,160
being on a very long ride to the border

250
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
we actually chose syria romania because

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
to the west everyone was heading there

252
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
so there were traffic jams going to

253
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,279
poland obviously you could not go to the

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
north to belarus or the east where the

255
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
russian troops were coming in

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
luckily for a win for technologists

257
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
a teenage boy

258
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,399
used his

259
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
personal drone and saw the column of

260
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
tanks and was able to contact the

261
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
ukrainian army and they were able to

262
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
destroy that column of tanks before they

263
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,880
actually got to the capital city

264
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
so uh win-win hey

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,480
that's why i love to see kids here uh

266
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,440
doing hacking stuff because you know hey

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
prove positive you can actually change

268
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
things and save lives with it

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
so

270
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
we had a a very long ride to the border

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,040
and a bus

272
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
well we call it a bus in europe but it's

273
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
a sprinter van

274
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,160
from mercedes with uh that fit 26 people

275
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,040
um my friend todd here has a sprinter

276
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,920
van

277
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
and

278
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
you look inside and you're like 26

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
people fit in here yes because we're

280
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
european so we like to squeeze into

281
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
small places

282
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
uh so we had a convoy a car and one of

283
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
these sprinter vans

284
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
and there were three people driving the

285
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,800
two vehicles myself being one of them

286
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
for driving 24

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
hours straight kind of thing then trying

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
to get to the border by the way they

289
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,519
were kids i got to set the stage because

290
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
i'm not used to kids they don't let you

291
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
sleep

292
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
holy crud if you're a parent i'm so

293
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,399
sorry

294
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,120
i sympathize

295
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,079
right

296
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
luckily they thought we were just on a

297
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
camping trip

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,399
uh so uh you know they didn't realize

299
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,480
and i'm glad they didn't that their home

300
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
in the capital city was gone

301
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,079
they had no way to see their

302
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,000
grandparents again

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
uh so camping trip it is

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,279
so

305
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
we get close to the border we're like

306
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920


307
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,079
oh it's uh let's see it's nine

308
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,480
kilometers it's about six miles long

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
uh just the chaotic uh

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
drive to the border because ukraine

311
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
required an exit procedure

312
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,040
and

313
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,839
uh

314
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,480
when i say a six mile long line that's

315
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,079
like oh well maybe you can get through

316
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,640
in four to six hours no no no no no no

317
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
is days

318
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,079
and the reason being uh which i found

319
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
out the first night we spent the night

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
in the bus waiting

321
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
near the border

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
with the kids who did not let me sleep

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,399
um

324
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,040
was that uh the border patrol in the

325
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,800
ukraine had been hit by

326
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
a wiper virus

327
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
so

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
when we got close enough

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
to actually speak to senior officials at

330
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
the border patrol

331
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,360
um that's when uh

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,000
i could uh actually verify with them

333
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,519
what was going on

334
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
uh what assistance was needed and so

335
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,160
forth now imagine the picture that you

336
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
see in the news of all these cars lined

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
up all around trying to get the hell out

338
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
of ukraine right

339
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
but they were all on

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
pencil and paper

341
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,120
using a landline to double check things

342
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
because the wiper virus removed their

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,639
database

344
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
in a series of databases

345
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
so um this was a bad thing because it

346
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
was really cold

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,839
and uh there was a petrol station or

348
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,600
gasoline station on each side of the

349
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
road about three miles

350
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
four miles back from the border

351
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
and uh you know for us and i guess one

352
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
lady did not want to wait or go to the

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,360
forest

354
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,519
and she actually froze to death standing

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,120
in line waiting to use the toilet at

356
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
this petrol station

357
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,839
gasoline was limited to buy so

358
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,000
for example we had to leave only the

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
seat heaters on for myself and the

360
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
alternate driver to keep moving all

361
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
night long but we couldn't afford the

362
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
fuel to heat the rest of the bus

363
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,519
so everybody just piled underneath piles

364
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
of clothes because we did not know if we

365
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
would be able to have enough fuel for

366
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
four or five days to wait on the border

367
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
with heat

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
so imagine cars that ran out of gas that

369
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
had handicapped folks that had babies

370
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
etc etc and there was no extra food or

371
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,920
water

372
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,399
or you know a toilet that you could use

373
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,240
without chancing up freezing to death

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,959
all because of a malware attack

375
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
that's one thing we have to understand

376
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,880
as technologists is this stuff now has

377
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,760
really real world consequences

378
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
uh it isn't just a news item that goes

379
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,399
ooh another exploit i can use

380
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
well yeah

381
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,920
but then sometimes i kill people and in

382
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,440
this case this was one of the things

383
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
so

384
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
i'm gonna actually try to play this

385
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
video

386
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,839
if not i will talk around what it says

387
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
hold on

388
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
this is the situation that happened this

389
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,000
was one of our passengers when me and

390
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
chris uh

391
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
had a chance to

392
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
go out in ukraine so we were at the

393
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,040
queue and uh we found out that the

394
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
security like the

395
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
the system the informatics system of uh

396
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,040
the border like went down so that's why

397
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,639
they took a break break in the night

398
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,560
because they didn't have x computers and

399
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
they couldn't verify documents for

400
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,959
people getting out of their country

401
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,519
and at that point uh chris who was uh

402
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
from what under the trees who was in

403
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
accounting ukraine to help them with uh

404
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,800
cyber attacks and all that that stuff uh

405
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,120
had the chance to go there and talk with

406
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
them and help them and guide them to

407
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,920
some directions and she was also working

408
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,639
as we speak on this as well

409
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,760
so

410
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
that's why we had a chance of me being

411
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
with chris there we had a chance to to

412
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
be practicing prioritized in front of

413
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
the queue and be able to crowd the

414
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
border in order for chris to be able to

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,639
help them further with what happened in

416
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,760
there with the cyber event

417
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
so it was very interesting because we

418
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
got to bypass about three or four days

419
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
of waiting in line at the border they

420
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,519
prioritize us because it seems that

421
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,759
i may or may not make fun of putin and

422
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
there may or may not have been some

423
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
various hit lists of people that they

424
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
were trying to find i know during our

425
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,000
journey we ran into wagner group twice

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
who tried to stop us and tried to shoot

427
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,160
at us

428
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
in south central ukraine

429
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
so this particular chap by the way very

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
interesting guy

431
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
as we were trying to evacuate kiev

432
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
we had a group of americans who panicked

433
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
with i swear to god it seemed like 10

434
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
large pieces of luggage they're like no

435
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
we're going to unload we'll find

436
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
something without speaking ukrainian and

437
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
they thought that they were going to

438
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,440
hail a

439
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
cab or something with 10 pieces of

440
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
luggage so in the meantime we found this

441
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
group of eight romanians who are like

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
what the hell is going on we were just

443
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
brought here for a business trip

444
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
and when we tried to call the company

445
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,320
they're like new phone who's this

446
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
right you're like

447
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,440
me

448
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
so we loaded them on and turns out he's

449
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
the most famous journalist in romania

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,480
so he also documented the whole thing

451
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,279
uh the microsoft ceo considers this now

452
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,560
the

453
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,279
border patrol attack the first instance

454
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,600
of a geneva convention violation using

455
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
digital means

456
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,040
but if you want to follow him he's on

457
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,880
instagram he's a really cool guy

458
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
now with this there are also other

459
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,959
things that went on

460
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,519
um no one including microsoft has a

461
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,000
position if this was on purpose

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,079
or just because it had been attached to

463
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,880
the border patrol so was it targeted or

464
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,439
not who knows one of the things it took

465
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,160
out was the entire orphan database and

466
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,439
children in the care system in ukraine

467
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,359
so suddenly hundreds of thousands of

468
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
children did not have any sort of

469
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
identification

470
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,679
now if you're trying to cross a border

471
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
and you might not have all the paperwork

472
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
or one of your neighbors kids or

473
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,160
whatever

474
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,480
how are you going to cross that border

475
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,679
uh

476
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,520
when they might not have id hey yeah

477
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
i'll take some of the kids from the

478
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
orphanage shove them in my car you get

479
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
to the border no sorry we suggest uh

480
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
suspect you might be child trafficking

481
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
because that happens during war

482
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,559
so what do you do

483
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,679
so a lot of kids could not get out

484
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,880
um

485
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
because of that

486
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
uh because i worked with several groups

487
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,559
who were trying to find care homes in

488
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,320
various countries for

489
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
uh regular orphaned kids and also

490
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
disabled orphan kids they could not get

491
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
out in time had to be turned around at

492
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,280
the border sometimes uh one particular

493
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
case they were we had over 50

494
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
cases

495
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,120
that had uh sheltered in the theater in

496
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,039
mario poll and even though there were

497
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,120
signs outside that said you know don't

498
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
don't kill us there's kids in here um

499
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
the russians destroyed that uh theater

500
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,360
and we lost most of those orphaned

501
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
children because they had not been able

502
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,440
to get out before due to a wiper virus

503
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,840
so another case

504
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,440
of this is what technology does

505
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
also the russians have been kidnapping

506
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,240
children there's over 200 kids who have

507
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,640
already been pushed over to russia

508
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
infiltration camps if they don't have

509
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
proper id how are they going to ever get

510
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,760
back

511
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
after this grim war ever ends

512
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,240
they're now stuck in russia for the rest

513
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
of their lives

514
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
so speaking of id

515
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,039
uh ukraine also has this uh great uh id

516
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,520
application called the daria system and

517
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,840
it sounds fantastic

518
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,679
except during more time

519
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,559
um so it'll store your id your tax

520
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,799
information your car registration your

521
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,440
vaccination status so forth

522
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
um so if you are like oh no i didn't

523
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
grab all of my stuff

524
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
because they shelled my neighbor's house

525
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
and mine caught on fire you thought hey

526
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,679
let's use this darya app well the

527
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,679
russians started messing with it and

528
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,280
there were times that the service was

529
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
completely unavailable

530
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,440
so you were hopeful that when he got up

531
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
to the border and if this was your only

532
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,919
stuff they could actually get through

533
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,919
because of some of these interruptions a

534
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
couple of the countries that boarded

535
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
with ukraine

536
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,840
one of which was romania one which was

537
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
moldova said if you don't have id we

538
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,600
understand just cross the border

539
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
which was very unusual

540
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
at the time

541
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
but with that the russians took a whole

542
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
bunch of personally identifiable

543
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,840
information as you can imagine privacy

544
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
does not exist during a war

545
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,799
just the way it is

546
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,280
so

547
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,720
um it's one of these situations where

548
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,080
what do you do

549
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,200
when you are trying to leave a war zone

550
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
or you think that uh there might be safe

551
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
areas i don't know if this map will work

552
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,919
but we'll try it so that shows you an

553
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,080
idea of some of the uh bombing and

554
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
timelines of attack

555
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
uh it's not the greatest one i could use

556
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
a different map let's just put it this

557
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,320
way all the little red dots and so forth

558
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,600
that are also

559
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,799
entering the center part are bombs

560
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,320
and shelling that russia has done

561
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,640
so even early on

562
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
you weren't safe in particular areas a

563
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,559
lot of people headed to the south

564
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
thinking they would be safe and then the

565
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,880
russians moved more towards the

566
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,440
southwest

567
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
so

568
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,520
one of these sayings like what do you do

569
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
crap

570
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
how many of you have ever studied abroad

571
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
have your children study abroad wanted

572
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
to study abroad

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,559
yeah quite a few you know it sounds like

574
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,000
a cool experience

575
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,679
so um

576
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
it was further complicated by the fact

577
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,039
that there were over 25 000

578
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,799
international students in ukraine when

579
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,320
the war started

580
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
the ukraine has been known for

581
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
generations now to be a low-cost

582
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,640
high-quality country to get

583
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
degrees and advanced degrees for the

584
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,600
global south

585
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
so that meant that there were a lot of

586
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,159
people from age 16 onward

587
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
studying to be doctors or lawyers or

588
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,280
maritime staff or computer science

589
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,840
who might not speak fluent ukrainian at

590
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
least not yet

591
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,559
who did not look like they were

592
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
ukrainians we're also stuck uh because

593
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
some of the major university areas

594
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
kirsten which you keep hearing about in

595
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
the news sumi which is almost directly

596
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
on the russian border

597
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
uh those places were so close to the

598
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,240
border they were taken over within hours

599
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,400
so

600
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,919
what do you do if you're also a foreign

601
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,159
national

602
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,919
and you've just gotten back to school

603
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,360
after covet

604
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
then you're like crap they're trying to

605
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
kill me

606
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,080
um so there were a lot of complications

607
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
with that as well

608
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,039
uh now there's a lot of ongoing stuff

609
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,280
that keeps occurring uh there's more and

610
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
more viper viruses

611
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
uh i like to say uh wipers are like

612
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,919
disco every few years they come back and

613
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,520
they become like a fashionable attack

614
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
tool

615
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
because this year is the 10th

616
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,400
anniversary of a massive wiper virus

617
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
the first massive wiper virus

618
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,039
ever used in such capacity the iranians

619
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,120
attacked saudi aramco

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,600
and almost destabilized destabilize the

621
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
global economy

622
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
there's a lot of surveillance wear

623
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
and you know that's kind of expected but

624
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
there's also a lot of uh dirty tricks

625
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,039
that are going on with it i'm sorry

626
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,520
i've got an interruption yeah

627
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,919
you made a speaker request

628
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,799
yes

629
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
now

630
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,679
unfortunately

631
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,799
these sides

632
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,200
cannot condone or promote any

633
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
expressions of violence of any kind but

634
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
i hope you asked for a picture of putin

635
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,559
under a ukrainian tractor

636
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,918
i have here for you a picture

637
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,359
[Music]

that's great

639
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,679
i have here for you a ukrainian tractor

640
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520

641
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
give it to you is up to you i have no

642
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
control

643
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
all right thank you so much

644
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,760
[Music]

645
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,000
um

646
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
so some of the things i've been working

647
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
on is working with quite a few

648
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
groups to help get people out especially

649
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,279
the most vulnerable folks

650
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,840
uh we had a situation of an elderly care

651
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,919
home where most people had alzheimer's

652
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
and dementia and the staff fled

653
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,000
so that could be your grandparents

654
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,559
you know think about that uh so things

655
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,960
were happening um so we've had cases

656
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
where russia has uh explicitly targeted

657
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
some of our groups

658
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,760
uh gotten on the communications

659
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
channel and go hey

660
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
so you're gonna go rescue a family

661
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,919
really let's kill the family before you

662
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,159
get there or let's pretend to be a

663
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,400
family and then kidnap you as an aid

664
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
worker and

665
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
charge 50 000 to get you back for a

666
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,919
ransom

667
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,480
uh or at the very least beat the living

668
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,400
crap out of you and leave you for debt

669
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
as an aid worker because we know where

670
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,120
you're going

671
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,600
because of surveillance where and most

672
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
ngos are like let's say people what is

673
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,000
cyber security let's say people those

674
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,919
are the hard you know choices you have

675
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,520
to make

676
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,480
um

677
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
so those who have had

678
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,919
uh contact on uh ukrainian telecoms a

679
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,279
lot of them including myself were

680
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,400
rerouted back to ukraine and into russia

681
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
uh just on our uh mobile phones even

682
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,120
though we were in the rest of europe uh

683
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
there have been cases where refugees who

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
have been public about their stories

685
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,600
have gotten bombarded

686
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,279
with pictures such as hacked away bodies

687
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,080
corpses set on fire

688
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
yay fantastic then there's been a lot of

689
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
disinformation misinformation mal

690
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,640
information and propaganda going on

691
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,120
especially in the former soviet states

692
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,600
nato countries have been attacked cyber

693
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
attacked

694
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
over and over again some countries have

695
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,200
had to shut off geographic access

696
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
outside of their country like albania

697
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,720
romania and parts of moldovan government

698
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,080
as well

699
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,158
so a lot of shiznits still going on

700
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,360
unfortunately things keep getting worse

701
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
uh we now have a series of uh because

702
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,480
russia seems to love to

703
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,799
rig nuclear power plants with explosives

704
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,679
or shoot at it

705
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,600
but also

706
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,679
what are they doing if they've now

707
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
completely gone bonkers for a scorch and

708
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,559
burn policy what are they going to do on

709
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
the cyber front not just ukraine but to

710
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
other supporting countries listed on

711
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,679
their unfriendly list we are now

712
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,240
unfriendly i'm a friendly person unless

713
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
you're putin remember step on putin

714
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,400
um so

715
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
they put in some references but you can

716
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,919
easily search i don't want to put too

717
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,919
many references on

718
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
um i left time for questions

719
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,960
try to keep them short no word

720
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,159
statements like the board doesn't exist

721
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,600
um yes it does

722
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,559
uh

723
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,159
so uh no political statements

724
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,840
and so i'll leave this up

725
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,960
at the end

726
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,320

there so if you don't mind popping up if

736

you step on putin everybody who has the

737
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,520
questions come here up on putin

738
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
i deal with a lot of the um

739
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,720
the

740
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
rushy

741
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,320
so i'm a threat analyst at netskope um i

742
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,919
do a lot of um analysis on uh question

743
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
malware and what comes in and the point

744
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,039
i've been really trying to prove um is

745
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
that i i genuinely believe that cyber is

746
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
the next aspect of war

747
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
um and i wanted to ask you if that's

748
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
something that you believe as well if um

749
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
specifically location

750
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,880
uh

751
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
um if you believe that there's a

752
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
correlation between where the malware is

753
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
hitting and where the kinetic attacks

754
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,799
are going to come

755
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,200
does that make sense yeah

756
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,159
so

757
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,600
is there a relationship between the

758
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,440
kinetic attacks and cyber attacks to a

759
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
certain extent absolutely as for example

760
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,440
we saw early on in the war that

761
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
russia had

762
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,480
tried to take out the satellite

763
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,760
communications and zielinski's

764
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
comms but also satellite phones

765
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,120
unfortunately

766
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,080
as we all know oh people network segment

767
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
and there's this thing called air gap

768
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,399
wasn't true took out the french space

769
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,399
programs communications a bunch of

770
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,480
maritime communications because they

771
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,080
didn't really satellite phone

772
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,799
communications yeah you know whatever

773
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,720
so um

774
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
so before that attack uh then they

775
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,279
started another shelling campaign hoping

776
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,960
to be undercover but that was not the

777
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
case

778
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,919
so there is a relationship between the

779
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,559
two there seems to be a preparation

780
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,120
uh with cyber and then physical

781
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
something

782
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,559
next question

783
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,279
pop on up

784
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,660
[Music]

785
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,520
so so one of the questions i have is

786
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,480
you mentioned that there are no

787
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
coincidences in war makes total sense

788
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
what were some of the rumblings some of

789
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,720
the things that happened beforehand

790
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,279
that you know you maybe became aware of

791
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,360
or that maybe we can watch for because

792
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,199
if russia's not done russia's not done

793
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,760
well so there were some oddities

794
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,600
uh such as

795
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
when they started switching their

796
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,480
handheld radio system so it was alerted

797
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,320
uh and that was

798
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
i don't know six hours before they

799
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
started shelling the capital uh there

800
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,480
were a few oddities and also um

801
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
watching

802
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
uh the mean generation coming out of

803
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,720
certain countries that were going to be

804
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
more pro-russian

805
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,039
started kicking off uh so it was like in

806
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,520
preparation for uh so there are certain

807
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
things you know they want to win the

808
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,799
hearts and minds as well as shoot

809
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,200
anybody that doesn't agree with them so

810
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
you know to do that there has to be a

811
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,279
process beforehand

812
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,760
and then coinciding with it as well

813
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,559
so yes there are certain precursors i

814
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,320
have more time for questions

815
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,279
putin still needs

816
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,760
feet footprints

817
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,440
come come on over here don't pee cause

818
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
somebody will have to clean it up

819
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,640
don't be ambassador

820
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,158
let's be closer to the mic

821
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,159
yeah i'm not gonna trip all day all

822
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,080
right um so

823
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
uh i was paying attention to the

824
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
build-up of the war

825
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,880
and

826
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,279
even in january the analysts that i was

827
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
reading

828
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,080
basically had the start date of the war

829
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
within a 48-hour window they're like

830
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
he's gonna wait till after the olympics

831
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,240
it's gonna be right in here

832
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,320
how much of that do are you aware was

833
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,559
ukrainian intelligence and how much of

834
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
that was just the entire international

835
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,080
community

836
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,960
you know

837
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,480
putting all their resources together to

838
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,880
nail this down

839
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
okay so as the war started building up

840
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,919
there were lots of people who said hey

841
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,279
it's going to be on this date or that

842
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,760
date or whatever which was a good move

843
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,120
on russia's part because they're like

844
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,480
hey those are the days we're definitely

845
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
not going to attack

846
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,679
um

847
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,600
we're going to make them spin up get all

848
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
their their people tired when you have

849
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,760
to do these things

850
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
get kind of fatigued also

851
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,360
it allowed for the ukrainians themselves

852
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,279
to go man this is always in the news

853
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,200
maybe they're right about media not

854
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,559
being the greatest because the

855
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,320
westerners keep saying there's a war and

856
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,159
there's no war yet

857
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,799
so complaints complacency

858
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,640
um

859
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,519
but uh at the same time

860
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,440
some people don't understand

861
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,799
putin really likes numerology

862
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,880
so when the first russian troops started

863
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
going through the east

864
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,799
stepping over that border which was on

865
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
22nd

866
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,559
of february

867
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,480
2022

868
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,559
he loves doing things like that

869
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
uh look at when they started moving into

870
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,120
georgia yeah it's great um so that's

871
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,240
when the big first big escalation

872
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,919
occurred

873
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,279
um

874
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,880
so yeah

875
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
there were a lot of things said

876
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,320
but you see

877
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,679
they didn't think about numerology

878
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,080
and all the yes men

879
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
uh and a few other things when the war

880
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,480
started

881
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,279
so

882
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
i don't know hope that answers it i

883
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,000
still have time for more questions

884
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
putin loves to be stomped on

885
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
come on up

886
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,799
i mean

887
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,360
he he also likes other things like big

888
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,130
burly men put no shirt on

889
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,399
[Music]

890
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,799
um one of the questions i have is the

891
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,600
relationship between putin utilizing we

892
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
see the use of hacktivism but also the

893
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,679
engagement of the ransomware gangs and

894
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,159
to what extent did you see that being

895
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
used and how would that carry forward

896
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
so fun fact

897
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,519
about two years ago russia

898
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,080
decriminalized

899
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,000
basically any hacking that occurs in

900
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,679
russia as long as it's outbound and it

901
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,120
does not affect russian

902
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,480
entities

903
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,559
yay

904
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,600
so

905
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
this has been going on for a while i

906
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,559
mean if you're cut

907
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
i'm gonna hiccup if your country's at

908
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,840
war why wouldn't you use

909
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,640
hackers

910
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
um also if you want to get a lot of

911
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,440
people involved on your side

912
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,280
who are hackers

913
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,679
are not going to use a lot of exotic

914
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,520
tools it's going to take too long it's

915
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,320
going to cost too much but ransomware

916
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,280
yeah you just gotta tweak a few things

917
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,800
you don't have to get the money you just

918
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
have to destroy

919
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,879
um so yeah

920
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,199
yeah i think uh more and more this is

921
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,719
going to occur

922
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,560
and uh you know

923
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
the 2020 suck

924
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,839
so yeah there you go

925
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,119
come on up

926
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,879
you're easier to come up this way don't

927
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
trip on your way back

928
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,719
please for the love of god

929
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,520
um given your global experience i'm

930
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,480
curious what the level of sophistication

931
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
from the russians is they obviously seem

932
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,280
very motivated but how technically savvy

933
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,520
are they

934
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,200
they are not very technically savvy um

935
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,680
and they also

936
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,560
don't necessarily understand

937
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,800
ukrainian culture

938
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,280
or the language necessarily

939
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
because there's been a lot of very weird

940
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
attacks was it last week i think was

941
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
last week

942
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
so tired from jet lag maybe this week

943
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,000
before i was at mch 2022 and we had a

944
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
panel uh on some of the things that were

945
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
going on in ukraine with one of the

946
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,920
panelists remote dialing in from ukraine

947
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,760
and so she went through uh some

948
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
instances where there was a spin on a

949
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,200
government entity name uh for a website

950
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,480
that nothing to do with the government

951
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,880
entity and because that's more like a

952
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,119
colloquialism for ukrainian

953
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
uh they were attacking those instead of

954
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,560
some of the actual government websites

955
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,960
um so in her opinion most of stuff that

956
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,800
they've seen is not very sophisticated

957
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,920
so time for some questions

958
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,359
i've got one up here and we'll start

959
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,040
getting you lined up come on no no keep

960
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,839
just don't trip

961
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,920
hold

962
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
so i guess my question does a follow-on

963
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,960
uh from the previous question which is

964
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,760
if

965
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
russia's not particularly sophisticated

966
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,599
was it that the ukrainian infrastructure

967
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
wasn't well designed or

968
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,480
oh

969
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,520
i have to ask the question because

970
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,680
yeah

971
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,640
yeah who thinks that the us government

972
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,680
the pentacle of cyber security

973
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,400
is prepared to go to war right now with

974
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,880
its infrastructure

975
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
for the record nobody raised their hand

976
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,280
uh so before the war there was already a

977
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320
struggle

978
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,160
and people just accepted that cyber

979
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,320
attacks would happen like when you know

980
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
the atm machines weren't working they're

981
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,480
like oh that's just another cyber attack

982
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,240
from russia we might not have

983
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,520
electricity soon oh well russia

984
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,320
um because it's been expected but at the

985
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
same time ukraine was not a wealthy

986
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,079
country well unless you're an oligarch

987
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,680
that's a different story

988
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
um so they didn't have top of the line

989
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,560
stuff it was hard to

990
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
keep uh experts in the country when the

991
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,560
rate of pay retirement is 300 us dollars

992
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
awesome so if that gives you an idea of

993
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,880
their pay range how do you retain those

994
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,760
people

995
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
and then oh yeah we've been at war since

996
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,200
2014 with the russians um

997
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
so they were in a very unique position

998
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,400
um

999
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,880
they were perhaps a bit more vulnerable

1000
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,240
than the us but perhaps not

1001
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,200
[Music]

1002
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,880
so yeah

1003
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,680
it was a quagmire before the war

1004
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,720
luckily

1005
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,800
they understand crisis and were able to

1006
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,880
get a lot of things spun up and changed

1007
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
over during the war

1008
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,280
all right next question

1009
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,599
so late in 2021

1010
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,119
they were starting to clone they were

1011
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,560
starting to clone the government

1012
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,400
websites of ukraine

1013
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,160
how effective do you think that was with

1014
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,640
this uh with the

1015
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,720
spread of malware and disinformation

1016
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,800
campaigns early on

1017
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,079
wow

1018
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,800
i think that they were

1019
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,960
weirdly successful in some ways with

1020
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
some of the cloned web sub sites for

1021
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,040
people who didn't know any better

1022
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
um

1023
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
but you know you always get those people

1024
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,119
it's a nigerian print scam almost like

1025
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,800
if you're gonna believe this with all

1026
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,320
the misspellings we can get you for

1027
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
money it's a test

1028
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,680
um

1029
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,079
so they did do a pretty good job with

1030
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,160
some of the propaganda

1031
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
and all the misinformation and all that

1032
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,839
kind of stuff so they were geared up and

1033
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,800
ready

1034
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,599
especially with former uh soviet states

1035
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,520
near the border i remember by the time

1036
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,560
we arrived in bucharest i was punched my

1037
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,800
hotel clerk because

1038
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,040
i was going around on facebook

1039
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,720
that only the wealthy ukrainians got out

1040
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,880
uh and why on earth are romanians

1041
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
helping all these wealthy ukrainians

1042
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,960
when we have so much poverty here and

1043
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
she repeated that to me and i'm like

1044
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,240
dude are you

1045
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,200
i'm serious uh you know i'm with the

1046
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
family with two kids and they got two

1047
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,119
bags

1048
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,400
that's all they own now but it was

1049
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
prepped on different types of social

1050
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,599
media

1051
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,400
uh with some of this negative sentiment

1052
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,800
uh so in a way

1053
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,560
it was successful

1054
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
in a way like when they made this deep

1055
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
fake of zilinski surrendering to russia

1056
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,760
people just laughed their ass off so

1057
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,240
in other ways

1058
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,480
they were not winning but they do a damn

1059
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
good job

1060
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,920
um i have room

1061
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,839
let's

1062
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,640
see

1063
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,800
okay okay

1064
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,440
seven minutes

1065
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
it's either that or you will listen to

1066
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,759
me sing capella

1067
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,680
it's always nice to step on foot in

1068
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,800
right yeah

1069
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,599
uh so what do you think we as an

1070
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,000
industry can learn and do we need to

1071
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
prepare for russia in the

1072
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,118
following months

1073
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,720
and also

1074
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
yeah you all touched on on it already do

1075
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,520
you think russians will start ransom

1076
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,040
destroying

1077
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,839
nato countries

1078
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,000
the the time to prepare

1079
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,839
was last year but now we have a war

1080
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,800
where all sorts of stuff is hitting neo

1081
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,040
nato does not want to enter the war so

1082
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,240
they're like oh

1083
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,079
go ahead and take our our space

1084
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,240
satellite communications down

1085
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,480
go ahead and you know hit all sorts of

1086
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
banking stuff in finland sure we're not

1087
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,200
gonna physically go in this war

1088
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,240
um

1089
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
so there there's a lot of stuff uh

1090
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,079
that's going on and it's uh

1091
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,599
heating up

1092
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,560
um do i think that they'll restore stuff

1093
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,000
well let's see

1094
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
um how many of you knew that costa rica

1095
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
for about a month was held

1096
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,520
uh

1097
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,400
yeah it was helped by ransomware from

1098
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,960
russians who wanted 50 million to allow

1099
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,839
them to take in tax revenue again in

1100
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,839
some of their medical system so i saw

1101
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,599
about five people

1102
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,000
uh the uh costa rica is a protectorate

1103
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,480
of the us they don't have a military

1104
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
um

1105
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,040
and so just being a protectorate

1106
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,280
has entered them into the war

1107
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,040
awesome not awesome

1108
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,359
another place that russia is hitting

1109
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,599
is in your supply chain for those small

1110
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,760
to medium-sized businesses

1111
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,599
where it's crucial that your business

1112
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,760
stays up because you're a unique vendor

1113
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,680
but oh by the way you probably don't

1114
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
have great cyber security or do loads of

1115
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,079
testing or can afford external pen tests

1116
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,400
and a fancy deloitte consultant will

1117
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,079
charge you eighty thousand just to shake

1118
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,200
your hand

1119
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,920
uh so um those are some of the areas

1120
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,079
that really need to prepare

1121
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,680
and i wish they had better grants and

1122
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
easier grants for small to medium-sized

1123
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,119
businesses that need to up their

1124
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,720
security

1125
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,839
so

1126
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,839
i have time for like one to two more

1127
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,920
questions

1128
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,680
you can also just come up and step on

1129
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,720
putin

1130
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,118
i don't mind

1131
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
can you help us understand the

1132
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,560
difference in dmvp like can you help us

1133
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,440
understand the difference with uh dmvp

1134
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
as in what each one of those means

1135
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,760
oh sure

1136
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,800
so

1137
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,119
because the industry loves fancy

1138
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,960
acronyms dm mp i had to remember what it

1139
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,000
was yesterday because sometimes i forget

1140
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
disinformation

1141
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,839
misinformation

1142
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,040
mal information and propaganda

1143
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
there's some some subtle but interesting

1144
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,000
differences

1145
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
uh

1146
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,760
so propaganda might be to try to get you

1147
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,079
to support certain things

1148
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
uh nowadays there's a

1149
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,040
fake but realistic-looking media

1150
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,920
websites that'll uh actually advertise

1151
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,119
some of this

1152
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,680
uh various not so great uh truthful

1153
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,119
information

1154
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,119
and uh set up propaganda as a whole

1155
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,760
now with that misinformation

1156
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,200
tries to divert you

1157
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,880
disinformation will try to have

1158
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,599
a sliver of truth to make it believable

1159
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,000
mal information is just malicious as

1160
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,119


1161
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,599
um like we've had some instances of

1162
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,760
people working for aid organizations

1163
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,920
trying to get people out of ukraine

1164
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
and suddenly they've been slandered as

1165
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,440
child pedophiles with fake

1166
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,160
mug shots put up on facebook and once a

1167
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,240
malicious rumor gets started

1168
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,319
you're you're hosed how do you get rid

1169
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,160
of that right

1170
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,599
um

1171
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,599
so we've seen a lot of this

1172
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,599
go on and it's still continuing

1173
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,560
yeah

1174
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,040
so it's uh it's very unfortunate um i

1175
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,920
wish the u.s uh had not closed their

1176
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,960
their office of anti-propaganda during

1177
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,400
the bush senior

1178
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,599
um

1179
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,960
presidency because they didn't think it

1180
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,839
was important

1181
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,119
don't um so yeah so there you go i have

1182
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
three minutes

1183
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,560
uh given your experience with russia how

1184
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,800
do you extrapolate that with china

1185
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,400
taiwan and

1186
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
those other situations where we might

1187
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,839
not be able to dance around it and avoid

1188
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,640
it like nato has with russia

1189
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,560
yeah so i think

1190
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
most of us believe that china's been

1191
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,079
checking out going hey

1192
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,920
how's russia being treated they can

1193
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,640
still go get around stuff oh

1194
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,400
when can i get taiwan in my grubby

1195
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,600

00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,800
[Music]

1197
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,760
um

1198
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,119
so

1199
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,640
some countries have been watching taiwan

1200
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,480
very closely

1201
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,880
uh also looking at how you can

1202
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
destabilize things early on before you

1203
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
actually have physical troops i mean you

1204
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,319
know why not if i was an evil dictator i

1205
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,079
would do the same thing

1206
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,839
i'm also looking for a job as an evil

1207
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,400
dictator

1208
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
i'm just saying i'd be very good at it

1209
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,920

1210
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,160

1211
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,920
swords are rattling

1212
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,000

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,680

1218
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
