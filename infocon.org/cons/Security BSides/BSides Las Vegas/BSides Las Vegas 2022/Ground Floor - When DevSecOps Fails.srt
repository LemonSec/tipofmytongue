thank you

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,559
um so

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,360
i uh i have a weird career and i do a

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,960
lot of consulting with different really

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
big companies like companies that you

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
know the names of

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
and then i also my company was bought

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,320
earlier this year by the nice folks at

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
bright security so i work for them but

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,439
as a result of all my weird consulting

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,080
i've seen a lot of companies do stuff

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
and not all of them went well and so

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
over the past couple years since i've

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
been doing devops and dev tech up sorts

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
of things

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,759
there's like a trend of crap that goes

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,040
wrong

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,799
and so i have noticed quite a bit of

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,119
this um so we're like we're gonna do

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,520
devsecops and then it feels like this

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
for the dev team

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
um stuff like the security team's like

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,880
cool we bought a sas and a desk and an

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,200
sca and we got a secret scanner and then

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,799
we bought this like weird startup thing

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,079
we did that and then we put it all in

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,520
the pipeline and then the pipeline ran

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,000
10 hours instead of 10 minutes and no

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,479
one wants to hang out with us anymore

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,719
and so i at first was rang this talk and

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
then i i was like when devsecops fails

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
and so i want to talk about how we can

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,038
avoid those common mistakes and the

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,239
thing i wanted to tell you at the

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
beginning of the talk to try to help you

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
pay slightly more attention is that i

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
brought what i like to call the maple

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
secrets from canada so in canada we have

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
these things called maple trees and they

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,080
leak candy i kid you not their syrup is

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
sweet and delicious and delightful and

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
we make candy out of it and i brought

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,959
candies so if you ask a question after

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,640
i'm gonna give you a candy all the way

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,920
from canada

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
and everyone gets stickers because

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
that's how i am

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
okay so i uh so uh who so what is

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
devsecops so this is what this talk is

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
about so if you're like devops software

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
development that's the worst you might

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
not want to be here so

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
what the heck is this it's like what is

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
tony going to talk about

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,440
so we used to make software a zillion

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
years ago doing waterfowl

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
and i mispronounce it because sometimes

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
i say water fail

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
but basically waterfall

84
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
at first was good because it was way

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
better than no methodology for building

86
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
software but we realized quickly about

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
70 of projects failed i don't know if

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,440
you know that

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,959
um so i went i went to college in the

90
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
90s and like yeah it didn't go that well

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
um so then agile like really smart

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
people came up with this agile saying

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and it's like instead of waiting two

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
years to ask if people liked what we

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
made what if we asked regularly

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,480
what if we met every day to like see how

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
things are going on and so that improved

98
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,959
a lot but then devops happened

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,879
and the idea of devops

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
i'll get into it more in a bit but

101
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
devops is not only a methodology for

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
building software it's a complete

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
culture change and so if you're like we

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
got a ci cd

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,239
and we run it sometimes you're not doing

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
all of devops you're doing part of

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
devops and that's still cool and that's

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
way better than doing none

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,599
but there's so much more you could have

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,879
and so

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,319
lots and lots of developers have been

112
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,920
very excited about this for a while the

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
moment i heard of it i was like this is

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
the best

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
um and then eventually security folks

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
are like why are the devops people

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,400
breaking stuff

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
why don't they stop for my nice gates

119
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
that i made for them

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,120
they want to release eight times a day

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,959
and i only have time to review code once

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,238
a year

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,160
and so we had to as security folks kind

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,199
of like

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
get get the net we had to like

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
kind of catch up and see what they're

127
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
doing and so then i start getting a lot

128
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
of consulting calls about like how can

129
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,600
we do this better how can we not piss

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
everyone off constantly but still get

131
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
things to be more secure and so i i just

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
started having clients say just tell us

133
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
what goes wrong

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
so that we can like work on that stuff

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
from the beginning like we don't because

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,800
a lot of teams that they misstep at the

137
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,479
beginning and they lose a lot of trust

138
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,720
in the process so i'm hoping we could go

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
over these and then after we could have

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
questions and then maybe at 9 00 p.m

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
tonight some of you want to sing karaoke

142
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
with me but you don't have to you can

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
just watch okay so who am i i am a giant

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
nerd this is the mandatory about me

145
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
slide um so i work at bright security we

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
make a dynamic scanner and i am in

147
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,280
charge of developer relations which

148
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
means i get to talk at conferences all

149
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
the time and they pay it's the best

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
i founded my own non-profit or my own it

151
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,919
is for it was for profit just to be

152
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,280
clear

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,639
if you don't make profits you're

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
non-nonprofit i don't know if you know

155
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,759
that but anyway i founded this online um

brush my hair i look pretty good

168
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
okay so yay devops so i love devops i'm

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
really excited and so security folks

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
we've been like trying for quite a while

171
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
to like get people on board the security

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
train especially software developers and

173
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400
so

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
we did we did not have good luck at this

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
at first so like i don't know about you

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,560
but when i was a software developer when

177
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
the security team started talking to me

178
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
i'm like why are they bothering me and

179
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,840
getting in the way of my deadlines that

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
was my opinion as a dev

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,039
um and so

182
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,000
devsecops became a cool new look so

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
who's seen this slide this is a very

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
famous slide by a dude named pete

185
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
schlezlock who's very smart

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,639
and he was like this is how some

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
security people see devops

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,199
uh they're like you know they're magical

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
and amazing and they move fast and they

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
break stuff and us security folks are

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
left cleaning up their

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,680
as my friend nancy calls it rainbow poo

193
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,160
um but yay marketing let's call it

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
devsecops instead

195
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
and then it'll be cooler and then people

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
will do it and so

197
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,680
this is this is the way that i view

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
so they're still breaking things

199
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
sometimes they're still moving quite

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,479
fast and sometimes it doesn't work out

201
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,759
but we're trying to train them we're

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,960
trying to give them tools we're trying

203
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
to help them we're trying to like keep

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,400
them on the track so they get there

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,759
successfully

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
and we've learned that if devs do their

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,639
works in sprints we should try to do our

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
work in sprints if they're using a ci cd

209
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
some of my stuff should be in that ci cd

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,039
i should not just close my eyes and

211
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
pretend it's not happening because i'm

212
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
not going to get a good result so

213
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,400
marketing basically got involved and

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,680
we're like yay um but so then vendors

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
got involved and like we're at a

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
community event that we would not be

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
able to afford to be at if it weren't

218
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,720
for nice vendors that sponsored it and

219
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
so i work for a vendor now i'm vendor

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
scum i think i'm making a t-shirt that

221
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
said that but anyway i digress

222
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
um but so

223
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
devsecops made a lot of promises

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,440
so like promises that life would be like

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,520
this we would all feel like this all the

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
time but really it felt like

227
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,280
like what i saw with some products

228
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
because i've played with a lot of

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
products i saw this so this is the

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
system development lifecycle so

231
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
requirements would happen no security

232
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
folks complete silence design security

233
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,919
folks know where to be found code

234
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,520
security people totally ignoring them

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
doing their own thing and then they're

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
like oh it's test let's run five tools

237
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
on full blast in the pipeline and see

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,080
what happens

239
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
um let's have tons of false positives

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
and break the build all the time let's

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
break every build no

242
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
uh and then security being like you guys

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,599
suck

244
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,599
uh and then the devs being like i don't

245
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,200
like the security team anymore that i've

246
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,919
seen this cycle a lot unfortunately and

247
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
i know it seems pessimistic but i wants

248
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
to avoid this so vendors promise life

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,120
would be perfect but they left out a few

250
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
details and like this kitty's like i

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
thought this was business class

252
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
um so i want to talk about how we can

253
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
avoid failure how we can like look like

254
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,279
we're really smart and we've done this

255
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
for a zillion years even if we're new

256
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,480
and if you've been doing this for a

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,920
zillion years maybe you're gonna learn

258
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,839
something that you could do even better

259
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,920
so that is the point of this talk

260
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,279
and i'm just checking my time because i

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,880
talk a lot i'm so good okay so

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
the first thing i see a lot is failing

263
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
builds for the wrong reasons i talked to

264
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,480
so many security folks they're like i

265
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
can't wait to start breaking builds

266
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,279
that's a little bit like saying i can't

267
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
wait to break their dreams

268
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,800
like when you're a dev so who here has

269
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
written software before in their life

270
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
okay how many of you have pushed code

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,560
through a ci cd and you're full of

272
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
optimism and happiness and you're like

273
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
i'm gonna make it to prod it's gonna be

274
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
that day yeah

275
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
finding out the security folks can't

276
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
wait to fail your builds feels bad

277
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
like when you push to the ci cd you're

278
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
like i'm gonna run a bunch of tests but

279
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
you're not like this is crappy and i'm

280
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
gonna send it you've like done a little

281
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
testing yourself you're like i think

282
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
this is pretty good let's run some

283
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,560
checks okay

284
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
today like i think i'm gonna get there

285
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
so if we're planning to fail the builds

286
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
just from the start like this is not

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
good so i want to go over good reasons

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,920
to build to fail a build so

289
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
yes false positives really suck um okay

290
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
so the first one

291
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,800
if you need gates

292
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,399
in order to get security done because a

293
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,200
lot of people are like i need dev gates

294
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
it needs to be part of a formal approval

295
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,800
process

296
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
it's not security professionals who are

297
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,640
using breaking builds to get your way

298
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
like it's not like i'm gonna break their

299
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
bill to teach them a lesson i've heard

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,040
that

301
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
like i've literally heard that from

302
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
adults

303
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,399
i

304
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,160
i walked in on these two guys once in

305
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
the hallway

306
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,000
where i had joined a team to do absec

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,680
and then i quickly left and worked

308
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,200
somewhere else and they were making

309
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
faces at each other like

310
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,279
and then they would laugh and the other

311
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
one make a face and they laugh and i was

312
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,040
like what's going on and they're like

313
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
we're making faces we're practicing our

314
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
your stupid face and i'm like

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
what is this for and they're like it's

316
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
so when devs ask questions in meetings

317
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,959
we can make them know how stupid they

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,240
are

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,440
and i was like i can't work on this team

320
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
i do not belong here this is wrong

321
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
and so

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
we don't want to break fields we do it

323
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
if we have to okay so the next one is

324
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,279
the pipeline should not be the first

325
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,120
time we look at security

326
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
like that shouldn't be our first thing

327
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
that we ever do like if they're if

328
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
they're spending time gathering

329
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,959
requirements about what they're going to

330
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,399
build i want to be a part of those

331
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,680
requirements

332
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
i i want to have a requirement that's

333
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
like we're going to do this type of scam

334
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
ps here's your license if you want to

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
run it first so you always pass

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
like here's how i want you to build it

337
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,000
securely etc in the design phase threat

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
modeling like this shouldn't be the

339
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
first time and we're going to talk a bit

340
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
more about that in like a few minutes in

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
this talk so the next one is

342
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
test the accuracy of your tools for a

343
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
long time before you break builds so i

344
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
put a tool in the pipeline

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
if i just have it set to give me data

346
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
and alert

347
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,639
i don't have it

348
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
so it breaks the build immediately

349
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,399
because who here has ever gotten a false

350
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
positive ever on a product okay all of

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,399
you are lying

352
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
or your arms are very heavy because like

353
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
the first couple of tools i put in i was

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
just like no but it told me there's this

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
wrong and then it's it's not wrong i

356
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,839
don't know what to do

357
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,680
and so it i think it's important to put

358
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
it in make sure you've got it going as

359
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
fast as it can go you're like doing all

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
of the things

361
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
and it seems to be going well they've

362
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
fixed the backlog of security problems

363
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
that were already there then i turn on

364
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
breaking builds and it's for high things

365
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,399
and we see if they can start getting to

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
prod with that in place cool then maybe

367
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
we move on to mediums but most places i

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,279
go to work

369
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
they have like thousands of critical

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,079
bugs that no one's fixing and running

371
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,200
around breaking builds isn't going to

372
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
fix that right and so if i can alert

373
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,360
them as to the problem

374
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
and then eventually they start fixing

375
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,639
things they start getting better then

376
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
eventually i can start breaking builds

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,399
so another one is you can't if you can't

378
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,200
get accurate results with your tool

379
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,560
that's okay

380
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
do the testing outside the pipeline so i

381
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,839
don't know maybe some of you have bought

382
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
a sass

383
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
and not all sas are like this and people

384
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
that make sass will be upset i'm going

385
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
to say this but some of them give a ton

386
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
of false positives like 90

387
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
like you said it to be very sensitive

388
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
and it tells you everything that could

389
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,040
possibly be a vulnerability and you're

390
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
like

391
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
this does not belong on the pipeline it

392
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,880
just doesn't

393
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,959
we can't break a build all the time with

394
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,720
those positives because we're breaking

395
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,440
everyone's trust in us so that doesn't

396
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,880
mean you don't use your tool so let's

397
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
say you bought a tool and it and it's

398
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,120
from a super awesome company and you

399
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,040
bought it for three years so you have to

400
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
keep using this tool no one's going to

401
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
give you another couple hundred k per

402
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,760
year to buy another tool

403
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
so you're like i'm stuck with this tool

404
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,800
that's fine but do the test outside the

405
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
pipeline or only do a few tests on the

406
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
pipeline and then run like your big huge

407
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
long 18 hour saskian outside the

408
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,519
pipeline you could still have friends

409
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,199
this is important

410
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,600
okay so the next one is use out of band

411
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
tests

412
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,959
um so this means like

413
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,279
sorry i i like saw the next slide and

414
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
was like what what am i talking about um

415
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
so use out of band tests so what you can

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
do is you can run a test overnight

417
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,199
take those results

418
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
um so my friend that works at a big

419
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,320
company that makes really awesome

420
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
athletic shoes so you've heard of them

421
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,800
they took all the stuff out of their

422
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
pipeline

423
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,079
and what they did was is they ran it all

424
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
outside the pipeline every day

425
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
and then they send pass or fail based on

426
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,600
their policy to an api and so every time

427
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
the build is run it just checks the

428
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,279
security api and it's like pass or fail

429
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
yo and if you pass you go to prawn if

430
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
you fail you already received an email

431
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,680
telling you how bad you are you already

432
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,639
knew

433
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,639
um and so that worked for them and they

434
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,560
went from an hour and a half long

435
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,399
pipeline to a seven minute pipeline and

436
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,639
everyone was like yes

437
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,800
okay so another thing is consider if you

438
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
need your security to be perfect

439
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,320
or just good

440
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
most of us just need good a lot of

441
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,560
places i consult they have like i said

442
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
thousands of criticals thousands of

443
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,800
highs an absolutely insane number of

444
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,000
mediums

445
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,360
and then they'll get a tool and they're

446
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,639
like well it's got to be perfect and

447
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
find every single possible low i'm like

448
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,399
really wise you could just ignore them

449
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
and never

450
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
you're never going to fix the lows let's

451
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
like you're you're begging to have one

452
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
critical fixed a week so it doesn't make

453
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
sense for us to spend 10 times longer

454
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
scanning to try to find those low

455
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
vulnerabilities when instead we could

456
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,680
have a scan that runs in like one tenth

457
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
of the time and yeah it's gonna miss

458
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,800
some stuff

459
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
but it's gonna be good

460
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
and so a lot of companies i'm like do

461
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
you need to be perfect like did you make

462
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
the covid vaccine

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
are you doing anti-terrorism activities

464
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,519
that are top secret

465
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,639
are you

466
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,240
amazon marketplace

467
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,519
well then you probably could just be

468
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
good most of us just need to be good we

469
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,480
don't need to be perfect and so

470
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
if you can be realistic with that you

471
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
could choose a completely different tool

472
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
set and save tons of time

473
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
oh sorry i'll put that back for you

474
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
okay um so then the last one i want to

475
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,759
say is celebrate success when people get

476
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,199
through the pipeline for the first time

477
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,360
and they had to fix 400 things to do it

478
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
tell them how awesome they are

479
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
this is a thing a security team forgets

480
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
we forget to say good job where usually

481
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,920
they're like you made a mistake

482
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
you're terrible let me tell you how

483
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
terrible

484
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
what if we were like hey this team made

485
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
it through the pipeline the first time

486
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
let's give them a shout out it sounds

487
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
crazy but

488
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
i've done it okay so this is the picture

489
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,000
slide so if you wanted to take a picture

490
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
of all the points i just made you would

491
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
take a picture of this slide with your

492
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
phone you don't have to but you can if

493
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,120
you want and there's going to be a few

494
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,399
more of these

495
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
and i do these because i hate taking

496
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
notes but i really want to have notes

497
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,399
so it's like it's a heart it's a

498
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,920
conflict right

499
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
okay so i think most of the people's

500
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,199
cameras are down i'm just going to give

501
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,480
you one more second but you got to be

502
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
like faster for the next slide just

503
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,680
kidding i don't really have anywhere

504
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,000
else to be um okay

505
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
next so then also i have the unicorn

506
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
i spoke at grim con this year and that's

507
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
their logo and i just love it okay so

508
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,600
slow tools so this is a thing i see a

509
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
lot of

510
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
so so i work at a startup and then we

511
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
made a really fast tool

512
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
but some of the original tools are like

513
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
not fast i would call them not fast and

514
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,000
so i want to talk about how we can go

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,199
faster

516
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
so the first time i had someone run a

517
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,400
static application security testing tool

518
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
on the app i was leading the team to

519
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,919
build it took 18 hours to run and that's

520
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,559
not fast at all that actually really

521
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
sucks um so

522
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
so i'm just gonna show you fancy cars i

523
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,799
don't know if you like cars but they're

524
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,080
very fancy

525
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,039
um

526
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,160
so

527
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,840
you can perform as much testing as

528
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,919
possible before you go

529
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,160
to the ci cd so like as soon as someone

530
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
checks in code you can run automated

531
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,360
tests while the dev is deving i know

532
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
it's not word um you can actually give

533
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
them an ide plugin so they can test

534
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
things themselves they can push things

535
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
to their dev server and if you are an

536
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
open-minded security team you could give

537
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
them a tool they could be like pew pew

538
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,160
pew pew and they could find things wrong

539
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,799
we don't have to do stuff only in the ci

540
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,280
cd so if you empower your software

541
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
developers they could do really cool

542
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,520
stuff so in the ide rate when you check

543
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,799
code in

544
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
then you can test as like a final last

545
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
just is everything fine okay and then go

546
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
to prod and this can save a lot of time

547
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
another thing is you can perform just a

548
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,080
subset of tests in the ci cd so there's

549
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,919
usually things where i'm like that will

550
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,840
give me nightmares if we have that in

551
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
prod and so i will select those tests

552
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
and then i'll run other tests against

553
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,960
the dev server i'll run other tests when

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
they check in their code

555
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,160
but then in the ci cd i'm like i'm gonna

556
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,480
do these like six tests like if there's

557
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
injection i really need to know but i

558
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
don't care if the security headers are

559
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,320
messed up and i love security headers

560
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,480
but i'm not gonna break a build over it

561
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,440
so

562
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
this is another way we could go faster

563
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
um

564
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
okay so use a har file

565
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
to ensure your das acts like a laser

566
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
so let me explain this so

567
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
a har file h-a-r

568
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,679
also known as html archive file is a

569
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,760
thing that you can record of you doing

570
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
stuff in a browser so qa people use

571
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
these constantly so who here has done qa

572
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,480
before in their life

573
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
okay so doing the same manual test for

574
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,440
the 10th time

575
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
it's not awesome

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,679
um i do not like it at all and so

577
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
they're like oh let's just automate it

578
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
let's record myself doing it and then as

579
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
the devs continue to push stuff out i'll

580
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
just play the recording and it's like it

581
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,960
passed it failed so you can take a copy

582
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
of those and shove it into a dynamic

583
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
scanner and when you do that

584
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,440
it only tests that thing so let's say

585
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
you're working somewhere in your agile

586
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
and you're using a ci cd

587
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,679
and you're like oh in the sprint we made

588
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,679
these two features the qa person's like

589
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
awesome i'm going to record a thing to

590
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,559
to do that and then they flip the har

591
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
file to me i shove it into the desk

592
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
instead of the dust having to crawl

593
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
and look through things and then brute

594
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
force everything and figure out what's

595
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,760
going on

596
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
it's just laser focused you can make it

597
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,400
take 15 to 20 percent as long as it

598
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,039
usually takes by doing this

599
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,039
it only really works though if someone

600
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,200
else is going to record those har files

601
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
for you because if you are an apsec team

602
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
of one if you are a uniforce like i have

603
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,400
been and many of you probably are

604
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,720
you can't sit there and like record hard

605
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
files all day you'll die

606
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
but if you have an awesome qa team that

607
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
does automation you can work together

608
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,720
they can be your best friends and you

609
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
can like just be really really fast

610
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,120
okay so next

611
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,919
i really like blue this car is nice um

612
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
so only test critical or high issues and

613
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
skip everything else

614
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,280
you can do this like you go into like a

615
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
dynamic assass whatever tool and you're

616
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
like skip that

617
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
skip that just do these things i'm

618
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,159
scared about these things

619
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,120
my team's not ready for that yet

620
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
and then you can just test the things

621
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
you want to you can also is this the

622
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
next one

623
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
oh no that's that's different um but

624
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
basically skip the tests that don't

625
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,559
matter to you

626
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
right so some

627
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,960
i keep i still find injection improv all

628
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,760
the time despite owasp's best efforts of

629
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,320
alerting the entire world how bad it is

630
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,200
and

631
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
so like if i go somewhere and i do some

632
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,799
tests and i find it i'm like well that's

633
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,159
going to be the one of the things i'm

634
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,360
scanning for

635
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,720
but if i work at a place where they have

636
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
really good apsec education

637
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,679
and they've been doing this a long time

638
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,960
their devs are doing a really good job

639
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,400
i'm like i'll need to test for that i

640
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
know they're not doing that anymore

641
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
we've graduated off of that

642
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,480
okay so the next one

643
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,000
there are newer tools that work faster

644
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
so specifically with sas i have noticed

645
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
a huge trend in our industry so there's

646
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
the original sas

647
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
of whom i won't name

648
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,679
where if i'm a security consultant and i

649
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
have three weeks to analyze the security

650
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
of some code i will use their product

651
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,919
and i will make it perfect

652
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
and i will find everything that might be

653
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
a vulnerability and i will dive down

654
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
recursion i will do all the stuff and

655
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,159
that's awesome

656
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
but usually that's not what we're doing

657
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
usually it's like we need to secure

658
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
these 500 apps

659
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
and we only have two people to do it and

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
one of them's busy and so i'm like oh

661
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,400
i'm going to buy a newer next generation

662
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
style sass

663
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
and just to be clear i like sassed i'm

664
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
not trying to say anything bad about it

665
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
but i'll use one that's newer where

666
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
instead of doing symbolic analysis what

667
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
it's doing is just

668
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,720
matching known anti patterns it's like i

669
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,120
know if you have this pattern you suck

670
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
it's so lightning fast it's super super

671
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
fast and i won't name some of them while

672
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,559
we're filming because i try not to say

673
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
good or bad things about vendors

674
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,000
publicly

675
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
i accept one but i'm not gonna say that

676
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,860
i'm gonna hold i can do this shut up um

677
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,919
[Music]

678
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,360
but basically

679
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
what you can do is like run one of these

680
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
newer tools it's not perfect and you've

681
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
accepted you're only going to be good

682
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,200
and that's okay for where you are right

683
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,039
now and maybe in two years from then you

684
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
do want to be perfect but for now you're

685
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
just going to clean up the huge mess

686
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,559
that the previous people left and then

687
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,240
you're going to do that later and next

688
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
generation sas tools can do an awesome

689
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
job of that

690
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,200
i'm sure they wouldn't tell you that

691
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
okay so teach secure coding i realized

692
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
that you're like tanya's really biased

693
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
because she sells secure coding however

694
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
my company got bought a few months ago

695
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
and all my online training is free now

696
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,919
so i'm now not selling you that but i

697
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,000
think it's really really so first of all

698
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
take the free courses from wehack purple

699
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
if you have devs that need to learn

700
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
secure coding it's free why not

701
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
but

702
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,799
if you can avoid making a mistake in the

703
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,799
first place that's the absolute best

704
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
thing in the world if you can make it so

705
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
that dev finds the mistake before it's

706
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
checked into the code that's the second

707
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,000
best if you can like the earlier you

708
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
find something that's cheaper and the

709
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
easier it is to fix it you're going to

710
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
save money you're going to save time

711
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
and sometimes when you find a bug way

712
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,440
later

713
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
you have to use like duct tape and

714
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,000
masking tape to try to fix it because

715
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,679
like your design has changed so much and

716
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
it's such a huge change so if you can

717
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,360
find things earlier it's way better and

718
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
if you can avoid them that's the

719
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
absolute number one best

720
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,559
and then um

721
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,120
implement manual peer review of code i

722
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
know that that might sound silly but

723
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
like if you teach secure coding and then

724
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
you have people check someone else's

725
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
pull request before it goes in

726
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
you can spot so many things

727
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,159
like you can avoid things getting

728
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,760
checked in so that's like the second

729
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,400
best place that you can find stuff okay

730
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,159
and then i think this is the last one

731
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
practice practice practice practice

732
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,039
practice

733
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,360
before you start breaking builds

734
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,440
so i like to run

735
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
the pipeline i run it again i run it

736
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
again i run it again

737
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
and then finally i'm like i'm ready to

738
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,960
break builds because the team is passing

739
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
and if we find a bug it's probably going

740
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
to be real

741
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
it's probably going to be very bad

742
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,279
and we really don't want it to get into

743
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,200
prod it will be a mistake it somehow got

744
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,960
past everything else and we will break

745
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
it and we will know we should have

746
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
broken it because it's a true emergency

747
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
when we break a build it is similar to

748
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,559
pulling the and on cord in an assembly

749
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,200
line when you stop an assembly line at a

750
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
big company it costs thousands of

751
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
dollars a second

752
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,000
every single person in the factory

753
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
stopped and you stop because someone's

754
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,400
arm is in a meat grinder

755
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
you stop because

756
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,679
the one thing's breaking the next thing

757
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,360
breaking the next thing or the pieces

758
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
are coming out wrong for some reason

759
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,320
because a piece of equipment is is

760
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
broken

761
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
you when you stop it's serious and we

762
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,919
need to treat it like that so we can go

763
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,640
fast and so this is the picture slide

764
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,799
for this the summary of that

765
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,039
we still have three more topics to go

766
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,000
and as far as i can tell i am doing okay

767
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
for time

768
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,559
yes

769
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,320
that's awesome

770
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
i also have like a slightly silly meme

771
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
after this that you probably don't need

772
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
to take your things out for but i really

773
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
like to show it when i meet with csos

774
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
um how are we doing

775
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
okay i think we're good

776
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,880
uh so i finally checked all the boxes

777
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,799
that means we're secure

778
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,000
finally

779
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,559
ah i wish i had his checklist be so much

780
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,600
easier

781
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,720
um okay so the next thing is an insecure

782
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
system development life cycle so if we

783
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
only do checks

784
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
in the ci cd

785
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
we don't give them feedback we don't

786
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
give them training we don't give them

787
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,039
guidance

788
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,520
like we're setting them up for failure

789
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
most software developers don't get

790
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,799
taught security when they go to school

791
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
they get taught nothing i wrote alice

792
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,679
and bob learn absec and i approached

793
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
university in college

794
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
so many of them so many of them are like

795
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
cool we'll teach the cyber students and

796
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,679
like teach the devs

797
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,039
i want to stop the problem from

798
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,480
happening in the first place not teach

799
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
someone else how to mop it up

800
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,080
and all of them are like that's stupid

801
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,840
why would we teach devs absec and i was

802
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,039
like so now i'm writing another book

803
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,640
about secure coding in hopes that maybe

804
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
one day i'll be accepted by academia but

805
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,039
i digress so if we have no security

806
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
activities during our system development

807
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,039
life cycle this is bad

808
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,720
and if we only have one in the ci cd

809
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
we're just doing in the ci cd it's late

810
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
it's more expensive this way so

811
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,360
i want to talk about very briefly

812
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,200
because i will go on and on like

813
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,360
literally 250 pages according to my

814
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,600
author or my publisher i really like

815
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
secure system development life cycles so

816
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
here's some things you could do

817
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
other than just shoving tools into a ci

818
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,720
cd

819
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,799
you could give project security

820
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,240
requirements

821
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
what if we told them what we wanted we

822
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,679
might even get it

823
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
we could do a whiteboarding session when

824
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,679
they're doing their design and just go

825
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,840
over and ask a few questions and offer

826
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
security advice

827
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,679
we could do security unit tests so if

828
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,200
they're writing lots of unit tests we

829
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,279
could turn some of them into security

830
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,559
unit tests

831
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,880
we could do threat modeling we could do

832
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,440
secure code review or do static analysis

833
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
of our code we could look at our

834
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
dependencies and make sure the

835
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,919
dependencies are not really scary

836
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,399
and known to be vulnerable to use a tool

837
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
for this it's called software

838
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,919
composition analysis

839
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,240
we could do secure coding training

840
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,039
we could do dynamic analysis so

841
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
sometimes called das where you know

842
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,480
we're like pew pew pew pew and then we

843
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,840
try to figure out what's wrong with the

844
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
running application we could do

845
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,520
penetration testing so penetration

846
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,679
testing is the number one thing i see

847
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
and it's at the end of the sdlc and it

848
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
is the absolute most expensive way to do

849
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,720
appsec actually no it's the second most

850
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,559
the first most is when you have a giant

851
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,919
data breach and that's your first

852
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
security activity sorry correction

853
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
yeah and i was a pen tester so just to

854
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,960
be clear i love i think pen testing is

855
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,399
important but i think it should be the

856
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,720
last final like when you put the cherry

857
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
on top of the cake of your security

858
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
so security regression testing so run

859
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,679
those unit tests every time they check

860
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,159
in the code check your security again

861
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,919
guidance for all technologies so let's

862
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,000
say they're making a serverless

863
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,880
app

864
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
what if you gave them a list of

865
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,320
requirements of what you wanted what if

866
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
you're like you're building an api

867
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
awesome this is the api gateway we use

868
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
here's how to use our service match we

869
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
would like to you to do this this and

870
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,960
this please

871
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,880
most security people are just

872
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,559
they don't say anything they don't give

873
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,399
any guidance and they're like you're so

874
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,679
wrong

875
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,120
why didn't you tell me when you knew i

876
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,399
was building this why are you telling me

877
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
i suck after tell me how to

878
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,279
logging monitoring and alerting because

879
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,520
i say this a lot no one listens but

880
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,360
basically every phase of the system

881
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
development life cycle i want you to

882
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,880
know i'm there for you

883
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,240
and that i can help you make a more

884
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,000
secure app that's what i want as an

885
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,360
appsec person

886
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
um so you don't have to do all of this

887
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
but if you just did one more of these

888
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,399
than you're currently doing

889
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,720
you will see a huge improvement

890
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
okay did everyone get a picture that

891
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
wanted a picture like wave around

892
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
frantically and awkwardly if you still

893
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
need time

894
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
you're not waving awkwardly but i'll let

895
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,600
you take the picture anyway

896
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,760
okay i made this meme i'm so proud

897
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,760
i was like this is what they meant this

898
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
is what actually happened

899
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
so i want to talk about people that

900
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
don't fix bugs

901
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,600
so unfixed bugs um don't worry it's in

902
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
the backlog tanya we're totally going to

903
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
fix it in 2025.

904
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
um so i see this a lot i see oh like so

905
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,399
most clients that i talk to

906
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,240
the biggest thing they focus on is like

907
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,840
tanya they won't fix

908
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
they won't fix our bugs like we send

909
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,919
them stuff and they won't fix the bugs

910
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,760
and sometimes the aptek people are like

911
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
we want 100 of bugs fixed in one day

912
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,320
that's our service level agreement

913
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
that's the sla we want i'm like well

914
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
that that's not happening

915
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,799
um and then devs are like we'll get to

916
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,840
it later

917
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
like we'll do it

918
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,039
i did the security for one of the

919
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,559
elections in canada and i remember like

920
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,480
a dev was like we'll do it after the i

921
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
was like

922
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,720
no i do not want bug fixes after

923
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,679
election day thank you very much

924
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,880
um yeah so we have to find a balance of

925
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,840
never

926
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
an instantaneous bug fixes so we want

927
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,159
when i say sla i mean service level

928
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
agreement so i say don't carve your slas

929
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,880
in stone so be realistic so let's set

930
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
realistic expectations for both sides so

931
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
that you actually get what you want or

932
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,000
what you need like the rolling stones so

933
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
decide your organization's risk

934
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
tolerance so like i said most of us

935
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
don't need to be perfect i used to do

936
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
counterterrorism activities for the

937
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
canadian government which obviously i

938
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
can't tell you more than that but we had

939
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,840
to be

940
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,519
perfect oh my god so good to not have to

941
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,480
be perfect now it's way less work that

942
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,039
last five percent is really hard so then

943
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,039
set our service level agreements based

944
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,679
on what we actually want and then make

945
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,760
sure they're realistic and fair like

946
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,679
i've worked at places where like their

947
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,679
security posture just needs to be not

948
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,760
pathetic and they'll be fine there are

949
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,200
companies like that there's lots of

950
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,039
companies where they're they're not

951
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,720
target for any reason none of their data

952
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,279
is sensitive everyone's pretty chill

953
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,640
and it's like you don't you don't need

954
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
to be you don't even need to be great

955
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,080
you could just be like okay

956
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
and you'll be fine so let's set

957
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
realistic goals

958
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,399
get management support

959
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,960
get management to agree with you

960
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,039
communicate why you chose those service

961
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,679
level agreements and then start small

962
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,279
and go like this so if you don't have

963
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,640
management support if so if you talk to

964
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,880
the head of devs and they're like i

965
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
don't got time for you

966
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,279
this is not important tanya go away um i

967
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,480
have a friend that's dealing with this

968
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,000
right now and he's about to quit he's

969
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
like they pay me

970
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,399
350 000 a year

971
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,760
and he's like i'm going to quit because

972
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,080
no one wants to do any apsec and every

973
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
day i'm a failure and it hurts so much

974
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
so if you get management support

975
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,679
life will be a lot better and then being

976
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
fair and compromising sometimes okay so

977
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,760
support teams and reaching their slas so

978
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,519
last year i did a three-month stint at a

979
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,760
company they were a long time client

980
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,159
they lost their main absence person and

981
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,000
i was moving on to doing another thing

982
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,279
and i was like let's do just three

983
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
straight months and swap out your entire

984
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,200
tool set and modernize your stuff it was

985
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,720
super awesome

986
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,840
and

987
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
we

988
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,159
i had two

989
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,840
two different teams

990
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,760
where it was a tool that had been

991
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
acquired and one of them was 38 years

992
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
old so almost as old as me

993
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,480
and

994
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,080
i was just like

995
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,320
we need to re-architect this let me get

996
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
you more staff and they're like

997
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
what really

998
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,919
like yeah you're not going to be able to

999
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,320
like upgrade off those dependencies

1000
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,519
you have vlog4j version one

1001
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,279
um

1002
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,279
so let's work together and let me get

1003
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,399
you some money and or persons to help

1004
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,480
you to like modernize your app it'll be

1005
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
easier to support it'll be more secure

1006
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
life will be good we know we have to do

1007
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,799
it eventually

1008
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,399
and so i supported them in reaching

1009
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,480
their slas and i gave them time to

1010
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,559
address their technical debt and i gave

1011
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,720
them rules to triage so if you see this

1012
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
you've got to fix it but if you see

1013
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,399
these things we can talk about it

1014
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,080
and then because they're really worried

1015
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
to meet me that i would be like you suck

1016
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,760
and i was like you're in a bad place

1017
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,239
let's put you in a good place so

1018
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,399
sometimes you have to help them reach

1019
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,480
their service level agreements

1020
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,119
oh yes so with triaging

1021
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,280
i put like a few rules here

1022
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
one more that's it okay so like what do

1023
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
they have to fix how do they validate

1024
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,599
things if if your tool gives false

1025
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,119
positives sometimes

1026
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,359
so i like to train them show them how

1027
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,800
um but basically

1028
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,879
if you can make a grid

1029
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,440
like if tool x finds this this this or

1030
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
this you gotta fix it right away if it

1031
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,879
finds any of these things could you fix

1032
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,520
it in the next 90 days everything else

1033
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,480
fine

1034
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,839
then they can just look at it and be

1035
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,280
like i'm cool

1036
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,399
it sounds weird

1037
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,918
and takes time to set up but once you

1038
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,520
have it you have way less emails in your

1039
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
inbox

1040
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,719
okay so let's

1041
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,839
um set realistic expectations so

1042
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,440
a thing i really like to do is figure

1043
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
out how a bug happened and how we can

1044
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,359
prevent it in the future so if i see

1045
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,760
injection okay so let's give a lunch and

1046
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,200
learn on injection let's show everyone

1047
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,119
how to find injection let's show them

1048
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,440
how to review code for it

1049
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
um and then i like to search all the

1050
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,960
repos and destroy it

1051
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,400
because if you see

1052
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
one problem that dev probably worked on

1053
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
a lot of things and i kind of like

1054
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,440
searching code repos and finding

1055
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,520
patterns and destroying them so that's

1056
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,599
my idea of a good time

1057
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,400
um this is the picture slide because

1058
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
there's a lot of things that i said

1059
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
there there are a lot and then we're

1060
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,839
gonna get onto the bruce willis themed

1061
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,160
part of this presentation because that's

1062
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,300
important

1063
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,309
[Music]

1064
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,200
okay so i started a training company

1065
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
not because

1066
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
that's what i necessarily wanted to do

1067
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,520
but because i asked everyone what i

1068
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
should do and all of them said i wish

1069
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
you would show me how you do the thing

1070
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,720
you do

1071
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,560
and person after person was like you

1072
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,440
should

1073
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
teach us how you do apsec

1074
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,079
you should i would pay money for that

1075
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,440
and it turned out people gave me money

1076
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,800
and so then i did it more and more and

1077
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
then i had a company

1078
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,440
but i'm going to talk about training

1079
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,240
new tech dev security

1080
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
um

1081
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,119
so when i worked in the government of

1082
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,200
canada for 13 and a half years

1083
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
performing public service

1084
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,400
i did security for half of it and they

1085
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
gave me no training our budget was two

1086
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
thousand dollars a year canadian so it's

1087
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
like four american cents

1088
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,320
and

1089
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,079
and i really really really really really

1090
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,839
want to go to sands really really badly

1091
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,839
and if you're watching sans i would love

1092
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,520
to go um

1093
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
i would so take any of their courses if

1094
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,960
i could for free but but a sans course

1095
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,640
in canadian dollars is around ten

1096
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
thousand dollars

1097
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
and so that would be five years of my

1098
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,839
training budget i'm like can i bank my

1099
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,240
budget they're like no i'm like

1100
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
can i and they're like you cannot take

1101
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,359
all your teammates budget

1102
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,200
and so i never got to go so i started

1103
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,960
speaking at conferences i kid you not

1104
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,560
for the sole reason i could get him free

1105
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
and i could learn

1106
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
and so

1107
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,720
this causes problems so there's a lack

1108
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,880
of training and knowledge so training

1109
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
and knowledge are not the same thing

1110
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
knowledge comes from experience and

1111
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,839
learning sometimes you go on training

1112
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,640
and unfortunately don't learn that much

1113
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,599
so

1114
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,079
bruce willis what if we train them and

1115
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,000
they leave i remember my boss saying

1116
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,359
this i'm like what if you don't train me

1117
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,280
and i stay

1118
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,800
this is a problem

1119
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,960
especially in

1120
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,680
public sector where the budgets are very

1121
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,400
small

1122
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,079
if you like when i worked at microsoft

1123
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,640
it was awesome gave me lots of training

1124
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,079
sent me on all these things paid for

1125
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,720
stuff i was like i'm a genius now

1126
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,040
but before that i had to figure out a

1127
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
way and so

1128
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
i would like to just briefly now that i

1129
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,040
do not sell training

1130
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,920
um

1131
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,680
perks of training your team so this is

1132
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,520
stuff i've seen so

1133
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,200
employees that receive training are more

1134
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,040
likely to keep working for you because

1135
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,599
it is a big bonus for them it's awesome

1136
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,599
to be invested in

1137
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,680
they're usually happier than ones that

1138
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,599
don't know what the hell they're doing

1139
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,680
they're more productive they make fewer

1140
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
technical errors

1141
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,440
and that can be very expensive if you

1142
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
are lucky like really lucky they will

1143
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
share what they have learned with

1144
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
everyone else so they come back with a

1145
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
book and then they loan it to everyone

1146
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,200
they're like hey let me show you the

1147
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
thing i built

1148
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
um lastly they are potentially a

1149
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,720
security champion

1150
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,040
and i really really like that

1151
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
i'm a big fan of security champions i

1152
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
talk about it a lot i wrote a ten point

1153
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
blog article about it because i just i

1154
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
really love it and that is how i have

1155
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
scaled most of my security programs

1156
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,240
because i realized there's like hundreds

1157
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,839
of them and one of me

1158
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,400
and as much as i i think i'm great

1159
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,160
i'm not that great

1160
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,400
i'm not able to like talk to 400 people

1161
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,760
and get to know all of them and review

1162
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
everyone's code so i need to scale and

1163
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,640
with training you can identify the

1164
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,119
really golden ones that might become a

1165
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,560
champion for you

1166
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,200
um join opsec they said it would be easy

1167
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
they said

1168
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
oh poor bruce

1169
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,040
so i want to do a conclusion

1170
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,599
um and like oh i'm totally awesome for

1171
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,880
time yes

1172
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,000
so i'm gonna give you a bunch of

1173
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
resources at the end so we're not quite

1174
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,800
done

1175
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
devsecops only works if you do the work

1176
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,520
you can't just throw a tool in there and

1177
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,200
have it work perfectly and that's okay

1178
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,119
you are still awesome

1179
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,200
we must avoid false positives in the ci

1180
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
cd whenever possible if you break the

1181
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,000
build and it's a false alarm there's egg

1182
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,839
all over your face

1183
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,640
they don't forget

1184
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
tooling must be fast and if it can't be

1185
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,920
fast or it can't have mostly true

1186
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,160
positives we do it outside the pipeline

1187
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
we're still awesome we can still

1188
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
automate it it can still be great but it

1189
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
doesn't belong in the pipeline

1190
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,119
the rest of the sdlc needs to have

1191
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,560
security steps

1192
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,839
we can't

1193
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,240
we can't just

1194
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,000
can't only look then

1195
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,160
we're really we're losing an opportunity

1196
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,599
if that's when we start

1197
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,400
um

1198
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
i negotiate with devs to fix bugs i

1199
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,640
never come in i'm like you're doing this

1200
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
i am not their boss i have no possible

1201
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,680
way to control them i am open to bribing

1202
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,520
them with cookies or training or

1203
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,680
whatever will work but i cannot make

1204
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,800
them fix bugs so i negotiate

1205
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,960
work together and be realistic and

1206
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,160
sometimes that means we don't get the

1207
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,680
thing we want or we don't get it for a

1208
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,839
few more weeks and we're stressed but

1209
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,200
we'll live

1210
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,040
providing training and share knowledge

1211
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,520
every chance you can get because it will

1212
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
value you so if you learn a cool new

1213
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
abstech thing maybe you want to show all

1214
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
your security champions or talk about it

1215
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,560
at the all staff

1216
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,640
die hard is a christmas movie and i will

1217
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,800
die on this hill

1218
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,000
and

1219
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,839
and you can do this you really can do

1220
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
this i hope that this made it sound more

1221
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,480
doable instead of less doable you can do

1222
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,880
this for real i'm not kidding i want to

1223
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
encourage all of you

1224
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
like even if you just get one tool

1225
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,800
scanning in a pipeline you're way ahead

1226
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,040
of where you previously were you really

1227
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,760
are

1228
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,079
and so with that i would like to give

1229
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,640
you a few free resources i like giving

1230
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,800
resources um so i have a podcast and um

1231
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
so we just

1232
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,480
we're just recorded season three like

1233
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
the first one of season three and it's

1234
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
just about appsec now so it used to be

1235
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,480
about how to get into cyber then it was

1236
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,319
like mini cyber security bite-sized

1237
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,359
lessons

1238
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,040
and now it's just going to be oh apsack

1239
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,480
all the time so i had my professional

1240
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,119
mentor sharif kusa on who's the founder

1241
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,520
of software secured and reshift and

1242
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
he is the person that got me to join

1243
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,599
oaus but made me a chapter leader and

1244
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,480
like just encouraged me so much in my

1245
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,680
journey and he's so smart and i just got

1246
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,359
to pick his brain for an hour it's

1247
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:44,480
awesome

1248
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,200
um i really like books i really like

1249
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,680
these books me and my mom both agree

1250
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,520
that alice and bob learn is the best

1251
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,640
book um but any of the top four books in

1252
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,520
yellow are fantastic devops resources i

1253
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,359
own multiple copies of each of them like

1254
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,480
i have the ebook and then i have the

1255
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,920
physical book and then i have the audio

1256
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,839
book because i like them so much they're

1257
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,560
really really really really good okay so

1258
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,200
the next one is the community so like i

1259
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,040
said my company got acquired earlier

1260
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,280
this year and now all of our courses are

1261
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,359
free all of our events are free the

1262
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,359
community is free we don't sell anything

1263
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,240
now we just teach and train and

1264
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,480
network for free and so all of you are

1265
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,920
invited

1266
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,720
um every monday on twitter since 2018 i

1267
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,000
have done this thing called cyber

1268
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,040
mentoring monday so i realized that me

1269
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,160
providing

1270
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,760
finding a professional mentor just

1271
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
brought me to the next level

1272
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,760
like it propelled my career in a way

1273
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,000
that i never knew was possible before

1274
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,599
and so i try to help people find

1275
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,000
professional mentors every single monday

1276
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,760
even when it's christmas it's pretty

1277
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,040
slow on christmas in case you're

1278
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,000
wondering

1279
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,800
um but basically i use this hashtag to

1280
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
try to help people join together and

1281
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,119
find each other and it has resulted in

1282
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,960
lots and lots of jobs tons of

1283
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,680
friendships people like forming

1284
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
companies together it's been really

1285
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,400
magical to see so many senior members of

1286
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,960
the information security community take

1287
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,079
time for free to help newbies join our

1288
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,760
community and excel

1289
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,000
i've been astounded by the generosity of

1290
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,240
our industry repeatedly

1291
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,400
um bright so i work at bright and they

1292
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,200
have a highly technical blog so if you

1293
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,880
um are using a tool and you find a

1294
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,200
vulnerability even if it's not ours um

1295
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
we have how to fix it for like basically

1296
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,560
everything ever

1297
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,800
um we also like sometimes they let me

1298
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,359
post stuff like i said i'm obsessed with

1299
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,200
log4j and i wrote like a postmortem and

1300
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
they let me publish it there so there's

1301
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,400
also like not just remediation advice um

1302
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
me so i'm the last resource i'm gonna

1303
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,280
list me i'm a nerd on the internet and i

1304
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
um tweet and make videos and i have a

1305
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,119
newsletter that i occasionally actually

1306
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,079
release

1307
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,160
um and i really like making content and

1308
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,800
i really like hearing from you

1309
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,960
and so i'm doing this ask me anything

1310
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,800
right now where people can just send me

1311
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,240
questions and then i make a video for

1312
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,040
everyone about it and so i released nine

1313
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,599
last week and that was fun and so with

1314
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,720
that

1315
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,720

hi question for you um i'm a big fan of

1358
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,160
security champions i think they're a

1359
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,040
great way to scale yes uh on your blog

1360
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,280
or on your your your char for security

1361
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,960
champions a lot of the stuff was set up

1362
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,839
one-on-ones and you know building

1363
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,640
connections that

1364
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,720
starts falling apart as you get towards

1365
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,280
larger security champions teams such as

1366
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,000
a company i work for has 1500 security

1367
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,040
champions any suggestions for very large

1368
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
orgs like that and how to scale past

1369
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
your do you have 1500 security champions

1370
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,119
or 1500 devs

1371
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,079
security champions oh my god so how many

1372
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,280
teams do you have 1500 teams then i did

1373
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
close yeah okay so how large or very

1374
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,160
large order how many apps do you how

1375
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
many sorry how many apsec people do you

1376
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,200
have

1377
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,520
uh i'm not sure that number uh that's

1378
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,680
okay i'm about 20. that's okay but not

1379
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
like we never have as many as we want

1380
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
right and so

1381
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
basically sometimes what i do with my

1382
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,800
bosses

1383
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,599
is

1384
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,440
i will explain to them like i need more

1385
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,520
staff and here's my return on investment

1386
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,040
that i can show you from that and here's

1387
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,640
how i can show you how i can't complete

1388
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,920
my job unless blah and so it like let's

1389
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,720
say you have like six other people so

1390
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,880
that's seven people and you're like we

1391
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,640
have this many hours and this many days

1392
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,319
i can meet with like three security

1393
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,000
champions per day for 30 minutes and

1394
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,839
then i have to do the rest of my job and

1395
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,839
address the things they told me and said

1396
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,839
and so calculating this i need this many

1397
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,680
more people and if you're not going to

1398
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,160
do that then i can't do the job as well

1399
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,560
as i want to and so sometimes what i'll

1400
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
do is i'll pick

1401
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,640
so i'll have every security champion

1402
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,720
attend the trainings but then i'll only

1403
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,119
meet one-on-one like once a month

1404
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,319
or less

1405
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,559
or i'll just pick out the most sensitive

1406
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,599
high

1407
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,520
high priority ones and sometimes it's

1408
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
the big famous product sometimes it's

1409
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,040
the one that's on fire that's trash

1410
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,119
that's dying and so i usually make a

1411
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,480
nightmare list

1412
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,079
and a wonderful awesome list if that

1413
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,680
makes sense and i like try really

1414
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,119
because like what a lot of teams do is

1415
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,359
they just focus on the cool new apps

1416
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,599
and they leave all the legacy behind and

1417
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,760
as a malicious actor or pen tester the

1418
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,440
first thing i do is i was like last

1419
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,800
update in 2008 i'm starting here

1420
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,079
and so

1421
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:58,880
um

1422
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,800
explain to them like just based on the

1423
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,319
number of hours i work how this is

1424
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,400
impossible and if they say well you can

1425
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,160
meet with 16 people per day because you

1426
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,599
have eight hours explain to them how

1427
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,200
that's full

1428
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,720
because some of them will say stupid

1429
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,760
things

1430
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,839
does that help yeah you deserve two

1431
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,920
candies

1432
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,559
um next please

1433
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,720
so you mentioned that your podcast and

1434
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,240
obviously there's other resources for

1435
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,599
like can you speak more into the

1436
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,800
microphone

1437
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,079
so you mentioned your podcast and

1438
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,760
obviously there's other resources that

1439
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,160
how you can get um

1440
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,640
like training for but like what would

1441
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,480
you say is a good resource to see for

1442
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,559
people who are looking f

1443
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,640
maybe if they want to get into like

1444
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,000
what's a good resource to see like okay

1445
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,640
this is what your typical day-to-day

1446
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,880
cause you know obviously movies are bad

1447
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,160
books are bad like you know they don't

1448
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
really show you what it's like to do

1449
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,680
that job okay

1450
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,200
for those people who are like trying to

1451
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,640
figure out do they want to change

1452
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
careers etc what would you recommend

1453
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,720
okay so i have three resources for you

1454
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,599
so one is a blog post that i wrote

1455
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,280
called jobs in infosec and if you google

1456
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,680
jobs in infosec and then like she hacks

1457
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,359
purple you'll find it immediately it

1458
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,440
gets thousands of reads per month and i

1459
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
wrote it like two or three years ago and

1460
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,839
i describe every single job then there's

1461
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,480
this lady named alyssa miller and she's

1462
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,920
speaking here right now at the exact

1463
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,280
same time as me which really sucks

1464
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,640
because she i wanted to see that um

1465
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,760
anyway she just published a book about

1466
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,440
all the different types of jobs with

1467
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,920
interviews of people who did those jobs

1468
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,319
and then the third one is season one of

1469
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,960
we hack purple podcast where i

1470
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,720
interviewed

1471
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,119
about 50 different infosec professionals

1472
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,720
and asked them all about their job and

1473
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,319
what every day was like and how do you

1474
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,400
get this job and like what personality

1475
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,839
traits make you better and stuff at the

1476
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,240
job and then they give

1477
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,280
stuff on how to go get into that job and

1478
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,119
so between those three things you should

1479
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,720
be good and if you don't remember what i

1480
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
said tweet at me and i'll tweet the

1481
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,559
answer back at you in writing so that's

1482
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,359
helpful awesome thank you you deserve

1483
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,359
candy

1484
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:05,599
everyone who wants to come up and get

1485
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,359
stickers now because it turns out i'm

1486
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,000
getting booted in like four minutes yes

1487
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,119
so

1488
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,640
so this is a real case that i had

1489
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,720
um and i'm an app developer

1490
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,680
and

1491
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,760
the problem was so fundamental to the

1492
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,079
code i'll tell you the end the problem

1493
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,599
is so fundamental to the code that they

1494
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,319
end up throwing away the entire chunk of

1495
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,280
code

1496
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,400
and replacing with the purchase project

1497
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,319
okay so that was that and that took

1498
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,079
years and years to figure out but

1499
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,000
fundamentally the prop the code was so

1500
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
broken that it had built into it an

1501
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
account takeover bug

1502
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,319
oh so how do you manage an abstract

1503
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,640
situation like that is so fundamental

1504
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,880
to a fundamental architectural failure

1505
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,400
of the code

1506
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,800
how do you manage that sort of

1507
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,079
conversation

1508
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,000
um do you have they said like no we're

1509
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,640
not fixing it well no i was the app

1510
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,119
person who found it and i tried to fix

1511
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:03,839
it

1512
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,400
and other people it was basically years

1513
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,559
of we give up we're going to throw away

1514
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,760
the entire code base oh wow so i wasn't

1515
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,640
in security i just found it right so i

1516
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,160
was wondering how would you manage that

1517
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,240
as an abstract person because this is

1518
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,960
not making up case real

1519
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,559
so sometimes a rewrite is necessary

1520
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,400
like sometimes that makes it so much

1521
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,880
better especially like because of the

1522
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,559
performance and other things of the app

1523
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,800
and how it's easier to maintain

1524
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
yeah but in this case it was i looked at

1525
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,160
it was it was like once it was just like

1526
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,200
how do you manage it where you can't fix

1527
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,000
it

1528
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
fix is not is off the table and

1529
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,480
everybody says we'd love to but we can't

1530
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,559
okay so then i usually put a band-aid on

1531
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,599
it also known as a waff or a rasp

1532
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:52,559
and so

1533
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,359
oaf is a web app firewall and a rasp is

1534
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,200
a runtime application security

1535
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,559
protection tool

1536
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,240
a rasp is more modern it's going to cost

1537
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,520
you more money but it's going to do a

1538
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,680
better job all the waft people just be

1539
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,559
quiet

1540
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,520
um

1541
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,359
basically but it's a binary and you have

1542
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,200
to stick it inside your application it

1543
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
takes a while to set up

1544
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,920
but then it will block malicious input a

1545
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,760
waff is more like a bunch of regular

1546
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,280
expression that lives on your web server

1547
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
and it's like that looks bad no that

1548
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,359
looks bad no but advanced attackers can

1549
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,480
often get past that well a rasp is uh

1550
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,400
has better results and tends to have

1551
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,319
less latencies but will cost more money

1552
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,079
and take significantly more time to set

1553
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,800
up but less time to maintain

1554
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,440
okay does that help i don't know but i

1555
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,680
want to let someone else go okay i'm

1556
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,400
being kicked out now i have to go but if

1557
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,319
you two want to go outside the door i

1558
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,760
would love to take questions from you

1559
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,119
and you still get a candy because you're

1560
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,839
still awesome
