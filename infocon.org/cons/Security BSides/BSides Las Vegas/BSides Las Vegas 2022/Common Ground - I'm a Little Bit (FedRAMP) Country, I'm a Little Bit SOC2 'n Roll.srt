person you're interested in doing your

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,060
uplift uh we're here to give you lots of

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,460
hints and tips and share the pain

thank you so much for coming to our talk

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,060
thanks Wendy uh Shane angle I am

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,159
currently a practice lead and director

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,259
of audit services for Leviathan Security

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,579
Group

43
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,680
um have been in security for about 15

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
years

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,159
listing all of the roles that require

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,140
sitting over a drink for a long time or

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,299
something I've been working in bed rent

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,840
since 2014. that picture was taken

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,060
roughly

50
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,979
2013 which is fed rank is one of the

51
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,299
reasons why there's a lot more gray hair

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,500
now

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,320
um and I have the cutest dogs in the

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,180
world which Wendy is going to disagree

55
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,740
with me on

56
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,899
yeah I bring photograph proof in this

57
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,960
slide but hi I'm Wendy I'm CSO at a

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,878
startup that works a lot of healthcare

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,580
information but in a prior life I did a

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,800
lot of fedramp I also did a ton of sock

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,959
to work so I'm going to be speaking

62
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,120
mostly to the sock 2 side of this both

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,819
of us have done both the audit programs

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,260
so we'll both speak a little bit to them

65
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,379
but I am here representing stock too and

66
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,480
that is my puppy dog's little black and

67
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
white one up there her name is tally she

68
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,780
just turned a year old she is a walking

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,519
fuzzy Cloud as Mara Tam says

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,540
uh that is truly on the left and uh Joey

71
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,760
on the right Joey is best described as

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,459
if a raccoon was raised by a family of

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,440
cats that's what his behavior would be

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,720
and trivia you can kind of see that

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
picture is best described as a Chihuahua

76
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,239
head transplanted onto a potato body I

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,560
love them dearly and they're clearly

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,220
much cuter

79
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,000
cool so who is this for uh if you have

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,860
ever done a sock 2 type 2 I guess if

81
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,540
you've ever done a sock 2 type 1 but

82
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,120
it's gonna be even bigger uplift there

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,040
there's a federal agency that might be

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
interested in your really cool whiz bang

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,659
uh product uh you want to sell your

86
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,459
Cloud offering to like Department of

87
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,680
Transportation

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,959
FBI or so forth you will need to go

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,860
through bedramp

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,080
you

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,780
so um

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,360
so you know when he said so maybe you

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,459
have an existing stock 2 program you're

94
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,140
looking to achieve uh Federal

95
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,940
authorization

96
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,799
um and the initial thought often when

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,140
you're dealing with competing programs

98
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,299
like that is well great now I have to

99
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,099
start over from scratch

100
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,299
no

101
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,519
uh we will

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,980
but uh

103
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,680
um we will explain how um it is going to

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,900
be a lot of work but you can

105
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,500
um do use your sock 2 work as a lot of

106
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,959
the foundational work for uh Federate

107
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,099
so we'll talk as you said a little bit

108
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,140
about stock 2 introduction bed ramp

109
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,299
introduction and then

110
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,220
what exactly what that uplift that I

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,959
mentioned is going to be and then some

112
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,940
strategies for achieving fedramp

113
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,978
authorization and kind of reducing the

114
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,120
pain level on that

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,160
cool so I'm going to do a little bit of

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
level socket setting on stock too how

117
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,220
many people here have ever been through

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,680
a stock 2 audit of any kind

119
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,820
okay

120
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,860
so this will be pretty basic this is

121
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,120
probably more for people who have no

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
idea what we're talking about we talk

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
about stock too

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,440
others these things called Trust

125
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,800
Services criteria security availability

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,240
confidentiality are the most common ones

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,860
especially if you're in a cloud

128
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,900
availability and confidentiality aren't

129
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,960
quite gimmies but they're pretty easy uh

130
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,840
easy relatively un can inherit a lot of

131
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,560
that from AWS to your Cloud platform

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,139
for getting the certification you have

133
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,080
to implement controls that Implement

134
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,380
those Trust Services criteria so

135
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,759
insecurity either be some things that

136
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,139
you have to put in place availability

137
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,759
you have a couple more and I'll go

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
through those in a moment and then you

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,139
bring in an audit firm has to be a CPA

140
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,240
firm that's licensed to give a sock 2

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,639
certification they will come in and make

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,139
sure that you are actually following the

143
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,699
controls that you say you follow if you

144
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,840
don't know how to build your own control

145
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,460
set they can help you build a control

146
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,720
set

147
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,160
and you have to show that you had all

148
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,780
these in place throughout

149
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,520
and so I'm going to flag something a lot

150
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,780
of people don't think about the sock 2

151
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,220
which is that the scoping is up to you

152
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,580
so at my startup I am currently working

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,960
with Auditors to Define what our scope

154
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,940
is and I would like it just to be AWS

155
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,220
we're going to leave user endpoints out

156
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,360
because we don't allow health

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
information to leave our AWS account and

158
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,620
so we Define our scope there it's up to

159
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,020
us I have to explain to the Auditors why

160
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,360
I think this is a valid scope but I can

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,280
dictate it and keep that in mind when we

162
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,860
come to fedramp because uh spoiler alert

163
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,780
is a little different

164
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,180
so in terms of defining your controls

165
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
this is something that you will sit down

166
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,960
and look at the Trust Services criteria

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,819
you can basically take the wording they

168
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,520
have in that internet from like the

169
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
entity does to like my company does this

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
a good auditor will be able to work with

171
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,960
you um you can hire Shea uh to come in

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,699
and help you build your control set and

173
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,160
you want to basically have controls that

174
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,660
work with how your company actually

175
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,400
works

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
I'm going to just flag that there's a

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
difference between type 1 type 2 type 1

178
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,919
is a point in time I've done these

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,199
controls at least once I could do them

180
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,479
type two the auditor will look for time

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,100
stamped evidence to show that the

182
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,600
controls are continuously in place

183
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,539
throughout the audit period

184
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,280
so the security principle is really the

185
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
biggest one

186
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,060
um you have some flexibility in the

187
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,099
pieces of it that you do but there's

188
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,479
some commonality like you pretty much

189
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,880
need to have a pen test you need to be

190
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,919
doing some vulnerability management you

191
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,840
can use dependabot I've used dependabot

192
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,699
for several stock 2 audits but you have

193
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,380
to show why it's legit essentially to do

194
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,460
most of your vulnerability management

195
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,400
through that you need to do instant

196
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,500
response tabletops and so forth but

197
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,479
really so long as you are checking

198
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
enough of the boxes in the principles

199
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,800
your control set is pretty much written

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,940
by you

201
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,220
uh risk register and risk management is

202
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,680
a huge part of stock 2. do you know what

203
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
the rest of your organization are and is

204
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,039
your management aware and briefed on

205
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,240
them

206
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,900
there's a lot also of business controls

207
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,220
here

208
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,780
um do you have a code of conduct for

209
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,880
your employees one that I like because I

210
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,919
have to comply with HIPAA is I can show

211
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,539
that we have a sanctions policy in place

212
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,220
and that gives me credit for my sock too

213
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,240
also

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,039
so that's more of an administrative sort

215
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,660
of thing that sock 2 wants to look at a

216
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,099
well-run organization and does

217
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,660
management understand what is happening

218
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,160
on the ground level

219
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,800
you have to show that um you interview

220
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
people and you hire them you're not just

221
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,099
pulling people off the street and

222
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,360
bringing them in you have to do

223
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,400
performance reviews and so forth

224
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,199
and so the security principle is a

225
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,060
little bit more than just um are you

226
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,400
patching your machines and running an

227
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,860
incident response program

228
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,560
if you're on AWS availability is a lot

229
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
of pass-through you just have to show

230
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,699
that you know you can scale uh show that

231
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,500
you're doing some level of backups and

232
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,080
restoration usually using AWS uh tooling

233
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,599
there are a couple these are the

234
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,740
principles that you have to implement

235
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,240
your controls for

236
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
um showing that you know we measure our

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,539
usage and we can handle searches if it's

238
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,000
going to come and we're forecasting our

239
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
growth and so management is not going to

240
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,000
be shocked when next year we're like oh

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,500
yeah we need to completely scale up our

242
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
S3 usage

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,940
confidentiality is also another one that

244
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,060
if you're on a cloud provider is almost

245
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,320
you know an easy add-on easy because you

246
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,540
are using their destruction of machines

247
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,940
you can rely on their stock too if you

248
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,860
open up a stock too for someone who's on

249
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,720
AWS and they've done confidentiality

250
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,180
principle you see a lot of AWS controls

251
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,440
listed and so you're pulling from their

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,959
sock too and so the type of things that

253
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,459
you are responsible for instead of the

254
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,279
cloud provider is that if your user

255
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,260
endpoints are in scope you need to show

256
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,899
that you're destroying those either

257
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,540
through you know cryptographic uh

258
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
destruction where you change the

259
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,720
password to file Vault or so forth or

260
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,980
getting them shredded by someone that

261
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,120
gives you a certificate of Destruction

262
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,339
and you have data classification in

263
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,140
place and you know where stuff goes so I

264
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,940
have a data classification policy in

265
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,339
place and I know that Phi can only go

266
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,320
into certain HIPAA approved systems

267
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,940
within AWS and I have to make sure that

268
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,500
my Engineers follow that and that I can

269
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,880
enforce it and make sure it's being

270
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,820
followed so that is stock two in like

271
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,779
three minutes

272
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,980
um if you have specific stock two

273
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,080
questions uh we're gonna touch on some

274
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,279
of these a little bit more later you can

275
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,620
come talk to us but the meat of this is

276
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,940
going to be fedramp and so I'm going to

277
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,540
give this to Shay

278
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,260
thanks Wendy so um what exactly is

279
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,940
fedramp and this will be kind of

280
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,860
breakdown of what it is and and a little

281
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,660
history government history lesson as

282
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,519
well so

283
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,040
um initially released uh by the US

284
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,380
federal government in 2011

285
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,500
um based on this 853

286
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,140
um and it provides both a standardized

287
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,180
assessment process for people looking to

288
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,560
get authorized and a standardized

289
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,440
authorization process and the idea

290
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,380
behind both of those is that if you want

291
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,779
to sell a product to say five different

292
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,300
agencies hopefully you don't have to get

293
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
assessed five different kinds the idea

294
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,620
is that your initial authorization

295
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,260
theoretically can be reused by other

296
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,720
agencies that you're looking to

297
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,700
um looking to work with

298
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,200
um any of the federal infants Focus

299
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,480
specifically on

300
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,980
um what the program refers to as cloud

301
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,279
service providers so selling it

302
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,899
cloud-based oops selling a cloud-based

303
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,200
offering to one or more federal agencies

304
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,399
um

305
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,680
a couple of terms

306
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
um organizations you will hear about and

307
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,540
deal with in the process

308
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,240
um fedrap jab is the joint authorization

309
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
board

310
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,180
um I'll get into exactly what the joint

311
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,740
authorization board is in a little bit

312
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,560
so just kind of stay tuned on that

313
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,860
um fedramp pmo administers

314
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,459
um

315
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,220
everything and then you may you will

316
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,820
eventually be dealing with one or more

317
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,760
agencies through the process so

318
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,519
um the fedrap authorization

319
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,260
um will give you the ability to provide

320
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,500
services to one or more agencies there

321
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,880
are a couple of different paths that you

322
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
can go

323
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,700
um either what's called an agency

324
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,860
authorization which I'll explain details

325
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,620
on or what's called a provisional ATO or

326
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,560
authority to operate on provisional atos

327
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,339
are provided by The Joint Advisory Board

328
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,100
um and then uh authorizing officials or

329
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,019
AOS are basically the people that will

330
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,519
sign off on your authorization

331
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,740
so

332
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,959
um if you've looked at fed ramp at all

333
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,240
you've heard about veteran blow and

334
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,399
moderate and high and a few other things

335
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,680
that we'll get into later

336
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,180
um that's referred to as the impact

337
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,040
level and it's really a measure of

338
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
potential risk for the system

339
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,459
um so determining uh impact level is

340
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,560
done typically by the cloud service

341
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,440
provider very early on in the process uh

342
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,260
using fips 199.

343
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,320
um looking at the CIA not the

344
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,500
intelligence Community CIA CIA Triad uh

345
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,180
you'll examine for each one of those

346
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,579
pieces if

347
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,220
um if a breach occurs

348
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,620
um if focused on that particular item

349
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,500
what's the impact going to be and fifth

350
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,899
199 gives you some guidance on how to

351
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,160
figure out

352
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,839
you know what what classifies as

353
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,360
moderate so on and so forth one thing to

354
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,339
note on that is you use the high water

355
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,700
mark So if two out of those three you

356
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,420
judge the impact as low and one is

357
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,700
judged as high you have to categorize

358
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,079
the system as high impact

359
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,700
I mentioned there were a couple of other

360
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,200
things

361
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,300
um talk very briefly about fedramp

362
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,680
tailored

363
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
um we're really focused on low moderate

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,120
and high for the purposes of this talk

365
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,700
um Federate tailored is for very low

366
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,899
risk

367
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,860
um systems that can't contain any pii

368
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,560
um technically and and they can only be

369
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,060
SAS offerings

370
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,120
um technically with Frederick Taylor

371
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,579
you're required to follow all of the

372
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,560
controls for bedramp low however you can

373
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
self-attest to the majority of them

374
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,540
there are between 29 and 51 that you

375
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,860
will need to have an outside party

376
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,920
validate your compliance with and that's

377
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,680
really dependent on number of factors in

378
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,940
terms of things like where are you

379
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,519
hosting the the application those sorts

380
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,760
of things

381
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,160
um

382
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,959
Wendy

383
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm going to hop in here uh because I

384
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
actually went from federamp tsoc too and

385
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,779
I did my first stock too audit I was

386
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,699
like what is this nonsense where I get

387
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,560
to tell you guys what my audit scope is

388
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,420
that is not a thing that exists in

389
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,800
federampland

390
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,899
um if the systems have data that need to

391
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,760
meet a certain classification congrats

392
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,220
that's in scope there is no real wiggle

393
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,959
room on that unless I could redesign

394
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,560
your systems it's mandatory stock two uh

395
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
one of my friends always jokes that you

396
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
could do a sock 2 audit a cocktail

397
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,760
napkin if you really wanted to if you

398
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,959
really wanted to pay an auditor to do

399
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,100
that for you

400
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,600
um and then I'm going to turn over to

401
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,139
Shay to talk about uh fedramp data in

402
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,839
the US I believe the answer is no it

403
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,040
doesn't have to be but you're going to

404
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,959
be in a world of pain

405
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,019
um thanks buddy yeah so and this is a

406
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,639
question I get a lot is you know do we

407
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,440
have to have everything hosted in the

408
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,639
U.S

409
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,800
um if we're hosting with AWS do we have

410
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,260
to only use U.S availability zones that

411
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,339
sort of thing

412
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,920
the technical answer is no you can host

413
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,660
it anywhere

414
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,060
specific agencies may have their own

415
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,519
requirements about where it's hosted and

416
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,320
the other place that hosting location

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,620
will figure it for fedramp is depending

418
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,000
on

419
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,019
um Staffing used by your provider as to

420
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,459
whether or not they're US citizens or

421
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,620
not and again there's a good deal of

422
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,899
flexibility technically in fedramp on

423
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:25,920
that

424
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,940
um

425
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,759
but individual agencies may have

426
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,100
specific requirements about Staffing as

427
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,279
well

428
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,839
um and the other thing about fed ramp is

429
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,779
I really hope you like paperwork

430
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,720
um ephedrent pmo is taking some steps to

431
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,959
provide some degree of automation for

432
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,519
um your assessment package and those

433
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,040
sorts of things but the general rule of

434
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
thumb that I've experienced is about a

435
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,959
thousand pages for all of your

436
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,759
documentation for a moderate impact

437
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,199
system

438
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,300
um a number of years ago I was working

439
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,600
for a cloud service provider and

440
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,040
um we were putting our authorization

441
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,779
package together and you'll often go

442
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,560
through

443
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,259
several revisions of it and the

444
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,060
sponsoring agency in question who shall

445
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,980
remain nameless

446
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,740
um insisted on

447
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,540
paper copies of the authorization

448
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,980
package

449
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,519
and in triplicate for each revision so

450
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,220
every two weeks or so during the process

451
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,040
I would go to my office with a

452
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,560
rollerboard suitcase I'd fill it up with

453
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,740
binders take the train into DC drop it

454
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,300
off the agency and then leave the agency

455
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,258
with an empty suitcase

456
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,540
it's not at all sketchy no not at all

457
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,740
um

458
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,620
so what if I told you fedramp is only

459
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,040
the beginning

460
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,720
um cmmc is in the they've been in the

461
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,579
news a lot recently

462
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,100
um it has been somewhat in flux

463
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,199
um it is certainly not something instead

464
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,079
of fed ramp but handles somewhat similar

465
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,000
but but different materials specifically

466
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,459
for DOD contractors

467
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,900
um that are handling any sort of

468
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,599
controlled unclassified information

469
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,780
um based on Nest 800 171 in a lot of

470
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,240
cases contractors can self-attest to

471
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,039
compliance with that

472
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,559
um as I said been in flux

473
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,839
knock on I think this is wood knock on

474
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,780
wood that is settling down I can

475
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,880
certainly talk about that more after the

476
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,140
talk or something like that if someone

477
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,559
wants to

478
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,400
and the other kind of other piece that I

479
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,140
want to talk about is uh what's referred

480
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,440
to as fed ramp plus which is used for

481
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,000
cloud service providers that are going

482
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,179
to be providing services to the dod

483
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,340
um and you can look at that somewhat as

484
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,100
a overlay on top of bedramp

485
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,280
um the dod doesn't really like it when

486
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,559
you say overlay on top of the on top of

487
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,940
fedrent but I'm going to go ahead and

488
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,260
say it

489
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,500
um so it start it it uses numbered

490
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,059
impact levels

491
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,700
um there is a reason why there's no

492
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,820
level one and there's no level three

493
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,400
um they merged levels and decided not to

494
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,740
remember it's the short version so

495
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,400
um impact level two is equivalent to

496
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,080
fedramp moderate satisfying Federate

497
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
moderate technically satisfies the

498
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,600
requirements of impact level two

499
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,380
um

500
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,820
and

501
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,820
um il-4 again there's a correspondence

502
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,360
between that and uh and fedramp high or

503
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,580
you can use something that satisfies

504
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,340
aisle two and then add on specific

505
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,100
controls related to kui and then you'll

506
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,860
get more and more rigorous as as you go

507
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,799
up to impact level six

508
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,640
can you touch on what MCI and NS says uh

509
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
I don't remember what MCI is

510
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,179
um

511
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,000
and um NSS is referring to National

512
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,220
Security information basically that is

513
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,140
not yet at the

514
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,520
um it is National Security information

515
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,160
but in this context it's not yet at a

516
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,760
classified level

517
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,039
so

518
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,900
um emerging from that little rabbit hole

519
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,000
that I just took us down we'll return to

520
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,620
fedramp

521
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,559
um so I already talked about the the

522
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,179
paperwork burden you're likely to deal

523
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,380
with

524
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,600
um so talking about uh preparation

525
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,039
there's really

526
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,140
um two ways you can do that you can run

527
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,700
it yourself

528
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,539
um

529
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,360
if you have experience in the area I

530
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,980
think that's great

531
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,179
um

532
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,980
mandatory disclaimers that I work for

533
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,480
Professional Services Company we do

534
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,760
federal Consulting so I've invested

535
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,340
interest obviously in people doing

536
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,500
um getting outside assistance it can be

537
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,179
very valuable if you're limited in terms

538
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,580
of resources and expertise

539
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,039
that's all I'm going to say on that

540
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,880
um

541
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,059
so I mentioned before you have the joint

542
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,679
Advisory Board which can issue you a

543
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,080
provisional ATO or you have an agency

544
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
authorization

545
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,700
um with the joint Advisory Board issuing

546
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,980
a provisional ATO it doesn't

547
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,020
specifically authorize you to work with

548
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,860
any specific agencies the idea is the

549
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,539
Joiner Advisory Board which is made up

550
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,179
of csos from various agencies within the

551
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,620
federal government that sort of thing

552
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,780
has evaluated your authorization package

553
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,260
has said this looks good and we're

554
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,320
attesting to potential agency buyers

555
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,140
that we think this is this is reasonable

556
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,179
to to use

557
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,700
um there is also a program called

558
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,039
fedramp Ready which there are a couple

559
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,320
of different contexts you can use that

560
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,860
and get into that in just a second that

561
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,500
is not showing that you are fully

562
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
compliant but that an outside party has

563
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,840
evaluated things and is confident you

564
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
could make it through the FED ramp

565
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,580
process

566
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:59,880
um rather than Reinventing the wheel I

567
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,559
took this in the next slide from the

568
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,600
Federate pmo website

569
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,200
um

570
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,940
this is stepping through what the

571
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
workflow is like for the job

572
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,080
authorization process so

573
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,559
um the jab only selects a small number

574
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,340
of csps to go through the process each

575
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,140
year so you have to basically make a

576
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,419
business case to the jab here's why we

577
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,039
should do this rather than an agency

578
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,900
authorization

579
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,080
um that is typically based on whatever

580
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
our offering is is likely to be utilized

581
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,820
by a wide range of agencies within the

582
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,620
federal government

583
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,500
um you're then under

584
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,539
um under a jab authorization process

585
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,760
you're required to get a Readiness

586
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,860
assessment which is the veteran ready

587
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,679
piece that I mentioned um earlier on

588
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,140
CE that's done you're listed on the

589
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,559
federal Marketplace as ready

590
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,840
um which can be used to talk to agencies

591
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,000
about you know we're moving along in the

592
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,679
process

593
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,200
um following that you will have a full

594
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,059
security assessment

595
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,520
um security assessments are done by uh

596
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,100
one of a group of um licensed outside

597
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
parties referred to as three paos third

598
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
party assessment organizations and you

599
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,880
will then put together your security

600
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,039
authorization package which is that

601
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
thousand Pages for a moderate

602
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,299
authorization I mentioned before and

603
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,820
then you'll go through the authorization

604
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,039
process with the jab which is them

605
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,860
evaluating your authorization package

606
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,539
um looking at you know communicating

607
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,400
with you about any remediation you need

608
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,500
to do that sort of thing

609
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,679
um and then you'll be listed as having a

610
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,600
provisional ATO on the veteran

611
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,100
Marketplace

612
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,659
and then you move on to continuous

613
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,360
monitoring which put a pin in that we'll

614
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,740
come back to that in a little bit

615
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,260
um so for agency authorization it's a

616
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,059
lot of similarity here

617
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,940
um one thing to call out is fedramp

618
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,760
ready is not required for an agency

619
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
authorization

620
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,299
um it is strongly encouraged

621
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,320
um

622
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,900
that can back in my day when I started

623
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,440
fedramp there was no fedramp ready

624
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,000
um having gone through the authorization

625
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,780
process multiple times I would strongly

626
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,520
encourage doing doing fedramp ready

627
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
because not only is it going to

628
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,780
demonstrate as I said before that you

629
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,400
there's some confidence you can make

630
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,900
into the process

631
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,020
but it also gives you a good indicator

632
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,539
of where things stand for you and the

633
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,799
sort of things you might need to

634
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,960
implement those sorts of things

635
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,679
um

636
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,559
so then again you'll go through a full

637
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,299
security assessment the security

638
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,779
assessment for a jab authorization and

639
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,179
an agency authorization is identical no

640
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,820
difference there and then much like the

641
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,200
jab

642
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,860
um evaluating your authorization package

643
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,480
the sponsor initial sponsoring agency

644
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,720
will do the same thing and then um issue

645
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,620
you a ATO and then you again you'll move

646
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,000
on to

647
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,340
continuous monitor

648
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,820
so looking at fed ramp low

649
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,659
um

650
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:13,080
there are roughly 125 controls in

651
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,059
fedramp low currently

652
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,960
um going to provide a two examples here

653
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
um so requirement that you provide

654
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,179
incident response training to users in

655
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,159
your organization

656
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,559
um you get to pick what how frequently

657
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,480
you provide training and um

658
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,120
and you also get to pick how soon after

659
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,340
they start in an appropriate role you

660
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,559
have to provide training I called out

661
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,159
ir3 which is incident response testing

662
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,740
to mention that for fedramp Lowe there's

663
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,419
no requirement for incident response

664
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,900
testing this will come up later slides

665
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,240
um so as Wendy mentioned earlier in a

666
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
stock too you're going to need to handle

667
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,260
vulnerability management

668
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,580
um you're still going to have to handle

669
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,799
that but it's more stringent more

670
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,360
rigorous in terms of the sort of things

671
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,400
you need to do about vulnerability

672
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
management

673
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,320
um again same thing with um

674
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,419
with monitoring and alerting more

675
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,720
rigorous requirements and your Access

676
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,059
Control requirements are kind of a step

677
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,159
up from what the specific requirements

678
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,919
are for sock 2.

679
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,039
uh moving on to fedramp moderate we have

680
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,440
almost more than doubled the number of

681
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,000
controls

682
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,620
um and uh ir3 is now is now in place and

683
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,179
requiring you to be incident response

684
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,559
testing

685
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,539
um again you get to define the frequency

686
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:42,720
as long as it's at least annually and

687
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,440
um

688
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,779
and you get to determine what sort of

689
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,880
testing you want to do

690
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
um one note here as we've indicated is

691
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,220
if it's a jab authorization the jab has

692
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,260
to approve whatever your test plans are

693
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,720
for that process

694
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,400
um and we're starting to then with

695
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,960
moderate get into a good deal of

696
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,559
requirement for automation of processes

697
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,179
moving on to fedramp high we've jumped

698
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:13,200
up to four around 425 controls

699
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,480
um again more rigorous um there's a lot

700
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,340
more requirements for functional testing

701
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,039
rather than tabletop testing

702
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,380
um as we see in ir3 now the change has

703
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,760
been

704
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,580
um you have to do testing at least every

705
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,740
six months and once a year at least once

706
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,620
a year you have to do functional testing

707
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,720
um and again

708
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,159
um the

709
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,720
um if you're doing a job authorization

710
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,240
the jab has to approve any test plans

711
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,020
you're using

712
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,020
and I'm going to turn it over to Wendy

713
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,940
all right so I'm going to talk to you a

714
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,860
little bit about how you go from a sock

715
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,140
2 to fedramp

716
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,580
um I'm going to warn you it's a lot of

717
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,360
work

718
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,860
especially if you've only done a sock 2

719
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,799
type 1 this is a huge amount of maturity

720
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,380
uplift

721
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,860
uh sock 2 is not the most prescriptive

722
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,080
control framework out there a good

723
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,460
auditor will make sure that you're

724
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,520
following good Cloud security practices

725
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,380
but you can always justify to them and

726
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,000
depending on who the auditor is they'll

727
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,679
give you more or less leeway with your

728
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,480
control set that's something that I talk

729
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,640
a lot to organizations about and when I

730
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,799
interview Auditors I will sometimes say

731
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,360
I'm coming in with my own control set

732
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,460
and I am not an auditor so I can't

733
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,500
attest that these fully implement the

734
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,799
cloud service or the csps but you know

735
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,360
I'd like to use my control set versus

736
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,980
sometimes Auditors will come in and be

737
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,840
like this is what we need to see you

738
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
doing before we are going to give you a

739
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,500
sock 2 certification

740
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,720
um so that varies a lot the idea with

741
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
fedramp the 3pio is this much more

742
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,600
standardized everybody knows what the

743
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,220
controls are you're not playing games

744
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,960
with controls

745
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,520
um federal office government only versus

746
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,080
the stock too really is an Enterprise

747
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
sales tool

748
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,559
you're doing that because you want to

749
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,240
bypass vendor security questionnaires

750
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,760
where you have a sales contract

751
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
requirements and so forth that you have

752
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,179
a stock 2 or a ISO 27 000 certification

753
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,620
stock 2 really looks at how your

754
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,720
organization functions are you briefing

755
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
your board of directors do the managers

756
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,679
communicate goals down to your employees

757
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,179
fedramp doesn't completely ignore

758
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,580
management but it doesn't really care in

759
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,820
the same way that sock 2 does so a lot

760
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,460
of those pieces of evidence you collect

761
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,200
for your sock too like I have to pull

762
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,480
slide decks from quarterly briefing of

763
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,659
our CTO down to our developers to show

764
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:34,980
like what our goals are for the next

765
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,899
quarter I would never use those for a

766
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:39,059
fedramp thing maybe for risk management

767
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,100
a little bit but it's not in the same

768
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,020
way

769
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,980
um

770
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,279
really fedramp is very prescriptive on

771
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
the technical side for a sock 2 I can

772
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
decide if I'm going to do Access Control

773
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
reviews only annually I will tell you

774
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,840
when I get a stock T report and it says

775
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,039
that the reviews were only done annually

776
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,260
I got a heck of a race eyebrow

777
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,279
um and when they say they had no

778
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,659
security incidents over the last year

779
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,039
I'm going to do even more of a raised

780
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,480
eyebrow at what their monitoring and

781
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,340
alerting is because stock 2 says you

782
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,659
need some but it doesn't tell you what

783
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,480
federamp is going to be very very strict

784
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,179
about what happens there and you need to

785
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,840
show a much more rigorous sort of stuff

786
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,580
there than you can do for a stock too so

787
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,199
it's going to be a big maturity uplift

788
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,679
so about that government only thing

789
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,840
um so fedramp is designed to be used by

790
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,700
federal agencies

791
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,659
um and he is officially from the federal

792
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,140
government point of view limited to that

793
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,120
um when once you have your authorization

794
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,520
and you're looking to work with a new

795
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,220
agency they will request a copy of your

796
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,520
authorization package from OMB Max

797
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,779
um only

798
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:52,919
um

799
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,200
only existing agencies and their

800
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,779
contractors can estab can request that

801
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,299
so if it's random private company you're

802
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,399
trying to do business with they can't

803
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,440
um they can't request

804
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,779
that

805
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,179
we will

806
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,120
okay cool

807
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,000
um that all that said you as a cloud

808
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,159
service provider control that

809
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,840
authorization package and you have your

810
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,539
own copy of it so if you're looking to

811
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,480
sell the same sort of service to

812
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,000
um to a private company

813
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,700
um you can you're free to provide them a

814
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,620
copy of your authorization package if

815
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,480
you want if it will facilitate the sales

816
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,919
process

817
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,039
um the one caveat there is going back to

818
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,380
the issue of what data is being stored

819
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,399
where

820
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,960
um if you're in a situation where you're

821
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,399
doing that you're really going to want

822
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,220
separate enclaves for data between your

823
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,320
federal clients and your Private

824
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,240
Industry clients

825
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,520
um going down a very small Rabbit Hole

826
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,320
here there is something called State

827
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,200
ramp which is intended for cloud service

828
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,480
providers looking to provide services to

829
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,820
State and Municipal governments

830
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,159
um it is based very heavily off of

831
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,880
fedramp it's run by a non-profit

832
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,500
organization

833
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,360
um rather than any of the individual

834
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,640
state governments that sort of thing

835
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,460
um State ramp is a very new not every

836
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,320
state uses it

837
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,120
um certainly not every municipality is

838
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,880
going to use it

839
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,519
so we mentioned continuous monitoring as

840
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,740
being one of the big pieces with bedramp

841
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,980
and this is also one of the things that

842
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,539
in my experience has tripped people up

843
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,460
the most in terms of maintaining

844
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,320
authorizations

845
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,460
um so

846
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,220
pre-2010

847
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,080
um before they started developing

848
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,580
fedramp

849
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,980
um you would receive a

850
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,679
uthorization to operate not through the

851
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,299
FED rank program but from the individual

852
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,360
agency and three years later you would

853
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,640
get assessed again and you would get

854
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,200
accredited

855
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,559
um technically speaking nothing had to

856
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,799
happen in those three years

857
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,340
um

858
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,279
with the release of fedramp it they

859
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,140
introduced the concept of continuous

860
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,919
monitoring so you receive a

861
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,620
authorization to operate and then there

862
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,360
are a large number of controls that are

863
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,279
related to how are you maintaining the

864
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,419
system

865
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,220
um those need to be done on an ongoing

866
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,159
basis you need to provide updates to

867
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,220
that uh on a monthly basis uh depending

868
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,620
on what the information is and you also

869
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,640
get periodic assessments so the first

870
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,919
two years after your initial uh

871
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,039
authorization you get assessed against a

872
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,779
sample of the applicable fed ramp

873
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,659
controls and then in the third year you

874
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,240
basically get an authorization

875
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,830
assessment from scratch

876
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,340
[Applause]

877
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,019
um

878
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,200
so what do you need to do with that

879
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,860
um

880
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,220
the uh fedrent pmo requires

881
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,380
um within your authorization package

882
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,059
what's called a continuous monitoring

883
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,760
plan that provides details on exactly

884
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,500
how you're going to meet all of the

885
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,659
requirements of continuous monitoring

886
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,419
and um and how you're going to maintain

887
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,039
that over the course of your

888
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,899
authorization

889
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,120
um kind of high level pieces you'll

890
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,679
you'll need to deal with their

891
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,539
vulnerability management threat

892
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,380
monitoring and change control

893
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,940
you'll be reporting that as I mentioned

894
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,760
earlier on a monthly basis the other

895
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,799
piece in there is What's called the poem

896
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:35,460
or a plan of actions and Milestones and

897
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,340
that's that's really listing all of the

898
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,380
items where you're not compliant where

899
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,539
things need to be remediated what the

900
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,519
risk is how you're going to remediate

901
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,919
that any compensating controls you have

902
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,919
in place until you can get it remediated

903
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,140
um and all of that will be reviewed on

904
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,000
an ongoing basis

905
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,220
um by different parties depending on on

906
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,919
which sort of authorization you have

907
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,080
so

908
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,139
um

909
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,899
so our advice really is to start with

910
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,440
bedramp low low is a lot fewer controls

911
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,960
I totally understand low medium highs

912
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,639
basically driven by what data you have

913
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,440
in your system from the agency but if

914
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,820
you have it all flexibility you want to

915
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,040
start with low and you should have a

916
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,440
pretty mature sock 2 program you need to

917
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,480
already be automating your evidence

918
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,000
collection you need to be on the higher

919
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,418
stringent end of what's happening with

920
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,460
your controls like you if you're still

921
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,260
only doing annual Access Control reviews

922
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,719
you are not ready for fedramp even

923
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,359
fedramplow you need to have a pretty

924
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,359
mature incident response program have

925
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,239
really dialed in your uh your monitoring

926
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,280
your security monitoring program and so

927
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,739
forth and you should know uh what sort

928
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,480
of risks your business faces and be

929
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
tracking them

930
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,599
um and be doing more for vulnerability

931
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,280
management than just like oh I just have

932
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,020
depend about Auto merging and stuff

933
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
you're going to be very behind in the

934
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,460
paperwork and you need to have a pretty

935
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,800
good pen test happening so not just you

936
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,560
know oh we hired you know a Joe Hacker

937
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,140
off the street to poke at our web app

938
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,619
for for 48 hours because when the 3pio

939
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,900
comes in they have some requirements how

940
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,040
they're going to do the pen test and how

941
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,740
they're going to be looking for this and

942
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,560
to give a little bit of a look ahead

943
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,720
sock 2 evidence collection varies a lot

944
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,400
by the auditor but it's usually do you

945
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,780
have screenshots where you're showing

946
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,400
dates and so forth to show things happen

947
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,020
it's going to be a big change when you

948
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,520
get in the room of the federal auditor

949
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,680
3pios have a whole system that they are

950
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,859
required to follow by the pmo

951
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,060
so where does this leave us

952
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,020
um

953
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,000
we yes we were just talking about

954
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,320
differences but we'll talk about

955
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,359
similarities somewhat

956
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,040
um

957
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,920
at a high level both sock 2 and fedramp

958
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,520
cover many of the same high-level areas

959
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,820
um they both require you set up a an

960
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,560
organized information security program

961
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,680
and they both involve some third party

962
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,500
assessing that program with differences

963
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,800
obviously between a stock 2 auditor and

964
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
a 3pao as as Wendy just described

965
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,859
um other similarities

966
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,560
I really hope you like Microsoft Excel

967
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,119
because you're going to be living in it

968
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,599
a lot

969
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,140
um

970
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,599
still definitely some differences

971
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,859
um you know as we've talked about

972
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,380
earlier at a high level they're they're

973
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,599
definitely meant for very different

974
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,460
audiences

975
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,839
um

976
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,220
you know fed rank is much more

977
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,520
prescriptive than uh sock 2 is

978
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,180
um

979
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,400
and uh we you know talked about kind of

980
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
differences between the approach of a

981
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,859
3pao and a CPA auditor

982
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,200
um and as Wendy described earlier

983
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,760
um your evidence collection strategies

984
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,380
are going to have to be very different

985
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,300
between the two

986
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,160
um a

987
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,140
look

988
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,720
so what happens a lot with the stock 2

989
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,579
for evidence especially in pandemic

990
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,359
times

991
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,240
um is I get a tool from the auditor and

992
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,859
they have all my controls and they have

993
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,720
an Evidence ask and I go collect

994
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
screenshots and upload them their images

995
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,940
I sometimes do screen share they

996
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,859
sometimes capture them but mostly you're

997
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,079
taking your own screenshots uh I would

998
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,640
love to see someone try that with a 3pio

999
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,520
they'd be like yeah LOL no

1000
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,700
um I haven't done a fedramp 3paio audit

1001
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,140
since before the pandemic so I'm not

1002
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,760
sure how a little I assume it's a little

1003
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,619
bit more virtual now but they would want

1004
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,540
to sit in the room demonstrate the

1005
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,280
process to me can you take that

1006
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,020
screenshot I'm taking that screenshot

1007
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,020
let's get that log they do not trust you

1008
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,540
to just upload your own screenshots to

1009
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,500
it it's

1010
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,720
there's much more Integrity sort of

1011
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,520
controls that happen during the audit

1012
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
yeah just kind of one little side note

1013
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,160
on that

1014
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,660
um the first

1015
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,180
uh fed ramp assessment I went through as

1016
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,119
a cloud service provider there was at

1017
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,579
least a week-long period where literally

1018
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,160
eight hours a day every day

1019
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,540
sitting in a conference room with the

1020
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,440
auditor

1021
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,020
preparing live screenshots basically

1022
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,320
[Music]

1023
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
um

1024
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
so

1025
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,260
um what are some of the strategies for

1026
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,500
achieving fedramp authorization

1027
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,260
um prepare early as we talked about now

1028
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,440
um you know given things like the uh

1029
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,359
paperwork burden we talked about and

1030
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,760
having to schedule the 3pao that sort of

1031
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,859
thing what you don't want to do is be in

1032
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,540
a situation where you have an agency

1033
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,300
that says we'd like to work with you but

1034
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,300
we need you to start in a month

1035
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,480
um it's not it's not going to happen

1036
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,920
um

1037
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,180
generally fedramp fed ramp moderate is

1038
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,540
if everything falls into place right

1039
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,880
um about a year-long process start to

1040
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,260
finish

1041
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,260
um you won't identify resources that you

1042
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,900
have resources that you need this ties

1043
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,760
into kind of what I talked about before

1044
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
in terms of do you want this to be

1045
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,119
self-run or do you want to bring in

1046
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,579
outside services to help you prepare and

1047
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,740
get through the process and if you're an

1048
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,540
organization that doesn't have a lot of

1049
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,520
available resources to cover that you

1050
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,400
may want to explore that that Avenue

1051
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,060
um

1052
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,160
and looking at what sort of mapping and

1053
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,280
crosswalk you can do of um of controls

1054
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,440
for controls from stock 2 versus

1055
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,960
controls from fedramp there's a good

1056
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,480
deal of freely available information out

1057
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,460
there about that I believe

1058
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,760
the aicpa specifically has a sock 2 to

1059
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,280
nist 853 crosswalk that you can get for

1060
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,660
free

1061
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,380
um

1062
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,020
and then there may be some areas but

1063
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,940
you're somewhat Limited in this in terms

1064
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,400
of if there's any evidence you can reuse

1065
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,980
some of it you can

1066
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,900
um there's a good deal of policy

1067
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,960
controls in fedramp you're obviously the

1068
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,940
the 3pio is not going to ask you to

1069
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,040
write the policy on the spot so you can

1070
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,319
use the same policy in most cases if

1071
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,700
it's written properly that you've been

1072
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,819
using for sock 2.

1073
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:16,920
and with that

1074
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,940
we are at questions

1075
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
so what is the strategy for

1076
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,079
what would be the strategy if you don't

1077
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,720
have a customer that's willing to wait a

1078
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,440
year

1079
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,079
or you have a federal contractor who

1080
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,240
also is in a month long or a six month

1081
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,339
long procurement cycle how can you even

1082
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,520
go about getting started Etc

1083
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,160
so they're they're really kind of two

1084
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,839
answers to that question depending on

1085
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,660
exactly who thinks oh sorry the question

1086
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,680
was

1087
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,740
um if you don't if you don't have an um

1088
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,180
agency

1089
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,339
um identified or you have an agency and

1090
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,800
they're like well we need it in you know

1091
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,079
six months or something like that

1092
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,579
um

1093
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,800
what I'd advise in that case is is going

1094
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,960
back and looking at fedramp ready

1095
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,280
um you know you've still got a good deal

1096
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,680
of work to do after Federate ready but

1097
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,140
if you're in a position now with the

1098
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,480
former where it's you don't have an

1099
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,280
agency identified

1100
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,079
um going through the federal ready

1101
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,540
process will give you a good Watermark

1102
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,940
of how much further you need to go and

1103
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,380
you'll also be listed on the federal

1104
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,200
Marketplace as Federate ready which can

1105
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,480
be used to communicate to agencies to

1106
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,980
say you know

1107
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,020
we we're not all the way there yet but

1108
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,780
we've you know the 3pao is confident we

1109
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,160
couldn't make it

1110
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,020
all the way to you know whatever sort of

1111
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,920
authorization it is

1112
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,560
say thanks for doing the presentation

1113
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,480
um what's the longest Federal amp

1114
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,099
authorization you've been involved with

1115
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,380
and what could have been done to smooth

1116
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,220
out the process

1117
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,500
you I'm guessing you may have a longer I

1118
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,480
might have a longer one um I came in in

1119
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,380
the middle so I uh worked on some that

1120
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,339
were extremely extensive um bringing in

1121
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:28,020
so basically there was

1122
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,020
um most of the applications on the SAS

1123
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,119
were already authorized and we were

1124
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,339
uplifting to high and bringing in some

1125
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:39,300
new ones well over two years I would say

1126
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,260
I think

1127
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,819
um

1128
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:44,339
I say I feel like I need to give Shay

1129
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,260
like a shot of whiskey or bourbon before

1130
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,819
I really asked him he has better War

1131
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:51,200
Stories than I do on some of these

1132
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,400
um but as I guess Wendy actually wins on

1133
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,020
the longest one I think the longest one

1134
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,119
that I've been involved with was about

1135
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,619
18 months

1136
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,500
um that was a it was a federal of high

1137
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,079
authorization but it was a relatively

1138
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,880
simple

1139
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,680
authorization in terms of kind of number

1140
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,839
of moving pieces that that sort of thing

1141
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,940
and they were also the other thing we

1142
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,339
didn't really talk about is

1143
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,619
um if you are hosting whatever service

1144
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,160
you're looking to provide on a cloud

1145
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,380
provider that already has fedramp

1146
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,780
authorization at the right level you can

1147
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,300
actually leverage a large number of

1148
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,480
their implementations of of the controls

1149
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,280
which will then you know drastically

1150
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,619
reduce depending on how many it is your

1151
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,839
the applicable control set and make it a

1152
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:38,640
lot easier in the in the case of the

1153
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,740
federal High authorization that I worked

1154
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,300
on that was about 18 months that's one

1155
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,700
of the reasons we were able to we were

1156
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,440
able to achieve it in that sort of time

1157
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,740
frame

1158
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,980
all right thank you for the talk nice to

1159
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,060
see you both

1160
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,520
um oh can you characterize the

1161
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,800
difference in kanman between moderate

1162
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,660
and high what are the big uplifts to the

1163
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,579
kanman process

1164
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,599
when you get to hide

1165
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,400
I will be completely transparent and say

1166
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,760
not off the top of my head

1167
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,099
um there there is a great deal of

1168
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,740
commonality there and really the biggest

1169
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,380
differences are going to be less that

1170
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,500
you need a different kanman program and

1171
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,079
more that there may be more controls

1172
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,599
applicable but like exactly what the

1173
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,640
Delta is I I don't know off the top of

1174
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,900
my head

1175
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,700
one thing that does sort of touch on

1176
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,140
that and say I don't know these numbers

1177
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,240
off top of my head when you Thrice

1178
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,619
you're allowed to have a certain number

1179
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,440
of like essentially open poem issues so

1180
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,000
like you know maybe a patch is not

1181
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,160
applied um or a common one that I tell

1182
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,780
people to take is as a requirement to

1183
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,339
lock out accounts and the wrong password

1184
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,800
has been put in uh 10 times and it's

1185
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,079
like people will just go fuzz the

1186
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,060
sysadmin accounts lock out the sys

1187
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,280
admins and then go do their nonsense and

1188
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,980
so I'm like you do not ever want to you

1189
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,119
know really be following that control in

1190
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,260
that way

1191
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,520
um and so there's only a certain number

1192
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,839
you can do and the number that you can

1193
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,940
have open at authorization affects the

1194
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,800
number you can keep open later

1195
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,839
so you're sort of locked to a certain

1196
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,339
percentage of where you were at

1197
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,380
authorizations like I think I'm going to

1198
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,339
make these numbers up Center number

1199
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,960
specifics if you got authorize a five

1200
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,180
you can never have more than seven open

1201
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,680
and so kanban is going to be doing that

1202
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,060
you're going to have to patch things to

1203
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,800
keep your number of open issues below

1204
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,900
that seven number and so forth and what

1205
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,700
that number is gets smaller as you go

1206
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,680
from low to medium to high so that feeds

1207
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,720
into it the specific numbers I do not

1208
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,180
remember I would have to look on the pmo

1209
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,040
website for it

1210
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,240
in

1211
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
I also don't know the numbers but one

1212
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,260
thing I wanted to add was

1213
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,140
um in terms of the poem specifically

1214
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,240
um you know as I mentioned earlier on

1215
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,980
one of the goals with federamp is for

1216
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,599
this to really be reusable

1217
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,819
authorizations essentially

1218
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,920
um that said as I talked about earlier

1219
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,700
agencies are free to have different risk

1220
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,160
appetites different interpretations of

1221
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,540
what they want so one agency may say you

1222
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,660
know these poem items are okay with the

1223
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,460
compensating controls you have in and

1224
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,099
another agency may say no you know if

1225
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:18,480
we're going to give you an authorization

1226
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,940
you have to fix these things before the

1227
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,480
authorization

1228
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,780
so so my uh my company doesn't do any

1229
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,460
business with agencies but it does do a

1230
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,020
lot of business with or tries to do

1231
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,180
business with contractors that do do

1232
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,640
business with agencies and they ask us a

1233
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,619
lot oh are we've had or we've had rapid

1234
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:48,420
client from this process if we're not

1235
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,280
doing business with an agency there's no

1236
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,740
way we can be Frederick like no the no

1237
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,819
one would give us that that

1238
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,440
certification

1239
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,000
what should we do and what are these

1240
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,040
like contractors actually asking for and

1241
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
what do they need from us yeah

1242
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,260
so and and you're not in in those

1243
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,440
um in

1244
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,960
it or anything like that

1245
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,560
correct

1246
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,000
sorry what

1247
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,280
so it depends is the short answer but

1248
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,880
you may well actually need a Fed rip

1249
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,319
authorization

1250
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,059
um you know kind of abstracting this out

1251
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:31,319
a little bit because Wendy talked about

1252
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,940
using sock 2 kind of in the sales

1253
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,680
process and you know for identifying a

1254
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,359
baseline you know one of the other

1255
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,460
things you could look at doing if it's

1256
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,260
determined that you don't actually need

1257
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,300
a fedramp authorization but you're

1258
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,359
getting these requests from customers is

1259
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,740
to look at doing the state ramp

1260
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,960
authorization well you're not

1261
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,140
necessarily looking to sell to

1262
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,700
um state governments or that sort of

1263
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,460
thing really anyone can go through that

1264
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,819
process

1265
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,940
foreign

1266
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,540
it's it's hard to tell

1267
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,200
um

1268
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,960
you know the the question was

1269
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,220
um you know could you could you go to

1270
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,500
the federal pmo or the jab and say you

1271
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,200
know we have this request can we go

1272
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,720
through the federal process it's hard to

1273
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,559
tell the other thing I will say is

1274
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,700
this is kind of an end run but you could

1275
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,079
go through the fedramp ready process now

1276
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:44,819
you're limited in how long you can

1277
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,520
maintain fed ramp ready but you could it

1278
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,720
obviously doesn't give you the same

1279
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,940
degree of assessment but you might

1280
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,859
because anyone can go through that with

1281
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,140
no sponsorship you might be able to do

1282
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,059
that to provide some sort of

1283
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,059
demonstration to those clients that you

1284
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:01,619
at least know what's going on with

1285
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:04,140
vetramp

1286
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,460
so I'm going to throw out a really

1287
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,240
stupid idea uh sock 2 does give you a

1288
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,680
huge amount of flexibility of controls

1289
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,660
and I know some people who got tired of

1290
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,520
doing High trust and did a sock 2 with

1291
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,040
very high trusty type controls you can

1292
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,859
basically do a sock too with 853

1293
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,800
controls

1294
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,319
um it would be dumb it would be a lot of

1295
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,180
Overkill you're not getting the same

1296
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,220
level of auditing I mean I'm sure

1297
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,599
there's Auditors would be happy to say

1298
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,640
like sure we'll be super stringent

1299
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,020
um but that would be a dumb sales thing

1300
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,160
you could try to do

1301
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,319
thanks a lot um we'll both be around for

1302
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,000
the rest of B sites

1303
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,040
if uh you know if you think of anything

1304
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,780
later please feel free to come find us

1305
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,380
thanks
