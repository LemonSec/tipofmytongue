which is the company that i established

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
for my freelance pen testing

i also work as the ctf design lead for

ithacasec and that's in upstate new york

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
so quick note before we begin i'm going

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
to be covering a lot of different

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
aspects on creating the business and

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
talking about freelance pen testing but

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,560
it's important to know i'm not a lawyer

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
this isn't legal advice this isn't

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,599
financial advice

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
uh you're responsible to do your own due

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
diligence and understand what works for

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
you in your individual individual

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
circumstances so just take that into

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
mind as we move forward

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
so if you're interested in pursuing the

88
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,840
freelance work there's a few important

89
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,400
questions that you need to answer

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
and these are to kind of make sure that

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
you're ready

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
to jump into freelancing

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
so first off why do you want to do it

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,799
why do you want to become a freelance

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,159
pen tester

96
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,440
your answer is going to be unique to

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
yourself for me i had the opportunity to

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
work on the ncaa cyber games but i was a

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
full-time consultant at the same time

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
and

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
there wasn't enough time for me to do

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
full-time job for that the part-time job

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,239
for the education and then still have

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
time for family friends

105
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,640
hobbies things like that so

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
freelancing was an opportunity

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
for me

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
to pursue all those things while

109
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,879
making it under my terms

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,159
but for you i mean there's obvious

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
benefits if you're interested in

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
freelancing uh some of those benefits

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
are you know you get to decide when you

114
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,519
work how much you work who you're

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,760
working for what you're doing

116
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,799
um

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,319
big benefits but there's downsides to

118
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,480
consider too you're going to have to

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,959
make sure that you can

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
get through the times when there's not

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,759
enough work available

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,720
how are you going to handle those

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
situations

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
uh you may be working with clients that

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
you don't necessarily like or get along

126
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
with but they provide a lot of work um

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,680
things like that you go you have to be

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,160
ready for those things

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
and you have to find the work it's not

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
going to be provided to you you know

131
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
unlike with a regular job you have

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
tasking that gets presented to you have

133
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
you uh to have you do

134
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,080
not the case with freelancing you got to

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,280
do a lot of work

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
to get that work

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
so if you've decided okay that's all

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
fine i still want to do it um

139
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
let's talk about you know preparation

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
if you have experience as a pen tester

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
you probably have an idea of what your

142
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,880
strengths are you know what kind of

143
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,320
tests that you can do what kind of work

144
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
you can do

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,919
um so identify those make sure you know

146
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,680
that you've established

147
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
what you're able to offer you know are

148
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
you an app tester do you work in cloud

149
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,720
environments

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
uh do you like breaking medical devices

151
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
this helps you establish

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
you know your client base who you're

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,759
going to go after to get some of that

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
work

155
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
for me i mainly do web app pen testing i

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
do external pen testing there's a lot of

157
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
work available in those areas

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
so depending on where your expertise is

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
you have to identify how much work

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,080
there is

161
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
to pursue

162
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,759
outside of you know the specific

163
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,120
technical strengths there's a lot of

164
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
soft skill type things that you need

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
to be aware of too

166
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,919

do you know what your clients need can

171
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
you identify those by having discussions

172
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,280
with the client

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
you know what are their goals what are

174
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
their concerns you know are they worried

175
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
about user data breaches are these uh

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
worried about pii

177
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
health information credit cards you know

178
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
all these are very specific to the

179
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
customer and you need to have an

180
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
understanding of what those are when you

181
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
approach them to get work

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
on the non-technical side are you ready

183
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,560
are you financially prepared

184
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
you know how long can you go until the

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
invoices start rolling in you know you

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
may not have work day one when you start

187
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,720
on this path

188
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
uh you have to be prepared for that

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
work isn't consistent

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
there's going to be especially in the

191
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
pen testing world

192
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
there's going to be ebbs and flows when

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,319
there's a lot of work and when there's

194
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,919
not a lot

195
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,039
how are you going to approach things

196
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,880
like benefits retirement time off you

197
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,680
know all these things that are

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,360
established and coordinated with a

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
typical job when you're freelancing it's

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,880
all kind of falling back on you

201
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
there's legal

202
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
aspects to consider too a lot of

203
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
contracts a lot of legal documentation

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
agreements things like that with the

205
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
clients you have to be ready to approach

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,360
those situations and to be able to

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
handle them

208
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
you know initially

209
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
i

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,039
didn't know what i needed to do in this

211
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
regard i went to my uh employer and i

212
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
basically said hey i have this other

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
opportunity i kind of want to pursue it

214
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
i can't do both can i be a contractor

215
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,479
and my manager at the time said oh sure

216
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,759
you know what's your rate what are your

217
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,280
terms uh

218
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,639
you know how long are we establishing

219
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,560
this relationship for what what are we

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,520
doing

221
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
and

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
uh i was completely blank no idea no

223
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,919
idea what i had to do but thankfully

224
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,520
they were able to help me

225
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,120
identify these things get everything

226
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
established i learned a lot in that

227
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,000
process

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,039
so it's one of these things that you

229
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,000
need to

230
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
to make sure that you can

231
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,280
do when you're setting up these

232
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
relationships so

233
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,599
the last thing you got to consider is

234
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,039
how are you going to find the work right

235
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
the work doesn't just come to you you

236
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
have to go after it

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
so as a pen tester there's times when

238
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,319
there's not consistent work this is kind

239
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
of a graph of my workload throughout the

240
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
year you know q1 q4 tons of work

241
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,800
available

242
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
q2 kind of gets a little bare you know i

243
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,840
gotta

244
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
make some changes in order to keep going

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,479
uh things start ramping up again

246
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,759
so you got to take that into account

247
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
with your budgeting you know

248
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,039
how are you going to get through that q2

249
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
slump

250
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,080
to make it successful

251
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,919
and the other thing to keep in mind is

252
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
that when you're a freelancer you're

253
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
taking on all these other roles and

254
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
responsibilities that are typically

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,039
handled by other people in an

256
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
organization you know you have hr you

257
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,599
have legal

258
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,919
sales marketing freelancing that all

259
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,719
becomes you so outside the technical

260
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
technical knowledge that you need to

261
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
know you need to start

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,839
getting acquainted with these other

263
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,839
concepts

264
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,958
but okay

265
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,080
you know you want to do this none of

266
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
that stuff scares you that's fine you're

267
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
ready to learn all that or you know it

268
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,160
great

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
you're ready for the change

270
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
so what do you do next

271
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
you got to get set

272
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
i'm going to go over a few things here

273
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
that are basically required but they

274
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
take time they take effort they take

275
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,519
money

276
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
but they're all required to get started

277
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
you've heard the saying there's no such

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
thing as a free lunch that's how it is

279
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,200
in business it all these things cost

280
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
money but they're really necessary and

281
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,839
you'll understand why

282
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,839
so first up uh you want to create a

283
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,839
company not a dba

284
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,720
uh

285
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
do business ads that's just basically

286
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,640
hey i can do this work you want to have

287
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
a legal entity something like an llc an

288
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
s corp

289
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,399
why uh cya you know you know what that

290
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
is you know cover your ass right

291
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
having a company protects you as an

292
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
individual

293
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,240
it gives the company the legal

294
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,839
responsibility

295
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
for the work that you're doing so if

296
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
during a penetration test you you

297
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,959
something catastrophic happens you take

298
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
down a whole data center client's pissed

299
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
they're gonna sue you if you don't have

300
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
a legal company in place

301
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
then you are personally liable for that

302
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
stuff so if you have a house if you have

303
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,000
other assets you know all those are on

304
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,120
the line you don't want to take that

305
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
risk if you want to go into the into the

306
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,800
freelance world

307
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
so creating a company kind of helps

308
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,839
protect you in that

309
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,959
regard company does some other things

310
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,120
too it it legitimizes what you're doing

311
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
right if you're just saying hey i'm a

312
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,920
pen tester

313
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
okay that's great but now you say hey

314
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
i'm a pen tester i have a company set up

315
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
all this other stuff

316
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
the companies the clients that you go

317
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,600
after they're gonna be like okay yeah i

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
get it you have you know you've gone

319
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,640
through the legwork of establishing a

320
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
company and everything so that you know

321
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
i'm more willing to to work with you on

322
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,440
that

323
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
uh doing so really kind of

324
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,600
varies by where you establish the

325
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
company right uh different states have

326
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,880
different requirements

327
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
uh there's paperwork involved there's

328
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
renewal fees you know the research that

329
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
i've said that i've done uh has

330
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
ranges between like 120 bucks and a

331
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,320
thousand dollars to establish the

332
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
company and maintain it throughout you

333
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,680
know year to year so depending on where

334
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
you're looking to establish it there's

335
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
going to be a cost associated with it

336
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
next you want to get business insurance

337
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
some companies won't even work with you

338
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,839
if you're if you're not insured right

339
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,600
they want to make sure that they're

340
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
covered too if your company you know

341
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
isn't worth anything

342
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
and you screw up and they sue you you

343
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,680
know having insurance means that they

344
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,120
they have some comfort in knowing that

345
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
you know something goes wrong they'll be

346
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
compensated in some way

347
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,920
uh so it's on you to make sure that you

348
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,279
have the insurance

349
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
established

350
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,000
the other thing that does is it um

351
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,399
it has extra protections in place

352
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
where contracts don't cover right so

353
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
you're going to have legal contracts

354
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,839
that you know absolve you of different

355
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,120
things and they dictate the terms but in

356
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,640
areas where there's where there isn't

357
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
coverage on that insurance really helps

358
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
so it's

359
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
basically layered protection right we

360
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,079
talk about defense and depth in infosec

361
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,360
this is like protection depth so you

362
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
have the company that's one you know way

363
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
of covering yourself business insurance

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
is another way

365
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
um the types of policies to look into

366
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,959
you know that's uh you're looking at

367
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
like commercial general liability it's

368
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
protecting you against you know bodily

369
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
injury property damage

370
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
uh liable advertising mistakes things

371
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
like that

372
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
policies on that you're looking into

373
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
like one to two million dollars worth of

374
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
coverage um it's relatively cheap though

375
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
it's about 350 bucks a year

376
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,519
the next one probably one of the most

377
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
important ones the arizona missions

378
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,639
again you're looking at one to two

379
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
million dollars worth of coverage maybe

380
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
more depending on the clients

381
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,399
uh about seven hundred fifty dollars a

382
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,079
year but what that one does is if a

383
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
client claims that you were negligent in

384
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
some way or your work was inadequate um

385
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
then this insurance kind of policy helps

386
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
cover that so you know in a pen testing

387
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
world

388
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,839
you missed a no day something got

389
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,839
released after you did a test client got

390
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
breached now they come after you because

391
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,519
you didn't find it right

392
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
uh the insurance policy helps cover in

393
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
those situations

394
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,519
finally you have like professional

395
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,519
liability again you know million dollars

396
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,120
two million dollars

397
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
that

398
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
covers against misrepresentations

399
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
inaccurate advice things like that

400
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
there's a lot of things that cover on

401
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
the insurance side so one way to

402
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,959
approach this is looking into insurance

403
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,440
agents right i use his cox that's a

404
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
really big player in that they know you

405
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,600
know the type of insurance that is ideal

406
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
for these types of things other agencies

407
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,079
may be beneficial to look into too

408
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,079
you need a lawyer uh specifically you

409
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,519
want a lawyer that understands business

410
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
and contract law

411
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
somebody understands penetration testing

412
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
all the legal aspects and requirements

413
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
associated with that

414
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,079
you know you want a lawyer that works

415
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
for you right they're going to

416
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,639
watch out for your best interests

417
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,600
so why you know we're cya right we're

418
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,560
there's a kind of a theme going here

419
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
they're going to be able to review all

420
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
the legal documents that you're getting

421
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
established when you're setting up a

422
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
relationship with a business you know

423
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
everything's done over these legal

424
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
contracts msas scopes of work

425
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
ndas all these things all this legal

426
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,959
verbiage in there

427
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
your lawyer will review that but make

428
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,120
sure that you're being represented

429
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
correctly and in your best interests

430
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
and it helps to make sure that both

431
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
sides are in agreement as to how to move

432
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
forward so i've had uh agreements in

433
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,839
place that were provided to me from

434
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,959
clients

435
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
and they had provisions of things like

436
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
hey any any tools any scripts anything

437
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
that you create while you're doing any

438
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
work for us belongs to us we get a

439
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,240
royalty free license forever and i was

440
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
like no that's you can have ownership

441
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,880
over the reports anything like that that

442
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,639
makes sense but anything that i create

443
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,360
is mine uh so my lawyer caught that in

444
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
the contract review they amended it the

445
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,399
company was totally fine with it too

446
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,839
they said yeah that's not really what we

447
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,000
were going for but you know their lawyer

448
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,959
put it in

449
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,880
so you know having a lawyer on your side

450
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,160
is is really beneficial

451
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,000
but the cost on the lawyer it can vary

452
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
so you know i mentioned before creating

453
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,440
the company

454
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,480
there's

455
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
lawyers that will set that up for you i

456
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
had my lawyer create my company and

457
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,480
everything for me they handled all the

458
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,399
paperwork all the

459
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,199
documentation for it um so there's a

460
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,720
fees you know fees associated with that

461
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,639
maybe a few thousand dollars

462
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,839
and then you have an ongoing retainer

463
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
with your lawyer basically you give them

464
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
a pot of money and anytime you need

465
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
their services they would draw from that

466
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,959
pool

467
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
uh to work for you and then you know

468
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,880
whatever the agreement that you have

469
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,680
with them you refresh that as needed so

470
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
a lawyer's a big help it it saves you a

471
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
lot of time a lot of money on

472
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
understanding all the legal implications

473
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
that you're agreeing to when you're

474
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,639
looking to do freelance testing

475
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,680
you also want an accountant not a tax

476
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,959
guy not somebody that'll just file your

477
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
taxes for you

478
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
somebody that really understands all the

479
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
tax laws because they're insanely

480
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
complicated right

481
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,720
so when you're working for a company and

482
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
you're a full-time employee there's

483
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,560
things like payroll taxes right you pay

484
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,399
half of them as employee the employer

485
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
pays half when you go into freelancing

486
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,079
you're responsible for that total amount

487
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
so there's extra taxes that you end up

488
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
having to account for a cpa really helps

489
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,519
you with that

490
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,480
um

491
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
you're going to have payments that you

492
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
have to make right you're getting paid

493
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
directly from the client there's no

494
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
withholdings so every quarter you're

495
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,120
going to have to make payments based on

496
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
the income

497
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,959
and your cpa will help you define what

498
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
that needs to be

499
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,839
there's benefits to take advantage of

500
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
two when you're self-employed there's a

501
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,880
lot of write-offs

502
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
things like the equipment that you use

503
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
the software you use if you have cloud

504
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,199
hosting uh mileage for

505
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,199
uh meeting with clients all those things

506
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,279
can be taken in into consideration and

507
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,120
the cpa helps you identify those things

508
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,800
and make sure they're accounted for so

509
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
that you know you know what you can

510
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,040
uh you can claim what you can't claim

511
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
making sure you're playing by the rules

512
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,759
because you know at the end of the day

513
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,880
the government wants their cut they

514
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
don't care uh having somebody that

515
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
actually understands it

516
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
is the best way to go and they're

517
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
relatively cheap you know mine

518
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
is about 500 a year for all the services

519
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,680
they provide for my personal my business

520
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,839
taxes my wife's taxes

521
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
it's it's really not a huge expense and

522
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
it's a huge

523
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,800
like burden

524
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,959
to be absolved of so

525
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
um you know summarizing that there's a

526
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
couple things here we have the business

527
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,199
creation you know

528
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,120
hundred to a thousand bucks

529
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
legal side

530
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
one to five thousand dollars counting

531
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
insurance you know it's all your startup

532
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
fees essentially for the for the

533
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
freelancing could be in the area of five

534
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
to ten thousand depending on your unique

535
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
situation

536
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,919
okay so we talked about why you want to

537
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,720
do a got some things established on

538
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
you know how to get ready for it uh the

539
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,240
last thing before you take the leap is

540
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
work right how do you get the work where

541
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,880
do you get the customers

542
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,880
as a pen tester one of the best ways to

543
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
go about it is subcontracting right a

544
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
lot of consultancies they have

545
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,520
ebbs and flows in the work that they

546
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
have available or that they need to get

547
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,080
done

548
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
similarly

549
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
according to the chart like i showed

550
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
before

551
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
that you know q4

552
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
uh craziness and work

553
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
a lot of companies face that so

554
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
they typically don't always have enough

555
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,720
work to hire a full-time person so

556
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
they'll so they'll subcontract it out

557
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
uh basically

558
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,000
the nice part about this is you don't

559
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
have to go find clients to do the work

560
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,440
the companies already have it ready they

561
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
just need somebody to do it so that's

562
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,039
where you can come in

563
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
you still basically have to interview

564
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,919
with these companies they want to make

565
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
sure that you're good fit that you're

566
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,360
technically capable that you're able to

567
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,799
do the job

568
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,640
you can follow their guidelines their

569
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
procedures as they relate to things like

570
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
reporting client communications

571
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
things like that

572
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
but there's also some additional things

573
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
to take into consideration when you're

574
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,400
looking into subcontracting

575
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,679
you want to talk about rates you want to

576
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,200
talk about terms

577
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,679
uh scope statement of work reporting and

578
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
communication your availability right

579
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
because it's on your terms now as far as

580
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,880
when you're going to be available but

581
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
you need to communicate these

582
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
with anybody that you're looking to

583
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
subcontract with because they want to

584
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,000
know

585
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,039
are you able to are you going to be

586
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,160
there when i actually need you for the

587
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
work so you need to discuss all those

588
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,360
things

589
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
um it's definitely a great way to get

590
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
started it relieves some of the pressure

591
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
of finding the work

592
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
um

593
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
it's not quite as profitable as some of

594
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
the other methods of getting work

595
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
but if you're looking to get into it

596
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
this is this is definitely a great

597
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,559
approach

598
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
but i mentioned rates here so that's one

599
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,240
thing i really wanted to take a moment

600
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
here to kind of discuss

601
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
you know when you're freelancing you

602
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
have to

603
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
understand that you're not working 100

604
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
of the time all year

605
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
so you need to figure out what your

606
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
rate's going to be according to you know

607
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
all those uh specific factors

608
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
so calculating your rate you know one

609
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
way to approach it is take like a target

610
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
salary for like a position like a pen

611
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,880
tester

612
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,360
um you divide it you know by 48 and

613
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
divide it again by 40 to get kind of

614
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,960
like an hourly rate and that hourly rate

615
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
you want to double that so you know

616
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
let's say for example target is 150 000

617
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,240
a year

618
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,600
uh weekly it's uh what 3 100

619
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
gets you an hourly rate of 75 dollars so

620
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
a good rate to go about you know as a

621
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,280
pen testers starting at 150 an hour

622
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
that helps you cover

623
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,400
the times

624
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
when you're not working

625
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,200
and to take into account all the

626
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
administrative work that is part of

627
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
getting the work

628
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
established so you know things like

629
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,880
having the discussions with clients

630
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
setting up work discussing everything

631
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
and all those things you want to

632
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,919
calculate in so having you know a rate

633
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,520
that makes sense

634
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
is going to help you be successful

635
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,919
um but you know not all

636
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,919
all companies that are willing to

637
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,600
subcontract

638
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
are going to meet your rate they're not

639
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
going to be agreed agreeable to it just

640
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,320
because they don't have the budget for

641
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
that so

642
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
you have to make a decision there like

643
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
do you accept a lower rate if they're

644
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,799
giving you more consistent work does

645
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,640
that make sense or is it just not going

646
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
to be a good relationship so things to

647
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,159
take into consideration if you're going

648
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,120
the subcontract route

649
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
direct work is the other

650
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
method to pursue it's harder to get

651
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,559
because you're essentially reaching out

652
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,400
to those end clients that need to have

653
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,360
the work done um there's a lot of

654
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,080
overhead a lot of administrative work

655
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
because you know this is where you

656
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,799
become the sales person right you're

657
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,320
trying to sell your services what you're

658
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
able to do and how it's going to help

659
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
them

660
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,640
uh you need to understand and discuss

661
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,000
their needs uh where you can help and

662
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
then you have to also handle all that

663
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,760
documentation that i mentioned before

664
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
you know they they may want like a

665
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
proposal they may want a scope of work

666
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
uh they want pricing you know you want

667
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,360
to take all that stuff

668
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,120
and uh you're going to know how to do

669
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,960
that for the direct work but

670
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,320
on the plus side it's more profitable

671
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,520
you're going to make more money on that

672
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
just because there's no middleman in

673
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
between you and the end client right

674
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,559
there's no

675
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,640
company taking a cut

676
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,799
for themselves

677
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
so the other way to go about it is

678
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
networking this has been one of the best

679
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,240
ways that i've found work uh twitter

680
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
linkedin

681
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
uh the the netsec reddit subreddit um

682
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
you know when you when you see a lot of

683
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,640
job postings and there's companies that

684
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
are looking to hire pen testers that

685
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
means typically that they have a lot

686
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
more work to do than they can handle so

687
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
you know one tip there is to reach out

688
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
to some of those companies ask them if

689
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,280
they're open to subcontracting for them

690
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,360
it's kind of a win-win they can execute

691
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,200
on the work you get some money and they

692
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,720
don't have like you know an employee on

693
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
their payroll

694
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,320
but this is where a lot of marketing

695
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
comes into play you know how do you

696
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
approach some of this stuff

697
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,799
you know some of the important things to

698
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
consider is when you have your company

699
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
having a website having business cards

700
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
having a tire you know take into

701
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
consideration how you're presenting

702
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
yourself in person online because

703
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,240
clients that you're looking to work with

704
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
are going to use all that to make a

705
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,360
decision on whether they want to work

706
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,039
with you um so these are important

707
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,320
things to to uh to to think about uh

708
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
here even you know besides las vegas

709
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
yesterday just sitting around talking

710
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559

help me so you know conference

715
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,039
networking is a huge huge way to get

716
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,960
some work

717
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,919
but

718
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
main thing here is just your reflection

719
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,840
on the company that you create who you

720
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
are what you're doing

721
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
and all that stuff is

722
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
you know much more magnified when you're

723
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
a freelancer right you're not you don't

724

know the reputation of a company

726
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,000
other things that you want to do is

727
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
you know when you do work with any

728
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,120
clients try and get some testimonials

729
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,720
get some feedback so that you can use

730
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,880
that you know to sell yourself to other

731
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,159
companies that are looking for work be

732

[Applause]

760
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,520
we've got time for like a question or

761
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,559
two if anybody has one

762
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,159
first of all thank you very much for the

763
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
presentation um

764
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
can everyone hear me

765
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
so the question i had for you is in your

766
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
opinion or in your experience how much

767
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
of the workload is subcontracting and

768
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,039
how much of it are companies now

769
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,720
starting to bring this discipline

770
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
in-house

771
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,640
so from a company perspective uh that's

772
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,240
going to vary depending on the company i

773
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,520
know some that are very heavy on the

774
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
subcontract side right they they prefer

775
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,039
to subcontract out a majority of their

776
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,559
work others are very much just as needed

777
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,279
me personally i would say about 75 of my

778
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,919
work is subcontract and 25 of my work is

779
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,240
more direct i'm hoping to like invert

780
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,159
that a little bit but i went with the

781
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,240
approach of the subcontract work to get

782
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,159
more business going and to make sure

783
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,240
that i could you know uh

784
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,320
be successful and you know kind of make

785
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,158
sure that i have a gave it a good shot

786
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
any other questions yeah just feel free

787
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,039
to reach me in the hall or whatever um

788
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
i'll try and if there's online questions

789
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,720
there's probably a way for me to check

790
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,919
those out too

791
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,279
i don't know i don't know about online

792
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,120
questions but yeah um he'll be out in

793
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
the hall uh

794
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
that's it we ran out of time for

795
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,000
questions so another big round of

796
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,480
applause for mike
