1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,480
so on the same day October 1st

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,060
um of

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,280
2021 we uh the Wall Street Journal

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,980
published uh the the loss of that baby

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,240
in Alabama

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,280
um but we knew that we dismissed as

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,940
anecdotes or random or just one uh we

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,859
also on that same day published um the

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,359
first statistical proof of loss of life

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,060
that um cyber attacks can degrade a

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,519
hospital and a region sufficient to

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,080
drive access deaths both for time

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,580
sensitive conditions like heart brain

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,840
and stroke

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,600
uh and Pulmonary but also through some

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
excess death analysis our data science

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,980
team did and then number uh three on the

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,620
panel is uh Lisa young systemic and risk

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,820
management and cyber physical citizens

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,260
person from the team

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,700
so that's going to be session two is

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,620
some of the things we saw where bits and

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
bytes were meeting like uh you know

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,820
flesh and blood on a daily basis

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,680
um I think several of us have PTSD from

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,420
that but um these are some of the

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,460
superheroes from different backgrounds

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,399
than hacking that brought their skills

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,739
to Bear along with Beau and others

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,799
um and Spanky and many others that had a

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,000
very different pandemic experience than

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,680
many of you

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,400
uh next up will be um rivers on fire and

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,020
David Batts is going to walk through

35
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,340
since many of you didn't even see all

36
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,960
these but we had existence proofs of the

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
attacks on water on food supply on oil

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,060
and gas pipelines on municipalities and

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,040
we have a a tour de force through some

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,020
of those existence proofs and possibly

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,720
how parts of government are are and are

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,759
not reacting appropriately so that'll

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,220
simmer you in maybe things you knew half

44
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,200
of but you'll know more of

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
uh followed by um one common thread

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,180
through most of these victims is they

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,220
are Target Rich cyber poor we just took

48
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,799
a riff on winning ether's poverty line

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,240
but in a much more applied and

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,880
operational way and one of the

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,380
uncomfortable truths here is even though

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,200
the government sponsors ice ax and uh or

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
information sharing analysis centers for

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,860
all 16 critical infrastructure sectors

55
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
and even though they sponsor sector

56
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,100
coordinating councils of leadership from

57
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,079
the public private partnership and even

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,040
though there's lots of free information

59
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,020
sharing and free indicators of

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,180
compromise and free resources from sisa

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,740
and the different agencies responsible

62
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,979
for those 16 like Health Care is HHS or

63
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,480
the healthcare industry

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,220
most of the participants in there are

65
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,860
the Cyber rich they're the haves not the

66
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,599
have-nots most of the attacks and the

67
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,040
victims or the have-nots they're below

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,200
that poverty line so if the private

69
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,879
sector sees no money in helping the

70
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,800
Cyber poorer and the public sector says

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,239
let's partner with the private sector we

72
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,000
have a very circular problem so I have a

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,519
deep passion and burden on my heart

74
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,160
for fit for purpose

75
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
help to the Target Rich cyberport owners

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,540
and operators of critical infrastructure

77
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,220
we cannot say just do best practices

78
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,440
just do zero trust just do this just do

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
that they don't have a single cyber

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
security person on staff we have to meet

81
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,660
them where they are identify and buy

82
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,160
down risk and we do that every single

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,920
day uh and this is Task Force with what

84
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,900
we had available I'm hoping maybe part

85
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,540
of our next phase of our mission is

86
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,800
crowdsourcing and creating tools that

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,540
actually help people because the private

88
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,159
sector won't

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,260
my framing for that is if you think of a

90
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,599
pyramid with a Fortune 100 and 500 up

91
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,159
top and then there's everybody else down

92
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,200
below

93
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
ransomware gave the adversaries the

94
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,120
attacker as a way to monetize the

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,500
cyberpore

96
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
Defenders have not figured out how to

97
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,560
monetize the cyberpore

98
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,140
so it's a Feeding Frenzy

99
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,819
attackers can monetize the poor

100
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,040
Defenders have not figured it out so

101
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,180
they are

102
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,879
prone they were always prey they were

103
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,440
always prone and now Predators have

104
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,540
taken notice so we have a Feeding Frenzy

105
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,700
for the foreseeable future and when you

106
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,920
press my former agency and their

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,480
teammates in government they say well we

108
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,940
partner with the private sector

109
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,620
um and that's a sincere answer but it's

110
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,780
not a helpful one so there are some

111
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,519
existence proofs that some of my

112
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,599
assistant teammates are going to talk

113
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,680
about where we did things for the

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
cyberpore like get your stuff off search

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
or was I like to call it get your

116
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
off showdan

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,260
um free skinning Services uh we coined

118
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,640
this thing system.gov bad practices

119
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,140
you're going to hear about so not just

120
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,400
best practices or what are the most

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,680
dangerous things that we encounter and

122
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,080
how can those become the negligent

123
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,620
standard or eradicated strategically and

124
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,060
while they are common practices that are

125
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,319
also dangerous

126
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,420
so that's going to be maybe a nudge and

127
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,880
inspiration for tomorrow uh Jen Ellis

128
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,399
has assembled uh some Guppies as well a

129
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,139
lot of progress has been made over the

130
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,639
last two years so we're gonna have a

131
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,860
policy update with our friend Leonard

132
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,100
Bailey from doj on strides to further

133
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,780
decriminalize good faith security

134
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,400
research which is one of our day one

135
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
goals so that's amazing

136
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
and uh we have a hacker as a senate

137
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,479
staffer uh and a pretty important Senate

138
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,520
uh position who's going to talk about

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,840
some of the other things that have

140
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,040
happened and things that are coming

141
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,720
because a huge chunk of what we do is

142
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
not fixing a single flaw on a single

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,020
device from a single manufacturer but

144
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,479
maybe changing the rules to make more

145
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,460
defensible maintainable reliable digital

146
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,900
infrastructure

147
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,160
and then we'll have the feedback loop

148
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,419
from you so that was a lot of stuff for

149
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,699
day one uh you're gonna hear much more

150
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,220
detail from our assembled team

151
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,320
um but this is to simmer you in the

152
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,539
discomfort that shits on fire

153
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,520
most of them are the target rich in

154
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,580
cyberpore they're not ample Solutions or

155
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,139
engagement models and in some of those

156
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,000
sectors like food there's not even a

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,259
nice Act

158
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,960
so uh just like I said the Cavalry isn't

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,520
coming nine years ago I meant it for

160
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,440
different certain specific details but

161
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,180
for now there's a lot to do and there's

162
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,699
no one stepping up to do it so we can

163
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,979
either get them to the starting line

164
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,080
with us or we can fill a void

165
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,020
temporarily but um there is much that

166
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,400
has been accomplished that we should be

167
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
very very proud of

168
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
and there is much much more to do

169
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,460
which will pivot us into tomorrow and in

170
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,539
case I don't have an opening session

171
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,940
I'll do a much faster version tomorrow

172
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,580
uh press coverage has been one form for

173
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,960
cyber security for a very long time so

174
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,699
we've asked Lily hey Newman from wired

175
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,220
to help us assemble some press to say

176
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,800
how should press change if shit's on

177
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
fire now we always say well until bad

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,220
things happen you know this is

179
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,979
theoretical well they're happening and I

180
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,240
want to ensure that we don't always have

181
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,940
a private or commercial voice giving you

182
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,199
know corporate talking points when

183
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,419
there's people dying or that whenever I

184
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,860
say hey there were losses of life in

185
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,240
this particular ransomware in a hospital

186
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,620
we don't have someone say yeah but what

187
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,360
about the patient record count and the

188
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
fines like we want to make sure that

189
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,660
we're focused on the right things and

190
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,100
this will be a conversation tomorrow

191
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,380
about how can we best make ourselves

192
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,940
available to the press and how do we

193
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
ensure that coverage

194
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,800
of consequence

195
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,759
um

196
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,500
makes deliberate conscious Choice

197
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,940
changes and there are some obstacles

198
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,800
that are unobvious that Lily and I were

199
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
discussing a couple days ago it's going

200
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,520
to be tough right press works a certain

201
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,800
way we work a certain way we're gonna

202
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,180
have to work a different way if we want

203
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,860
to make differentiate corporate security

204
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,500
from cyber physical safety uh and Public

205
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,759
Safety

206
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
uh followed by s-bomb s bomb is a double

207
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
talk uh spam software bill of materials

208
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,919
um this is one of those uh

209
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,139
day one Cavalry ideas it's across the

210
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,539
chasm and is in an executive order it's

211
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,819
happening uh it's inevitable uh it is

212
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,580
not easy there's some opposition but

213
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,680
s-bomb is a dual dual talk tomorrow it's

214
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,319
really both showing how things like

215
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,639
software build materials software

216
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,259
transparency software trustworthiness

217
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,660
could be part of the answer for starter

218
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,460
it's cyberpor maybe they can't invest in

219
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,620
security but they can get more

220
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,680
of a head start and a leg up on some of

221
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,780
these things but also um one of the

222
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,220
coolest things in the espa movement was

223
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,240
an open source project called

224
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,699
daggerboard that was a hospital said hey

225
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,900
no one's building anything for us we're

226
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,099
going to build it ourselves and they

227
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,960
open sourced it so it's not a solution

228
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,520
for all things s-bomb but how do people

229
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,740
consume and operate and Avail themselves

230
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,660
of things like s-bombs from plural

231
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,060
places and plural levels quality next

232
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,440
time there's a log for Jay and there are

233
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,360
still hospitals calling me even last

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
week saying it's been eight months Josh

235
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
I still don't have an impact analysis

236
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
from my vendors eight months later we

237
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,900
still don't know where log4j is for some

238
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,180
of the medical devices no no promise of

239
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,160
patching so that's part of why we want

240
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
to talk about s-bomb and I think it's in

241
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
decent

242
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,900
universe and a grain of sand that may

243
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,479
Inspire why we need more developers in

244
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,979
the Cavalry ranks why we need to build

245
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,259
more tools that can meet a wastewater

246
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,479
treatment facility where they are solve

247
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,039
their problems for their most egregious

248
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,599
exposures

249
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,639
while we're waiting for the Cavalry to

250
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,160
come from either coin operated private

251
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,379
sector and or

252
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,460
um

253
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,139
the government figuring out who swim

254
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,879
Lanes or which swim lanes and how to

255
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,120
help so that's going to be um both

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
informational for s-bomb but also

257
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,319
hopefully inspirational for the kind of

258
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,339
things we might want to do in the next

259
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,799
phase of the cavalry

260
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,320
um trying to do this for memory uh we

261
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,479
have an ICS talk

262
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,059
um on how to talk to uh

263
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,519
stakeholders about ICS and OT security

264
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,140
issues and I might have this in the

265
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,760
slightly wrong order and then we also

266
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,260
have a basically what I've been calling

267
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,600
acting black act Global act local act

268
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,060
Global uh talk which is there's been

269
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,120
some state level experiments and Ray

270
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,920
from Michigan is going to talk about one

271
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,839
of the state level experiments in the

272
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,519
state of Michigan for hackers working at

273
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,680
the local state level there's been a lot

274
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,420
of efforts from Beau from others the

275
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,800
national government Association in the

276
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
past but this is more tailored fit for

277
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,720
purpose at each state or municipality

278
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
level and then we have some people from

279
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,200
the Cyber peace Institute that are

280
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,720
talking about how that is a part of an

281
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,700
overall Patchwork of parallel

282
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,860
experimentation internationally and

283
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,720
there have been some national and Global

284
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
movements like the Cyber threat

285
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,160
intelligence leagues CTI League that

286
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,019
helped operationally with these Hospital

287
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,519
attacks early in the pandemic and

288
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,980
continues to so there are new parallel

289
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,540
efforts Cavalry in shape uh or in spirit

290
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,220
and this is potentially one of the areas

291
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,360
where we're going to have to go hire

292
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,700
internationally bowled a really

293
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,220
incredible uh initiative with the world

294
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,680
economic forum

295
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
that is one of those global examples of

296
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,680
maybe minimum pledges for how iot should

297
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
not have hard-coded passwords for

298
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,700
example uh or be patchable

299
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,899
things that you might have heard from

300
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,339
this group for a while

301
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,980
so um this could be part of our future

302
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,380
is scaling up and down and laterally and

303
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,519
seeing what you can do to help your

304
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,260
local municipalities for your food your

305
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,579
hospitals your state governments

306
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,980
and then uh I think I'm doing I didn't

307
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,260
miss any but we're also going to do a

308
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
very large chunk of workshopping to hear

309
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,279
from you as to what you think we can and

310
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
should do and commit to do and how we

311
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,839
can get some scale and uh Jen and others

312
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,420
reminded me that um while Beau and I and

313
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,899
some of the other long-standing

314
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,160
Advocates and public speakers and

315
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,980
ambassadors do the best we can we really

316
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,959
need logistical and organizational back

317
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,279
office support we need project

318
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,500
management we need to get better at

319
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,660
being historians capturing the truth

320
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,360
maybe having records of what happened

321
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,579
when in what order by whom

322
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,980
um so there's a lot more roles to be

323
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,540
filled that would give us more scale

324
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,640
more staying power and more parallel

325
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,800
action and clouds I don't see clouds in

326
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,019
the room it closes been the volunteer

327
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,880
coordinator in Wrangler for much longer

328
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,620
than any single person should have to so

329
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
we're really looking for more uh Welcome

330
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,980
Wagon and onboarding that can whenever

331
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,060
someone says hey I would like to help

332
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,579
how do I get started so there's a lot of

333
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,500
volunteer roles to be filled and maybe

334
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,940
we can identify some of those in our

335
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,459
two-day two-hour session tomorrow

336
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,260
I just gave you an avalanche of

337
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,300
logistics as opposed to inspiration how

338
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,019
much time do I have left

339
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,200
where's my Proctor huh

340
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,579
how many

341
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,440
okay

342
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,779
all right any questions on that

343
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,380
Avalanche

344
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,079
the overall theme and feeling we want

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
you to have is nine years ago we said

346
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,100
stuff was flammable and we wanted to be

347
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,959
left a boom to prevent harm and maintain

348
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,300
trust we've done some incredible things

349
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,339
and I hope for a few minutes now to

350
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,660
share some of the highlights in the last

351
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,040
nine years

352
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,260
um while I pull up some slides

353
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,180
but uh

354
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,740
now that things are on fire I do think

355
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,959
the mission needs to change

356
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,639
um I just don't know how you know we

357
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,320
could say mission accomplished I don't

358
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,200
really think that's apt uh we could

359
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
definitely get some new leadership and

360
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,320
new blood into the mix but I think it's

361
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,700
going to have to be

362
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,779
um

363
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,240
a reorganization of the focal points and

364
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,880
how we measure success all right

365
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,480
um

366
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,060
would you like to share a couple of your

367
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,800
favorite accomplishments over the last

368
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,860
nine years or compare and contrast

369
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,980
yeah sure so as as I was thinking about

370
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,800
um what we could talk about today

371
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,959
uh it occurred to me that like nine

372
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,399
years ago

373
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,680
uh as Josh said there was a lot of

374
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
kindling there's a lot of things that

375
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,519
could catch fire some of them we saw

376
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,260
catch fire and we paid the most

377
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,360
attention to those tended to to look at

378
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,260
those the most because they're in the

379
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,720
press or the hype cycle uh but that's

380
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
not all that's happened in these so for

381
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
every highly visible failure there is at

382
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,060
least one measurable uh piece of

383
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,459
progress in that area so if you think

384
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,540
back

385
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,000
um you know nine years ago I think that

386
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,820
was a year or two after uh we saw people

387
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,579
drive cars off the road uh through

388
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,380
hacking them

389
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
um the Auto industry said oh well that

390
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,680
only happened because you were sitting

391
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,240
in the seat next to the driver

392
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,160
uh that can't happen remotely and then

393
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,540
the next year they made it happen

394
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,760
remotely they said well yeah but that's

395
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,160
theoretical and it can't happen

396
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,760
um

397
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
this is where

398
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,720
uh when we came in we started talking to

399
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,279
some of those car makers started talking

400
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,139
to Nitsa the national highway traffic

401
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,480
safety administration

402
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,920
um some of those different organizations

403
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
pulling people together we published

404
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,920
something we called the the five-star

405
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
Automotive cyber safety framework

406
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,120
playing off the five-star crash rating

407
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
system uh and started talking about that

408
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,380
trying to get some adoption and

409
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,839
awareness and managed to actually I

410
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,779
think incept quite a few car makers

411
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,880
um who you know some of them hired

412
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,100
sizzos because they saw an increase in

413
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
talks at black hat but uh when they got

414
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,360
there what they got there they didn't

415
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,639
have a tool kit right you tend to apply

416
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,500
what you have and most of the toolkits

417
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,839
we have are for how do you operate an

418
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,399
environment you know how do you build

419
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,260
your corporate network not how do you

420
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,420
build a product and so what we put out

421
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,459
was actually really helpful for those

422
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,860
individuals to think through as well as

423
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,680
contribute to it and then go apply it in

424
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
their own organizations and so we've

425
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,720
actually seen within the car domain a

426
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,040
couple of things come out

427
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,000
for automotive cyber safety Nitsa

428
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
published one the automotive ISAC

429
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
published one and we've got a couple of

430
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
friends in the automotive ISAC the

431
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,459
person who ran the aviation ISAC for a

432
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,079
while went over to the auto ISAC and

433
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,480
she's very very friendly to hackers

434
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
um so we had some successes there and

435
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,220
the industry had some successes there uh

436
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,560
also if you go back and you look uh you

437
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,860
had people at black hat Defcon b-sides

438
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,720
talking about medical device security

439
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
issues and there was a lot of uh kind of

440
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,760
fear around medical device security

441
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,800
because there are people walking around

442
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,500
probably some even in the room today

443
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,019
um who have a higher quality of life or

444
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,880
who wouldn't be alive without a medical

445
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,360
device connected to them at all times

446
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,940
and at the time you know the industry

447
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,620
and the hackers were at odds with each

448
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,519
other

449
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,399
fortunately the FDA stepped in and said

450
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,959
look we don't know what's going on we're

451
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,459
not cyber security experts but there's

452
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,320
something here we need to figure it out

453
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,240
and we need to figure it out together

454
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,040
and help bring together the hackers the

455
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,839
manufacturers the doctors the patients

456
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,300
everybody else that we published

457
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,920
something else called Hippocratic Oath

458
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,500
for connected medical devices again

459
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
playing off of something that that most

460
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,040
people already associate with that

461
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,079
domain

462
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,880
um and I it's on the screen here I won't

463
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,639
read through it but the idea was that uh

464
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,740
just as doctors take a symbolic oath to

465
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,000
act in the best interest of their

466
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,980
patients when they're delivering care

467
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,380
the same should be true with devices

468
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,019
that deliver care now that they are the

469
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,880
primary way that doctors interact with

470
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,160
patients either directly or through

471
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,540
proxy

472
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,360
um and this had a lot of success uh the

473
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,639
FDA you know I won't go through all of

474
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,019
the successes in this because as Josh

475
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,060
said we've had a ton of success in

476
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,820
healthcare and medical but the FDA put

477
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,040
out something that they call pre-market

478
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,779
and post-market I won't get into all the

479
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,060
the wonky policy details of that of

480
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,519
those two docs but essentially if

481
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,079
something is going to go on to the

482
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,420
market and be sold in the U.S it has to

483
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,220
follow certain guidelines the FDA

484
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,860
reviews that once it's on the market if

485
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,420
there are issues that come up that could

486
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,459
impact Effectiveness or patient safety

487
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,579
the FDA wants some ability to have the

488
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,339
manufacturer address those and if you

489
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,740
put those two documents side by side and

490
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,240
align them with this Hippocratic Oath

491
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,040
for connected medical devices it's like

492
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
one for one almost everything that we

493
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,899
wrote about is now the law of the land

494
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,139
it's it's instantiated in this guidance

495
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,740
um

496
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,259
for medical device makers that this is

497
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,540
how the FDA is going to evaluate you so

498
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,079
it's not suggested it is effective if

499
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,160
you want to get on the market and stay

500
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,380
on the market you have to follow these

501
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,299
rules of the road

502
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,119
um tons of thank you

503
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,178
um

504
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,220
tons of medical device makers are out

505
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,660
there we have the biohacking village

506
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,079
device lab which uh if you haven't been

507
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,900
I highly recommend it a bunch of medical

508
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,819
device makers come in and bring devices

509
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,740
put it in front of hackers and say we

510
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,059
know you can hack this we just want to

511
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,760
know how so we can fix it that is 180

512
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,500
degrees from where we were nine years

513
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,539
ago there's been an amazing amount of

514
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,660
progress there if you look at the

515
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,640
household iot

516
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,820
so uh you know household iot is a bit of

517
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,039
an outlier there's not as much human

518
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
life Public Safety attached to that but

519
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,539
it is a huge issue and I remember

520
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,320
um

521
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
flying to Austin Texas uh one October

522
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,980
for an ntia event where Allen had

523
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,980
gathered a bunch of people to talk about

524
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,559
software updateability upgradeability in

525
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,640
iot

526
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,500
and there were a lot of people from

527
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,020
industry there some of whom were all

528
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,240
about it and others said ah it doesn't

529
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,179
matter it's not a big deal like if uh if

530
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,039
something doesn't work you know we'll

531
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,120
just disconnect it from the network

532
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,539
that'll be a fine that's a fine solution

533
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,020
um and I think I said something like uh

534
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,799
you know it's not the individual attacks

535
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,600
um against a single device that matter

536
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,780
it's leveraging all of those exposed

537
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,360
prone devices on the internet to cause

538
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,400
harm and what was it Alan like a week

539
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
later that the Mirai botnet hit

540
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,380
and you know people in the room are like

541
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,880
oh you're wrong it's not going to happen

542
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,919
no one would ever do that literally a

543
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,580
week later this happened and that caused

544
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,080
a whole lot of things to happen in

545
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
government I I sometimes say that

546
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,340
government lost its Collective

547
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,100
um because this was such a pronounced

548
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,299
impact

549
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,580
uh that they thought only a nation state

550
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,679
could have this kind of impact cause

551
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,179
this kind of harm on the internet well

552
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,160
it turns out it was some uh College

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,380
dropouts who were trying to knock a

554
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,179
competitor's Minecraft server off the

555
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,000
internet so this is like hobbyists

556
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,220
extremely low level of capability folks

557
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,080
who were able to have a huge outsize

558
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,480
impact and so there were many many

559
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,860
initiatives that started in the US

560
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,140
government as well as others

561
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,600
um that led to I think a lot of progress

562
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,500
uh in that area up to and including you

563
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,720
know some of it uh kind of snowballed

564
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,140
and people were saying well if this is

565
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,360
the impact that could happen to home iot

566
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,000
devices what about bigger systems

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
pipelines industrial control systems and

568
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,340
so you've seen in the past couple of

569
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,679
years a series of executive orders

570
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,419
Congressional actions and other things

571
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,640
looking at what we can do and it turns

572
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,900
out

573
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,000
um most of the government's action in

574
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,860
this area has been how do you operate

575
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,960
the equipment more safely

576
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
well I think a lot of us were saying and

577
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
have been saying the the hackers in the

578
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,980
in the world hear the Defcon black hat

579
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,840
and all the other b-sides around the

580
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
world is once you get a vulnerable

581
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,440
exposed uh thing on your network it's

582
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,240
already too late to do a lot of the

583
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,080
critical safety critical steps that can

584
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,580
only be done when you're designing

585
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,220
building it and implementing it so let's

586
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,799
move way left not just left of Boom but

587
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,059
left of by

588
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,039
and get to a place where we can

589
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,539
influence those standards so you've seen

590
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:36,059
a lot of things in executive orders uh

591
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,039
and in some other government requests

592
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,360
and right now they're trying to figure

593
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,700
out how they can get left to buy because

594
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,080
in some cases their authorities don't

595
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,039
let them

596
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,980
um so they're working on uh you know new

597
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,740
types of ways that they can actually

598
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,320
equip organizations rather than

599
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,820
hamstring them or allow them to be

600
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,220
hamstring hamstrung so that when they

601
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,799
buy something they can know what the

602
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
security posture of that thing is they

603
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,260
can put measures in place and they can

604
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,120
choose alternates

605
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,700
um if what they see in the market uh in

606
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,679
some segments of the market doesn't have

607
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,200
the security capabilities they need so

608
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
for all of the the Badness we still are

609
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,539
in there's been a lot of progress in our

610
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,760
day one thesis was can't be just us

611
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,520
doing it and it can't be any part of any

612
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
sector any industry any government doing

613
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,659
this it's got to be all of us working

614
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:29,820
together and so where we see some of

615
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,200
those successes I think it's our

616
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,539
responsibility to highlight them to

617
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,120
promote them to Dogpile on them to jump

618
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,539
in and and help lift those up to make

619
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,460
those road maps for success for other

620
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,520
Industries to build on them to extend

621
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,679
them and just to make sure that they

622
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,659
they get the effect that they need to

623
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,840
have

624
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,640
yeah there's so much to be proud of and

625
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,900
so many of the people in this room and

626
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
not in the room people streaming online

627
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,840
people at home that have done some

628
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,020
things so maybe to punctuate that

629
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,820
um a couple of the things as I reflected

630
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,320
on the flight here

631
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,580
um

632
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,080
there wasn't a lot of ice act when we

633
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,640
started you know we helped get that off

634
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,260
the ground the five star has become a

635
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,700
blueprint for how do you avoid failure

636
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,440
take help avoiding failure without suing

637
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,000
the help or capture study and learn from

638
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,340
failure respond to failure contain and

639
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,659
isolate failure

640
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,780
uh we affected the shape of the FDA

641
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,299
policy for the US and the planet we

642
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,740
caused the first safety communication

643
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,320
and recall with zero dead people first

644
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,900
and that was like the moment when we

645
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,240
really knew that we were on to something

646
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,860
we uh

647
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,840
extended our reach into other areas when

648
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,640
that Mirai botnet happened we wrote a

649
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,880
 law hackers wrote a law

650
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,039
now obviously there were Partners in the

651
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,360
senate in the house and it took two

652
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,179
entire Congressional sessions but in

653
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,140
late 2020 that thing passed into law

654
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,480
it's a minimum hygiene standards for iot

655
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,240
purchasing uh he mentioned the executive

656
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,679
orders we knew that this isn't just

657
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,299
about responding to failure but this is

658
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,400
making more rugged defensible survivable

659
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,039
uh anti-fragile things and then we've

660
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,080
really tried to ensure that the Next

661
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,640
Generation regulatory is focused on

662
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,760
threat modeling and Patch ability and

663
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,400
maintainability and embrace of hackers

664
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,440
acting in good faith with coordinating

665
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,700
vulnerability disclosure programs which

666
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,620
is now required for all federal agencies

667
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,659
all federal agencies have to have a

668
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,100
coordinated vulnerable disclosure you're

669
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,240
gonna hear from Leonard they'd be

670
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,679
actually giving guidance to not

671
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,020
prosecute hackers acting in good faith

672
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,539
so we are increasingly making it easier

673
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,179
for us to keep people safe and then when

674
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,980
the planet was going through a once in a

675
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,120
hundred years

676
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,140
um

677
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,659
very dangerous very lethal event they

678
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,640
turn to several calorie people to both

679
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,140
design and Implement what the federal

680
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,799
and Global Response should look like

681
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,900
um so we got to put on

682
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,480
get conscripted to a certain extent and

683
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,460
put on go time

684
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,620
um and we could only do this because of

685
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,000
the collaboration and creativity of

686
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,640
every single one of you and we hacked

687
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,980
the government in in lawful ways and

688
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,380
hacked the planet I mean I don't think

689
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,940
they fully realize the impact the

690
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,380
long-term impact is some of the things

691
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,000
that we published like bad practices

692
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,380
this is going to this is already

693
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,480
changing insurance

694
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,820
we have just declared what bad looks

695
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,380
like what negligent looks like what

696
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,900
dangerous looks like and the student you

697
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,640
walk past as a sinner you endorse and

698
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,100
just in case uh you don't come for Don's

699
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,020
part the at least the two we got through

700
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,360
initially was the use of unsupported end

701
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
of life software in service of critical

702
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,260
infrastructure and National critical

703
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,600
functions is dangerous

704
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,580
and material elevates risks to Public

705
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,080
Safety economic and National Security

706
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,779
this dangerous practice is especially

707
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,640
egregious in Internet reachable

708
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,380
Technologies

709
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,659
we've now put a stake in the ground

710
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,760
could enable

711
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,000
Insurance exceptions wrongful death

712
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,740
lawsuits

713
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,580
FTC consent decrees

714
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,500
you name it regulatory action and then

715
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,059
number two is the use of hard-coded

716
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,860
default and guessable maintenance

717
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,200
password is is also dangerous so this is

718
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,179
a growing list of things and some of

719
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,039
those hacks will have long-standing

720
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,440
future implications but these were

721
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
powerless hackers at b-sides

722
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,299
being bold and trying to make sure that

723
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,700
we hold ourselves a better standard so

724
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,039
before I shift to the last 10 minutes of

725
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,720
Ramon's concert

726
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,700
um I'm going to say one of the lines we

727
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,440
got into the executive order

728
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
um

729
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
because I think this is me trying to

730
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,659
channel my inner Dan gear uh but now

731
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,279
that things are on fire

732
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,080
it's just a riff on what our day one

733
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,940
problem statement was I said that in the

734
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,220
end the trust we place in our digital

735
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,860
infrastructure should be proportional to

736
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,779
how trustworthy and transparent that

737
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,159
infrastructure is

738
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,919
into the consequences we will incur if

739
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,960
that trust is misplaced and I've always

740
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,240
looked at this group as we trust things

741
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,220
without them deserving the trust and we

742
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,520
want to you know narrow the gap between

743
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,600
overdependence on undependable things

744
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,539
and ensuring that our neighbors and our

745
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,980
loved ones can

746
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,600
enjoy the benefits of those connected

747
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
Technologies the promise without the

748
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,380
Peril and I've always said the failure

749
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,059
mode wasn't the specific losses of life

750
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,580
it's any crisis of confidence in the

751
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,020
public to trust these Superior

752
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,600
Technologies so we are in my opinion the

753
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,820
lighthouse Keepers to be that heat be

754
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,440
light be heat be good

755
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
to try to ensure that we're warning both

756
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,640
the promise and the Peril of these

757
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,500
choices in that order dependence and

758
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
we're in a very dangerous moment in

759
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,080
history

760
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,600
where we're

761
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,539
out of balance there and your actions to

762
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,460
date have put us on a better footing but

763
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,620
there's so much more to do for the next

764
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,720
couple years and I hope to answer the

765
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,039
question what should the Cavalry look

766
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,140
like with you today and tomorrow and

767
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,820
throughout the rest of the week and

768
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,340
through Defcon but Bose really taken

769
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,600
some of this Spirit into the Defcon

770
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
policy track Village whatever we want to

771
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,100
call it and just walk around the

772
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,140
Villages Maritime Village Aerospace

773
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,600
Village ICS Village a biohacking village

774
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,179
we have a large Auto hacking Village we

775
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,039
have a large and growing tribe of tribes

776
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,080
that are all learning from each other

777
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,279
and making each other better through

778
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,779
parallel experimentation so I can't wait

779
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,700
to see what you bring to this

780
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,760
all right harsh uh transition to the

781
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,080
last maybe 10 minutes I'm not going to

782
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,580
show you everything but I was spitting

783
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,760
fire in uh New York City two weeks

784
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,799
through two three weeks ago

785
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm just going to show a few things

786
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,020
there from there

787
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,059
all right so Andrew matuition

788
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:27,779
um

789
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,279
had said

790
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,960
No One's Gonna listen to you it's not

791
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,460
gonna be like a cyber 911 or cyberpole

792
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,299
Harbor it's going to be like the

793
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,580
Cuyahoga River in Ohio right it caught

794
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,899
on fire and stayed on fire how do you

795
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,220
put out a river on fire you all heard

796
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,179
this from me if you've been in these

797
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,740
rooms before

798
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,779
um we have had fires folks we had

799
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,640
Oldsmar water facility the water we

800
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,620
drank has been on fire

801
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,320
fire the food we put on our table with

802
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,200
JBS and other meat and food supply chain

803
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,539
attacks fire

804
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,700
the oil and gas that fuels our cars and

805
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,860
our homes fire

806
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,260
the municipalities the schools the

807
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,460
people who function our local

808
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,960
governments and our federal governments

809
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,240
at the National Security level have seen

810
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
compromises and even

811
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,200
fire

812
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,399
timely access to Patient Care which

813
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,020
Kendra's session is going to go through

814
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,600
in extreme detail but we have had losses

815
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,440
of life

816
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,360
so with the precursors were when I

817
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,919
started that we served on a

818
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,059
congressional task force for healthcare

819
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,559
industry cyber security as part of this

820
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,860
is a 2015 law and in Spring of 2016 a

821
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,260
single Java flaw in a single uh it was a

822
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,120
deserialization plot a single JBoss

823
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,500
library in a single Medical Technology

824
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,179
took out Hollywood Presbyterian hospital

825
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,039
for a week

826
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
uh you had to divert ambulances in LA

827
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,940
traffic even a block in La is maybe not

828
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,980
a survivable reroute they actually

829
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,960
cancel surgeries move patients

830
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,340
throughout the week it was harrowing

831
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,440
later on when we were about to publish

832
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,600
or just had published the Mirai botnet

833
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,460
that we referred to we published our

834
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,919
Healthcare task force report saying uh

835
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,919
overtly Health Care cyber security is in

836
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,299
critical condition I'm reminding you of

837
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,740
this slide because Kendra may have a

838
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,740
slide that says provide medical care is

839
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,539
in critical condition the national level

840
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,700
but the idea here was these were the

841
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,080
Cyber poor they didn't have security

842
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,520
people on staff they were defending

843
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,380
Windows XP or older they were over

844
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,240
connected to each other flat unsegmented

845
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
networks and reachable by the outside

846
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,240
world this wasn't about privacy I love

847
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,860
my privacy I want to be alive to enjoy

848
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,840
it

849
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,940
and uh and yet everything was about

850
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,520
HIPAA uh and then lastly Billy Rios

851
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,779
pointed out a typical medical device

852
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,580
could have a thousand or more cves in it

853
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,840
and while most of those are not

854
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,760
exploitable it just takes one

855
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,220
and we said this is not good and we

856
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,600
talked about well there's no money and

857
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,740
we said we can't afford to protect it

858
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,179
you can't afford to connect it or my

859
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,039
Stan Lee friendlier version of great

860
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,419
connectivity comes great responsibility

861
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:45,120
and then our UK Partners had 40 of their

862
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,860
UK of their National Health Service

863
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,600
disrupted for Mother's Day weekend

864
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,360
within days of us trying to publish this

865
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,940
so the U.S got quite lucky but not

866
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,100
patchy actually did more damage to U.S

867
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,600
infrastructure including nuanced

868
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,980
software and a bunch of medical devices

869
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,659
and some hospitals shut down for time

870
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:03,000
and some kids in this book couldn't get

871
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,100
they were cleared for surgery so kids

872
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,500
had potentially delayed surgery because

873
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,539
of the entanglement and brittleness of

874
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,419
I.T systems little kids couldn't you

875
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,100
know get surgery without some heroism

876
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,679
from maybe somebody in this room

877
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,020
um and what we know is that delays cause

878
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,600
uh patient outcome harm so you've seen

879
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,220
this from me before but I'm reminding us

880
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,039
as a primer for Kendra's session here we

881
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,480
know from a seminal piece of New England

882
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,679
Journal medicine a study that has

883
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,940
nothing to do with cyber security that

884
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,440
if you have a heart attack during a U.S

885
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
marathon in a U.S Marathon City during a

886
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,820
marathon you're more likely to die

887
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,860
uh and the reason is the 4.4 minute

888
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,539
longer ambulance ride to get around the

889
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:40,440
runners

890
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,179
had a statistically significant

891
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:44,220
mortality rate after 30 days

892
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,399
so we know time equals mortality

893
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:48,600
for some of these immeasurable

894
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,059
quantifiable ways and I said okay so

895
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,860
this is from Christian demaff one of our

896
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,659
fantastic teammates and Jeff Tully board

897
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,159
certified Physicians that grew up going

898
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,179
to

899
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,539
uh Defcon quality and replicant and they

900
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,860
helped us understand that certain time

901
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
sensitive conditions um any delay

902
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,640
irrespective of cause can affect

903
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,200
mortality so if we know delay affects

904
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,179
mortality for brain for heart for

905
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,159
pulmonary on a certain graduated

906
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,779
timelines

907
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,399
if cyber security can introduce

908
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,380
significant delay cyber security can

909
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,419
introduce loss of life

910
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,279
so we started killing people at the

911
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,659
cybermed summit which is now its own

912
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:24,360
non-profit cybermed is doing a lot more

913
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,640
and formalized including the first DC

914
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
event recently uh where I think Senator

915
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,019
Warner gave our opening remarks

916
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,820
and we showed that you could introduce

917
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,760
real hacking in contrast with real

918
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,679
um physiology to see if doctors can

919
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,539
notice what happened save the lives and

920
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,940
through demonstrable real world hacks

921
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,960
like

922
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,000
insulin pumps like Jerry Radcliffe like

923
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,559
the bedside infusion pump from Billy

924
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,200
Rios like the hacking of pacemaker

925
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,120
defibrillators maybe with a three-digit

926
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,860
universal access code that maybe caused

927
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,360
a recall

928
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,880
um that these Physicians is well trained

929
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,320
as they are implicitly trusted this

930
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,659
technology and were gobsmacked we then

931
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,220
started doing more tabletop crisis

932
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,279
simulations to test their assumptions

933
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,440
um and saw different failures we hacked

934
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,299
the Integrity of blood banks in the or

935
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,580
so that you put the wrong blood type in

936
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,320
the surgical field and it coagulates and

937
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,480
bad things happen and we found you could

938
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,919
even hack people without touching them

939
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,919
uh if you can't tell if a stroke is a

940
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,679
rupture versus a clot the clot Buster is

941
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,240
a miracle drug that will save your brain

942
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,220
and save life time is brain but if you

943
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,140
can't diagnose it quick enough if you

944
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,240
give that to a rupture you'll kill the

945
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
person they'll bleed out so it's merely

946
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,980
disrupting Imaging and not having next

947
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,899
proximal Alternative Care in driving

948
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,940
distance or helicopter distance meant

949
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,559
people died that didn't need to

950
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,419
and then you don't even have to hack the

951
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,360
device at all there was an incredibly

952
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,760
expensive radiation delivery precision

953
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,620
machine that heavily relies on cloud

954
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,720
computing the cloud was down for a very

955
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,039
long period of time during the pandemic

956
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,899
and so those incredibly expensive

957
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,240
otherwise functioning uh radiation

958
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,940
delivery devices couldn't do their job

959
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,279
they were bricks big heavy paperweights

960
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,440
because we always assume the cloud will

961
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,080
always be there except for when it isn't

962
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,380
so during the breaking points here

963
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,940
um when the con this is where I get

964
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,200
heavy okay

965
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,059
um and I may say more during the week

966
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,399
but this has really messed me up from my

967
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,659
public service and I'm getting over it

968
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,419
I'm trying but when the country hit 500

969
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,760
000 dead Americans from covid we also

970
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,640
hit 150 000 additional Americans who

971
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,220
lost their lives from uh non-coveted

972
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,100
excess deaths the CDC tracks checks xss

973
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,260
all the time it's a rolling average of

974
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,000
who died in which state in which month

975
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,799
from which condition so if you normally

976
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,360
see a hundred from this place in this

977
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,220
state and you see 110 you have 10 excess

978
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,159
deaths I asked my team hey I bet you

979
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,480
these are time sensitive conditions

980
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,100
what's killing these people let's study

981
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,580
it and remembering the four 4.4 minutes

982
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,340
can lead to loss of life for a heart and

983
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,260
four hours one to three to four hours is

984
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,299
loss of life for strokes

985
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,320
what could four weeks do four weeks

986
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,940
a regional outage to the state of

987
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,019
Vermont

988
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,299
so I said we need to study this we need

989
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:08,820
to understand what happened and my team

990
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,619
is going to take us through that in the

991
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,060
next session but

992
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,918
um while we were racing the publish and

993
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,960
it took much longer to publish than I'm

994
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,579
comfortable with and a lot of extra

995
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,219
people died in the meantime The Wall

996
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,418
Street Journal put on the front page is

997
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,980
that that baby

998
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,320
um is possibly the first victim of cyber

999
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,300
disruption uh degrading and delaying

1000
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,040
care enough we are surrounded by

1001
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,480
technology this is the bonding moment

1002
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,099
Beau and I had nine years ago in the

1003
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,480
speaker Lounge about

1004
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,480
was it confer on the the NICU infant

1005
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,699
fetal heart monitors if you degrade

1006
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,560
these technology assists you degrade the

1007
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,839
care we have more patients admitted

1008
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,280
because we have been able to scale with

1009
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,839
technology take that technology away and

1010
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,760
you're more much more dangerous moments

1011
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,800
so the patient has to be at the center

1012
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,940
of this

1013
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,500
and lives have to be at the center of

1014
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,579
this we should care less about record

1015
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,980
count and more about human life timely

1016
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,480
access to care

1017
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,160
so we published some stuff it took a

1018
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,420
long time a lot of people in government

1019
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,400
did not want us to publish this but we

1020
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,040
are tenacious and stubborn and creative

1021
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,020
and we did a turducken within a

1022
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,440
turducken but we got uh we got it

1023
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,940
published and essentially what we found

1024
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:17,119
was uh back in February uh March of 2020

1025
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,579
2021 at the one year mark

1026
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,079
um we said are there any leading

1027
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,300
indicators any leading indicators that

1028
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,820
correlate to this um excess death

1029
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,280
surging we had and what we found was

1030
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
another public data source called ICU

1031
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,720
bed count or intensive care unit

1032
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,160
um bed count 75 is usually optimal

1033
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,440
during the pandemic it was fatal and we

1034
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,140
measurably so and for example what we

1035
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,380
saw is if you hit 75 percent

1036
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,780
ICU strain Nationwide you'd see 18 000

1037
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,000
dead Americans two weeks later an

1038
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
additional months four and six weeks

1039
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,300
later if you got to one hundred percent

1040
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,579
you'd see eighty thousand dead Americans

1041
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,720
and unlike

1042
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,000
covered deaths these were primarily 25

1043
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,619
to 44 year olds these are younger people

1044
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,240
that needed timely access to care I

1045
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,800
myself almost didn't get timely enough

1046
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,300
care for surgery

1047
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,619
because of the strains on these

1048
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,480
hospitals so we wanted to warn people

1049
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,280
that if you could manage your ICU strain

1050
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,320
you could avoid elective loss of life we

1051
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,060
published this um something that Kendra

1052
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,980
is going to walk through

1053
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,420
called provide medical care is in

1054
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,240
critical condition and uh and through

1055
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,520
this analysis we could see that systems

1056
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,440
hit by ransomware for protracted amounts

1057
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,180
of time could be strained sufficient to

1058
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,619
lead to loss of life

1059
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,420
and I recently testified to the Senate

1060
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,520
on the record that these attacks have

1061
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,940
led to measurable loss of life so it's

1062
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
in the ecosystem now and when I'm asking

1063
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,540
each of you for the next couple days is

1064
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,640
not just to up and renew your

1065
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,859
participation but how do we change the

1066
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,119
conversation so that whenever someone

1067
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,680
says there's an attack we don't just go

1068
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,480
back to well how many records were there

1069
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
or what was the cost of the ransom or is

1070
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,680
there a HIPAA fine none of those things

1071
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,200
matter what matters is timely access to

1072
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,660
patient care for you for your loved ones

1073
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,140
because the a growing toll

1074
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,940
from these attacks is that we have seen

1075
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,220
10 20 and 30 losses of critical

1076
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,200
infrastructure Workforce the people who

1077
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,420
make sure we have drinkable water who

1078
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,160
make sure we have food supplies and

1079
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,140
groceries stocked we make sure we have

1080
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,240
timely access to Patient Care we make

1081
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,740
sure the oil and gas and electricity

1082
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,859
works and we are with Maslow and

1083
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,599
we can't

1084
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,099
so as the world is increasingly

1085
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,599
depending on digital infrastructure they

1086
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,599
are increasingly depending on us so what

1087
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,000
role will you play and how should we

1088
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,800
change over the next two days because

1089
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,540
we've done some incredible things over

1090
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,160
the last nine years we've been left of

1091
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,180
Boom

1092
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,700
more times than I ever expected

1093
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,040
but there's a lot of booms right now

1094
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,140
shit's on fire what are we gonna do

1095
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,880
about it thank you for being here and

1096
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,599
I'm out of time
