just getting started uh hacking remote

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,560
interviews and we're not talking about

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,720
load renaming your profile

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,439
to zoom.exe to see if you can connect to

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,040
the interviewer's machine

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
funny but probably not going to get you

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
the job

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,680
i was working

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
longest time in the federal government

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,520

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
stuff lots of travel is a great job opm

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
data breach happened i had to go to the

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
civilian sector and realize i hadn't

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,439
can't hear me

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
how about now

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
right

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,439
logistics this is good this will go to

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,000
the point later so

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
i've been in the government for a long

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,159
time

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,040
and

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,880
opm data breach happened i had to go

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
look from the outside for work in the

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
civilian sector one of my friends told

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,280
me back in 2017 you haven't interviewed

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
for a job since bill clinton was in

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
office things have changed covet hit

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
things changed even further right

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
so i was up in canada working with

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
nato

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
doing training with canadian special

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,840
forces cyber stuff for them

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
and started looking on the outside for

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
work it was a good job but it could be

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,319
better right that's why y'all are here

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
looking for better work

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
and some of the lessons that came up i

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,519
came and went had interviews had jobs

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,680
with um paraphrasing

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,959
uh

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
got acquired by a big fortune 4 company

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
but you know the axiom

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
last hired first fired during covet i

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,720
got laid off right before the colonial

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
pipeline breach

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,959
so

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,120
it's coveted everything's shut down and

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
i've got to look for work

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
being now a former intelligence officer

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
i started discerning

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
what's working what's not working why

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,319
are these interviews going well what's

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
not and looking and distilling what's

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
really happening

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
so i'm will baggett former cia officer

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
nato special forces trainer

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
schuman collection a lot of cyber

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
collection director of digital fringes

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
for operation safe escape

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
fantastic group chris is in the audience

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,879
we do fantastic work changing lives i

92
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
don't want to sound

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
presidential it's a great group it's

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
fantastic but it is

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
amazing what we accomplish to help

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
people's lives

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
i'm a cyber threat intelligence manager

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,680
at a place if i mention the name it has

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
to go through legal so we won't name

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,879
them

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
hardest thing to remember

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,360
someone told me this once i hated it

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
and he was right

104
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
every job is temporary

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
you're going to exit the airplane on

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
your own time frame

107
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
or when someone else wants you off the

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,560
plane and that's a hard thing to

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
acknowledge either you want a better job

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
the situation's gone south it's toxic

111
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
there's a merger acquisition

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
management changes from a leadership to

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,319
a management role things happen

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
but the time to prepare to get off the

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
plane isn't in the air

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
it's well no

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
it's not when it crashes never mind

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
sorry too much red bull that'll go to

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
another point

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
you need to prepare yourself now

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
the example of you know i hate remote

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
interviews i detest them but they're

123
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
better than going in person

124
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
a brief example from the book of zen and

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
the martial arts

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,960
someone said you know this tennis player

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
is so much better than me what can i do

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
to get better can i try this tactic or

129
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,639
that tactic

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
and i realize that is a wall of text

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
but the best way to

132
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
defeat

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
someone or improve the process is to

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
make yourself better make your line

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
longer what can i do to make the

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
interview process better for me so i

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
stand out from the crowd

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
you know always going back to the three

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
infosec principles

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
of data confidentiality data security

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,320
data availability integrity sorry

142
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,560
and paraphrasing that to the remote

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
interview principles

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
you have to control your environment

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,479
you have to minimize your interruptions

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
and maximize your advantages there are a

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
lot of things you have control of that

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
you can do that you can change

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
first big step is to control your

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
environment

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
when we talk about helping digital or

152
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
domestic abuse victims that's also the

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
first thing is what can i immediately

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,919
control

155
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
in my area

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
for the remote interviews

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,199
i realize there's a lot of different

158
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,039
situations a lot of living situations

159
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
this is a generic overview it's not a

160
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
one size fits all i thoroughly

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
acknowledge that

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
if you can at all look at your router

163
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,440
your other devices connected and pt puff

164
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
anybody know what pt puff is before we

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
even go down the road no

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
okay

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
you want to maximize your bandwidth this

168
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
is right up front

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
bluff bottom line up front

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,039
you want to disconnect every single

171
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
device in your house except for your

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
router your smartphone and your laptop

173
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
that comes from hard experience

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
and even on those you want to disable

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
all but the necessary apps on your phone

176
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
wicker is a fantastic secure chat

177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,479
application

178
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,919
it's a battery hog anyone out there

179
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,360
using wicker

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
no signal i know some people are on

181
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,560
signal

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
it's pretty rough whatsapp is not so

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
good either

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,199
but when you have that phone interview

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,720
do you really need to have these other

186
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,160
apps on the phone that are going to

187
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
drain your battery yes we're getting

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
very basic stuff because when the

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
plane's crashing you've received notice

190
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
you've been laid off

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,800
there's going to be a laid off you've

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
been put on a pit whatever things life

193
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,000
happens

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599
you're not thinking about these by new

195
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
details that's why it's on a checklist

196
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
if that phone dies in the middle of the

197
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
interview

198
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,039
is that going to build rapport with the

199
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,479
interviewer or is it going to kill

200
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
rapport you want to do everything to

201
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
keep it positive

202
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
case in point i was interviewing for a

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
director at a

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,639
remote security company

205
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
things were going good

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,759
we have

207
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
playstation 4 in the house my son loves

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
call of duty's black ops he loves a

209
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
zombie thing whatever

210
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,520
right during the interview when they're

211
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
getting into hiring roles whatever

212
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
it pulls one of the massive playstation

213
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,960
4 downloads kills my bandwidth and i go

214
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
from clear and smooth to looking like

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
max edward

216
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,759
they ghosted me that's okay salary's low

217
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,319
but i needed a job

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
so yes these are all hard-fought lessons

219
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,039
learned the hard way you want to test

220
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
your bandwidth speed or is the router

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,479
performing as advertised you may need to

222
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,000
call your i your internet service

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,960
company

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,879
you might be getting at paying for a gig

225
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,120
and you might be getting 100 meg

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
check that first before you start the

227
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
interview process again going back to

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,440
osc we've had a lot of

229
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,319
we had a lot of victims clients at osc

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
say i think my ex is keeping my signal

231
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
and my voip app from working because

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
when i leave where he lived the app

233
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
works again and over time we discerned

234
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
that it's not

235
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,720
they've not been hacked it's the default

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
security setting on the xfinity router

237
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,080
that's blocking these packets and once

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
we learned that the client learns that

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
they lower their security

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,759
they can make the call they're good to

241
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,120
go

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,719
but you want to test that before the

243
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,080
interview

244
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,599
we'll go to your router we'll check your

245
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,958
bandwidth we'll see what's truly

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,599
connected here it's an android phone

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
it's a laptop and an iphone that's good

248
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
what other edge devices are you if you

249
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
have kids you know the plethora of

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
devices they're going to have connected

251
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
you want to have those off again the

252
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
standard disclaimer we can't talk about

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
every router every configuration but

254
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
this is the core we start from ground

255
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,080
zero to make sure you have a good

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,839
connection it doesn't matter how

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,279
polished you are how presented you are

258
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,760
how many sans search you have

259
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
if you don't have a good connection to

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
make a good impression

261
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,160
the rest of it's lost

262
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
again this is granular but these are

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,720
again hard-fought lessons

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
charge your phone before the interview

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
connect your laptop to ac power even

266
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
here practicing what i preach i have my

267
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
laptop connected for the presentation

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
or being streamed

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
wouldn't look very good to talk about

270
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,760
how well to do a remote interview in my

271
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
laptop dies

272
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
you never want to assume it should be

273
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
fine no

274
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,160
should be and will be fine are two

275
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
different things again this is in the

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
weeds for

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
before you even the little light comes

278
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,120
on you want to have these things done

279
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
here's a

280
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
tech interviewer who

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
recruiter who placed me at my current

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
company

283
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
we're talking after the placement and he

284
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
said

285
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
when you interview for a remote job you

286
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
are demonstrating your ability to remote

287
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,320
to work remotely

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,560
if you show up late if you're distracted

289
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
if you're playing with your phone these

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
are the negative things like granular

291
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
things it doesn't matter how great the

292
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
new c2 tool cover to excel data is

293
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,800
if you're sitting there playing angry

294
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
birds or plants versus zombies during

295
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,800
your interview basic stuff

296
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
but i've seen it as i'm interviewing

297
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
people for roles in my company

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
pt puff put the props up front

299
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
this is where a little bit of the subtle

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
manipulation comes in

301
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
if the corporation uses

302
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,000
whatever software platform for the

303
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
slides it's generic but for the

304
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
presentation

305
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
prior to the acquisition by celebrite i

306
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
have quite a bit of blacklight digital

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
forensic company merchandise that the

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
mugs from training coffee cups the

309
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
shirts so when i'm interviewing for a

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
forensic roll i have that on

311
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,360
it's starting to date me a little bit

312
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,519
after the acquisition but

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
oh yeah i got this shirt when i visited

314
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
apple in cupertino if they ask about it

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,640
you don't mention it let them mention it

316
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
but yes i've got my waffle house mug

317
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,640
full of water

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
but why not have a

319
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
sand smug why not have your defcon mug

320
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,160
oh yeah i was on a panel at defcon and

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,399
they gave me this as a speaker let them

322
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,920
ask about it and you get to advertise

323
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
yourself just a little bit more it is

324
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
subtle manipulation

325
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
and they did kind of train this and edit

326
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
cia manipulation so you want to

327
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,360
manipulate as best as you can

328
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
anything in your background anything

329
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,199
around you to help you not to hurt you

330
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
another key point the only acceptable

331
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
use of your phone during the video

332
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,519
interview is as a clock

333
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,200
mine's in my laptop put up in a way

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,079
trying to be a good role model

335
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
so if it's over here is a clock so you

336
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
can see a timer

337
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
great

338
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,000
out of reach

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,240
phone is off it's on silent you don't

340
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
want to have any notifications

341
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
if they think you're distracted and

342
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
looking at something else perception is

343
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
reality

344
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,519
you may think

345
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
i'm just checking this they say you're

346
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,680
not paying attention the first time i

347
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,720
spoke

348
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
training over at nato over in belgium i

349
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
had all my notes on my phone

350
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
i pull it out the instructor mentor he

351
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,480
was a 20-year trainer from the army

352
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,639
military police school he flipped out in

353
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,399
the back used some choice words about my

354
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
phone away

355
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,560
i saw it as i'm reading my notes he saw

356
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,839
it as you're screwing around on your

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,600
phone the troops saw it screwing around

358
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,320
on your phone again i made a mistake

359
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,760
lesson learned passing that on the

360
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
community you don't want to do that

361
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,240
same thing works for your corporate

362
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
presentations internal meetings you want

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,519
to have those other notifications off

364
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,720
just because you've got your job

365
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
congratulations but if whatever unique

366
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
dating app has that unique dating sound

367
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,399
and you hear that going on during a

368
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,160
meeting

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
that's not cool

370
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
another one

371
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,800
patching your device

372
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
of course you know working in i've done

373
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
nerf sip audits

374
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,440
we manage vulnerability patching

375
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
the i'm expecting to get pushback here

376
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
yes pegasus ngo zero click malware is a

377
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
threat

378
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
the probability of someone attacking me

379
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
in the hour during that interview in the

380
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
hour before that interview

381
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,440
that probability versus having my phone

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,399
brick

383
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,079
and die before this major key hiring

384
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,680
role

385
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
i'm willing to take the risk of i can

386
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,440
wait an hour to patch my phone to make

387
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
this interview rather than oh crap my

388
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,000
phone's dead i can't contact the

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,399
interviewer everything's on my phone

390
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,920
they think i've ghosted them when you've

391
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
had tech issues you don't want to have

392
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
automatic updates

393
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
i hate windows

394
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,120
took mcsc off my resume on purpose if

395
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,199
you have that automatic windows update

396
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,199
and your laptop switches over to update

397
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
mode during the interview

398
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
guess who's not getting hired that's you

399
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,639
you don't want to do that you don't want

400
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
to risk no good functionality for an

401
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,120
upgrade we had us

402
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
we had a instructor flying to belgium

403
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,639
from australia

404
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,160
he had an automatic update on his

405
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
machine after he landed it's a long

406
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
flight he was tired automatic update

407
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
machine was bricked my twitter handles

408
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
ios forensic i've done mac forensics for

409
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,320
years

410
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
so now i've gone from instructor mode to

411
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,959
digital data recovery

412
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,760
because he accepted the update he was

413
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
offline for the rest of the week

414
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
if he had waited

415
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
he would have been back in rotation he

416
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
could have taught the troops

417
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,440
your background i've had

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
interviews where i'm in suit and tie

419
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
early on would never do that again if i

420
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
don't have to

421
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
the interviewer is in his bed

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,519
has his cat on his chest wearing his

423
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,920
v-neck t-shirt with a concert and you

424
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,519
know mr bigelsworth is having a good

425
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,399
time but it's 100 not professional you

426
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,399
don't want to be that you either want to

427
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,760
have something professional in your

428
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,079
background

429
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,199
unless you're interviewing with

430
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,720
universal you probably don't want the

431
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,399
spongebob template you want to present

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
what is this saying about me

433
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,560
because one if you have just your

434
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,959
bookshelf they're not looking at you

435
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,839
they're

436
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
show a hands who's actually

437
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,040
when you see someone's background are

438
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
you looking at their books what's on the

439
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,000
shelves are you you're looking at the

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,399
house aren't you yeah

441
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,920
they're doing that to you as well we had

442
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
one person at former company he had a

443
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
1990 georgia tech national title bottle

444
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,880
that's great

445
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,920
he had baby grogu on his desktop that

446
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,760
was cool and all sorts of books what'd

447
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
he talk about

448
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,199
but i remember the props he had behind

449
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,120
him so maybe he should have gone with

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
this with his nice big fat executive

451
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,480
salary but it was still something i

452
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,079
remember three years later this didn't

453
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,040
fit this wasn't right you want to choose

454
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
wisely

455
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
because if you're the selection hiring

456
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
manager just something simple is that if

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,920
you have two equal qualities you

458
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,320
two equal candidates you want the

459
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
professional

460
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,480
for the salaries we get paid in cyber

461
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,160
you need to present yourself the best

462
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
possible picture at every given

463
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
opportunity

464
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
preparing your laptop

465
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,440

467

all the debris that's on your desktop

471
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040

but we use it

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,199
because that's what it takes

487
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480

quality devices the marketing people

could tolerate the consumer focus group

506
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
said this is good enough

507
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
they would go lower quality if they

508
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,360
could

509
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
but their customers wouldn't let them

510
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,679
with your years of experience

511
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
do you want to rely on that 15 cent

512
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,039
microphone or do you want to get

513
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,480
something just a little bit better if

514
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,799
your budget permits because even though

515
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,480
yes my friend who's a hiring amazon

516
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,280
manager said but will it doesn't matter

517
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,919
what they have if the hiring manager has

518
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
a crappy microphone well yeah that's

519
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,160
true

520
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,440
but they just showed thor ragnarok for

521
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
number four in charlotte the imax dome

522
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,679
they recorded that

523
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,120
even though it might be shown on your

524
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
iphone or the little bitty screen on the

525
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,720
tv they recorded they gave it the best

526
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
possible presentation think of yourself

527
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
the same way this is a studio production

528
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
you want the best possible

529
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
outcome so if you go through something

530
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,039
like

531
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
that remember

532
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,120
or you have a good microphone which

533
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
one's going to get hired right

534
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,880
again this is all about perception and

535
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
presentation if they have trouble

536
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,559
understanding you now when you're

537
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,400
talking to the internal stakeholders

538
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,679
they'll have trouble

539
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,280
you may not get the job you want to

540
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
again all the little things matter

541
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
your lighting quality what time of day

542
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
is your interview if it's early in the

543
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
morning and the sun's coming in and

544
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
you're squinting to look at the screen

545
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
because you didn't think about

546
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
the curtains in front of you

547
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
all these little things do matter to

548
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,200
help you get that job

549
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
this is one of the better cheats

550
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
a little awkward here

551
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,480
so

552
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,919
this is your house this is your

553
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,559
residence you control the environment if

554
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,160
you have your sticky notes with your

555
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
examples back here along this area on

556
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
the other side of the wall from your

557
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,600
camera they're not going to see that you

558
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,080
have cue cards why not cheat why not

559
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,039
hack it

560
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
hack the planet hack the interview

561
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
have your common interview questions

562
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
there if they ask registry questions

563
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
well maybe we should all go to hacker

564
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
trivia later on tonight practice that

565
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
instead of tech skills

566
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,799
and you again we want to emphasize this

567
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,240
a couple of times we've seen the meme on

568
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
9gag probably the guy in the tux in the

569
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
front and he's got lingerie in the back

570
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
you want to consider if your

571
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,160
mirror behind you shows your notes

572
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,600
behind you they're going to see that

573
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
they can see your screen or you make

574
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,120
sure i've got the video presentation

575
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
behind me but just what can they see

576
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
from my environment that's going to

577
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,679
distract them

578
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,520
the red slides are you know the military

579
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
you would kick the podium for the main

580
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
point

581
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,679
i'm not really going to do that here

582
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,320
nervous people speak at a fast pace

583
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
that loses translation you want to speak

584
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,640
slowly you don't want to do like mark

585
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
levin where it's repeat the last

586
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
sentence said repeat the last and said

587
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,000
because that's a verbal thing once

588
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
people realize that they don't notice

589
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,960
what you're saying they notice you're

590
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,559
repeating that so

591
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,280
slow and deliberate not

592
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
incredibly southern slow that drives

593
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
everyone nuts but a slower

594
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
where if english is second or third

595
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
language they will understand you

596
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,559
the toddler model

597
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
again telling you how to suck eggs brush

598
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,559
and flush before your interview

599
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
the time to need to go isn't when you're

600
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,840
sitting there trying to make a good

601
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,760
interview we have people laughing you're

602
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,720
like yeah i've been there

603
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
thank you

604
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,039
turkish coffee can wait you don't want

605
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
to be overly caffeinated and excitable

606
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
during the interview you want to have

607
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
some coffee but you don't want to be met

608
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,919
foley i've been downstairs in the

609
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
basement drinking coffee for three hours

610
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,240
before you go live with a hiring manager

611
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
this as a

612
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
we have done this

613
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,480
you want an account just for interviews

614
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
email account phone number line two is

615
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,440
fantastic google voice works

616
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
having your phone number

617
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
your true phone number your cell phone

618
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
is your dna you can go on different

619
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,159
sites and see where that cell phone

620
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,240
number's associated

621
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,960
mail.com has i feel like a salesman here

622
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
i'm not they have around 200 different

623
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
domains that's why i have an

624
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
engineer.com account instead of at gmail

625
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
just a little bit more professional

626
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
there's at consultant there's architect

627
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
different ones but that'll help you

628
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
stand out just a little bit more

629
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
than the next candidate you're competing

630
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
against

631
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
next one is a kind of mistake

632
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,679
you don't want to use your sock account

633
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
for your google chat

634
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
we'll just leave it at that but uh the

635
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
hiring panel laughed they all went on

636
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
mute they were laughing i got almost

637
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,840
immediate rejection because

638
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,159
turns out becky with her picture that i

639
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,720
use for my ocean research wasn't exactly

640
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
me and yeah so

641
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,918
we don't want to do that

642
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,039
another thing from one of our friends

643
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,600
said look at the corporation's standard

644
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
interview questions at georgia tech we

645
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,000
call that word if you if this professor

646
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
teaches the same class quarter after

647
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,600
quarter and they use the same test you

648
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,360
get a copy of the test yeah they didn't

649
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
change it no harm no foul c for complete

650
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
d for done

651
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,200
if large corporation keeps using the

652
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
same hiring questions why don't we go

653
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
see what they are get this review know

654
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,400
what these are have your answers

655
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,799
beforehand post it around your screen so

656
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,760
you know how to answer this best

657
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,960
one of our people she's found around 50

658
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
for one job she's now a

659
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
senior associate senior

660
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,679
consultant for the company relocation

661
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280
package paying for all sorts of training

662
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
she's done very well because

663
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,960
she went to glassdoor and got the

664
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
interview question there's no heart oh

665
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,000
yeah there's a camera

666
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,840
yeah when in doubt look about it's

667
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
better to cheat than to repeat that's

668
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
what a college football coach said so

669
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
no harm looking at these questions

670
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,799
now ocent is your friend of me it's

671
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,799
fantastic for these but you can expect

672
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,159
the interviewer to turn around and do

673
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
the same for you if they see that your

674

677
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
versus

678
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
someone who's got a little bit more of a

679
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
stable lifestyle which one are they

680
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
going to go for

681
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
so a little bit of osimp of course

682
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,000
they're going to look at your linkedin

683
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
profile you want to have that complete

684
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,799
one tool x1 discovery you wanna heard of

685
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
this no

686
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,960
it you put in the target

687
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
subject whatever you don't call it you

688
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
put in their name and it harvests their

689
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
whole social media profile so you can do

690
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,039
deep dive analysis of their lifestyle

691
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
so be cognizant of what you're

692
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
presenting in all fronts

693
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,880
the one that i like because it's free

694
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
uh ocean framework i know chris knows

695
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,679
this anyone else

696
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,559
very simply go to osyntframework.com

697
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
take their short name from their

698
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
twitter drop it in here get a full

699
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,279
pattern of life all the other accounts

700
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,120
where they're going so if you're on was

701
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
it cash app or venmo and it's

702
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,279
paid for weed paid for weed paid for

703
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,640
weed paid for bail versus nothing

704
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
because you lock down your profile guess

705
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
who's getting hired for the privacy role

706
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
at big corporation

707
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
again it's all sorts of little things

708
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,360
that will disqualify you they're looking

709
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,039
for a reason to say no and coming from

710
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,799
government it's hard to find someone

711
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
that can say yes but you find a mermaid

712
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,120
i find an army of people that are happy

713
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
to say no

714
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,679
from that i pivot over to uh have i been

715
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,159
phoned drop in the email account to see

716
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,080
what groups is this person in are they

717
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
using the same email account and they

718
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
show up at ashleymadison.com they may

719
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,039
have been added there by mistake there's

720
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,919
a barack.obam at whitehouse.gov in the

721
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,440
have i been phone list for ashley

722
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,600
madison obviously maybe not real i don't

723
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,080
know if his bill clinton whitehouse.gov

724
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
definitely would be real but you want to

725
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,559
make sure everything you present this is

726
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
my email it hasn't been leaked because

727
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
it's not used anywhere but for the

728
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,240
hiring process all these little things

729
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,760
do matter before you even get that

730
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
interview

731
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
don't laugh water one everyone's sitting

732
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,960
high-rated here drinking enough

733
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,239
putting on dad mode but

734
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
think of royal think of you know the

735
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
british queen

736
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
presidents generally

737
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
uh most leadership they have glasses of

738
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
water they don't have the walmart bottle

739
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,279
of water that's

740
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,799
which one's going to give the better

741
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,039
impression again pt prep had the problem

742
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,039
you're going to talk more in that

743
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,640
interview than you might talk all day

744
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,000
working from home looking for work

745
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,159
remotely your mouth will get dry that's

746
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,760
why i got the big glass of water because

747
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
i know from the experience my mouth is

748
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,279
going to get dry talking same thing for

749
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
the interview

750
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
unlike dating where the more they talk

751
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,799
about themselves the more they like you

752
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,080
because you talk about yourself they're

753
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,520
actually looking to hear you talk about

754
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
yourself

755
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,840
a friend said this in jest

756
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
plastic water bottles are noisy and

757
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
unstable just like the people that drink

758
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,400
from them during interviews

759
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,159
again getting very granular very

760
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,640
tactical

761
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,120
to be blunt you're out of the job

762
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
you have a laptop maybe two maybe three

763
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
or four depth maybe four but

764
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
get a laptop

765
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,600
so you've got this

766
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,440
two cent bottle of cop water from costco

767
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,600
you put it down here you're hoping that

768
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,799
it's not going to spill during your

769
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,320
interview you're hoping the structural

770
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,159
integrity of that is not going to knock

771
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,080
over and wipe out your laptop

772
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,679
because there's a feature built in if

773
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,039
you spill water on your laptop it'll

774
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,880
automatically turn off i think

775
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,200
you don't want again little things but

776
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
you don't want to have this happen

777
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,199
yeah being apolitical

778
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,720
you want to be that guy

779
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,919
he might want to watch that again or is

780
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,320
that cringy enough

781
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,720
point made

782
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
when you're setting up your meeting

783
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,159
you want to confirm why you're meeting

784
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,520
with a recruiter

785
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
you don't want to assume oh meet at nine

786
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
nine when nine pm bangkok time nine am

787
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,919
uh ugo wagodugu time

788
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
or we mean at nine p nine am eastern

789
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
confirm it get the details right show

790
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,840
you're a professional you don't want to

791
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,960
assume

792
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,360
also okay we're meeting at nine am on

793
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,799
zoom and we're going to assess the

794
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,480
senior cyber security manager role for

795
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,520
this company it also doesn't

796
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
corporations do another hiring managers

797
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
in the back corporations are often known

798
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,799
to bait and switch

799
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,120
we will advertise for this role but we

800
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
actually want you for this you want to

801
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,120
confirm what you're interviewing for to

802
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
see if it's actually a good fit

803
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,279
it saves your times it saves their time

804
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,880
it doesn't put you in awkward position

805
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
down the road

806
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
have a reconnection plan at the

807
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,080
beginning hey if we get disconnected for

808
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,320
any reason i'll hop back on zoom if

809
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,840
that's not working

810
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
i'll call you i'll text you but at least

811
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
be professional and have a reconnection

812
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
plan up front

813
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,640
another big one joe hudson brought up

814
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,960
was language

815
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,039
profanity is a deal breaker for most

816
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,279
hiring managers yes you may have been in

817
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,200
the marines you may have been in the

818
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
navy and you can

819
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
take the paint off a wall

820
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
but that's not appropriate for the

821
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,240
interview maybe afterwards when y'all

822
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
are out the bar with a hiring manager

823
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
celebrating getting hired sure but not

824
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,520
during the interview

825
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
you want to avoid colloquialisms

826
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
regional phrases and obscure references

827
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,000
example you don't want to be dennis

828
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
miller and you don't want to be dennis

829
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
leary you want to just be

830
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
normal just as if you're speaking with a

831
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,880
foreign national you want to have things

832
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
people understand

833
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,559
next two slides will show the difference

834
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,919
or do you want to focus during your

835
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,240
interview okay follow me

836
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,679
you've

837
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
human evolution when we talk and thank

838
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,919
you for making a little

839
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,440
bit of awkwardness but

840
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,919
here you go

841
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
you maintain eye contact this is how we

842
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,200
evolve we make right

843
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
but when you're looking at the

844
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,919
interviewer

845
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,360
you're doing like my old branch chief

846
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,039
pete he would just sit there and talk

847
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
like this they're seeing your forehead

848
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
because you're looking at their eyes on

849
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,600
the screen

850
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,679
not at the dot make sure you look at the

851
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,120
camera because

852
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
again i'm not pulling my phone out

853
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
you've seen the dating profiles or the

854
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
selfies on instagram and they're looking

855
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,919
at their phone

856
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
and congratulations you've told me what

857
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,960
model phone you have on what your face

858
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
looks like but you're gonna picture your

859
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,120
phone good job

860
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
be aware of that that's unnatural to

861
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
look at the camera dot

862
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
all right

863
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
that was the plain straight model no

864
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
weird references

865
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
as opposed to the warner brothers models

866
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
if you're not looking at dot when you

867
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
yakko you're wacko

868
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,679
so right there

869
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,520
anybody watch warner brothers

870
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,760
dated reference obscure a little bit

871
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,799
funny

872
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,640
but

873
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,320
straight down until chris is taking

874
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,960
pictures nice

875
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,159
so if they have this on the wall

876
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
building report it's

877
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
likability you want them to like you you

878
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,080
have interest in them you you you is

879
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,039
boring

880
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
them them them is interesting

881
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
hiring manager had this

882
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,919
and again for a osc challenge point

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,760
what can you tell me about this movie

884
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,120
other than it's a movie the poster that

885
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,600
doesn't count

886
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,919
speak up

887
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,080

oh

890
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,089
[Music]

891
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,399
so things you can do with this

892
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
how did that oh how does that compare to

893
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,919
the new movie do you like the newer

894
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
movies compared to the ones did you see

895
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
the one the 80s in the theater maybe a

896
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
little bit

897
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,640
age but

898
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,799
the other thing oh that was a horrific

899
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,640
movie that i saw in the theater they

900
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,480
killed all the main characters in the

901
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,080
first 10 minutes to introduce the new

902
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,760
toys

903
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,720
but

904
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
this is something just find a way oh did

905
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,960
you like that movie do you have a copy

906
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,200
of the vhs or dvd

907
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,640
something anything show interest in

908
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,799
their background because that shows

909
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,120
likability

910
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,799
now the hard questions this is more for

911
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
traditional hiring ground

912
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
learn to negotiate salary

913
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,799
if you say between x and y they're going

914
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,880
for the lowest possible cost

915
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,559
check in at the front desk and you say

916
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
he's nodding again you check check in at

917
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,080
the front desk oh sir your room's

918
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,200
between 25 and 500. how much you want to

919
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
pay

920
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,320
well what salary are you looking for

921
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,120
anywhere between 150 to 250. guess who's

922
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,200
getting offer 150 you are

923
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,399
oh yeah i'm looking in the 250

924
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,320
neighborhood even if they come back at

925
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,919
200

926
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,519
you're still up higher than your bottom

927
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,720
line because you didn't give them your

928
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,399
true bottom but that's something you

929
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,799
have to learn how to negotiate

930
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
ask for permission on this one awkward

931
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
questions and silences are where the

932
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,039
money is found

933
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,960
i was interviewing with a

934
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
former dream company

935
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,960
and it was okay here's our salary it's a

936
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
hundred percent remote cool

937
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
will it always be a hundred percent hard

938
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,200
question because i don't want the answer

939
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,440
no we want you to move to cupertino okay

940
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
will you adjust the salary

941
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,039
from tk south carolina to the bay area

942
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,559
no it won't change

943
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,720
okay

944
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
will you pay for relocation no this will

945
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,960
be out of pocket after the year okay

946
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,720
that's two strikes

947
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
will i get time off

948
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
for the move no you'll have to do this

949
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,039
on your own time three strikes right

950
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
there

951
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
and they said but you get 117 days off

952
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,720
per year

953
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,440
sounds good right

954
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
because you get saturday off

955
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
sunday off in the federal holidays

956
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,320
anybody here want to jump on that offer

957
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,840
no not a single person

958
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,840
hard questions i really wanted to work

959
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,679
for this company was insider threat

960
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,399
digital forensics big name company

961
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,320
but the salary and actually the benefits

962
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
were so bad i'd have been better off

963
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,080
just working at walmart rather than

964
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,000
trying to do this out west for that

965
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,480
salary

966
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,640
but if you don't ask you won't know and

967
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,720
you won't have an obstacle later to deal

968
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
with

969
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
some of the other common questions again

970
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,880

971
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,399

areas of your job you can't discuss the

1008
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
things you do that you can't bring up

1009
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,079
and that way i'll know not to ask them

1010
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,680
again in the interview one you're

1011
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,880
probably dealing with a foreign

1012
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
intelligence service not an actual

1013
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,359
interview that's a problem according to

1014
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
the fbi

1015
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,520
but be cognizant of what they're asking

1016
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,680
don't be so anxious to answer with the

1017
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,760
truth sometimes if you really can't

1018
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,680
because if you do have a clearance you

1019
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,440
have to be aware of this may not be

1020
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
someone that is truly an interviewer

1021
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
there are people you can pretend to be

1022
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
anyone on linkedin

1023
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,040
go to this person doesn't exist say you

1024
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
work for

1025
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,160
caught myself because we're being

1026
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,320
recorded you work for company all of a

1027
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,079
sudden you have the authoritative

1028
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,520
inherent trust that you really work

1029
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,359
there you want to please them get the

1030
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,960
job so you're offering up stuff that you

1031
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
wouldn't otherwise

1032
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,640
that is a very common tactic of foreign

1033
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,160
adversaries to get people who work in

1034
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,040
sensitive jobs to give up data

1035
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
so going back to that question

1036
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
tell me about a time you disagreed

1037
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,480
with your management or had to say no

1038
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,040
the star framework situation task action

1039
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
result

1040
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,720
the example i give and probably going to

1041
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,160
burn it after this having a recorded

1042
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,040
talk

1043
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
is we got a cable in

1044
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,280
country in africa said we need

1045
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,680
your team to do this thing in our

1046
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,000
country in three days

1047
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,880
we split the task half the team looked

1048
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
is it technically feasible to make it

1049
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,880
there the other half is it humanly

1050
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,440
possible to produce this result we found

1051
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
that regardless of who you are

1052
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,599
regardless of your color your passport

1053
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,520
they have a 30-day process to get the

1054
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,240
visa 30 business days not calendar days

1055
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,760
you have to go in person the embassy in

1056
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
dc sit in line get the visa and then

1057
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
wait to get over there

1058
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
we found that data

1059
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,040
found we could technically do the job

1060
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,680
but we can't get there so

1061
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,040
situation task the action was we had the

1062
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
data compiled the result i went back to

1063
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,880
leadership and said

1064
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,440
we can't do this by law we cannot get

1065
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,240
into their country fast enough here's

1066
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,079
how we will solve the problem if you're

1067
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
amenable to offering the solution

1068
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,320
solutions offered it's legal we're not

1069
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
breaking any international law to get

1070
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,760
there because we really don't want to

1071
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,280
get people killed for doing your job you

1072
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
have to abide by their rules it's a good

1073
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
example shows research accountability in

1074
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,720
the way you mitigate no one to a yes

1075
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,839
anyone familiar with a field found

1076
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,520
model no

1077
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,960
right out of college i was working in

1078
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,359
banking for a suntrust bank

1079
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,760
now truest whatever the heck that is

1080
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,000
and it was the to overcome objections

1081
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,839
yeah i wouldn't do it now but i'm out of

1082
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,920
college i need a job

1083
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,200
selling loan insurance complete profit

1084
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,520
for the bank so that you're paying money

1085
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
so that if anything happens to you the

1086
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
bank's insurance covers the bank so loan

1087
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,320
to you

1088
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
but we get a nice commission was like 30

1089
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,839
alone

1090
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,560
so

1091
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,640
yeah

1092
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,560
mr smith i understand

1093
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,960
how you feel about buying loan insurance

1094
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,800
i used to feel the same way but then i

1095
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
found working with so many clients like

1096
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,320
yourself and after hearing accidents

1097
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,240
happen and the insurance covered that

1098
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,640
bill so that their new whatever

1099
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,320
the loan was covered they didn't have to

1100
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
worry not while they're in the hospital

1101
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
we found that was the best solution for

1102
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,440
peace of mind and that's how you

1103
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,560
manipulate the no into a yes you know i

1104
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
used to feel that way about this

1105
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
technology that i found after some

1106
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
training

1107
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
that i like the other product better

1108
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,119
take it for what you will use it as you

1109
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,359
need but it's a good pivot to get off a

1110
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,760
sticky situation

1111
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,240
your questions are a reflection of you

1112
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,920
of your mindset

1113
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
so again doing digital forensic behavior

1114
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,079
analysis

1115
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,520
it's

1116
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,599
the good questions are here what can i

1117
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,520
do on the first day what are the skills

1118
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,040
of a good teammate

1119
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,720
what software suite do you use for this

1120
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
task who would i engage with daily is it

1121
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,320
internal stakeholders external clients

1122
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,839
what are the biggest hurdles and

1123
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,160
challenges blockers for this role

1124
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
why are you hiring for this role and

1125
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
again

1126
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,760
nate from amazon gave me this he said

1127
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,320
the big red flags are oh we're expanding

1128
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
into this market green flag that's good

1129
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,119
we've had a large number of resignations

1130
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,520
in this department red flag bag maybe

1131
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
you want to bail on that interview but

1132
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
that's a fair question to ask why are

1133
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,599
you hiring

1134
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,320
when i got

1135
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,000
cleared to get the job at ciao i was

1136
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,079
talking to a person who was a former

1137
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,040
army crypto custodian

1138
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
the quotes up there you apologize for

1139
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
the wall of text if you know how to do

1140
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,040
our sensitive processes where everything

1141
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,200
is stored know our procedures know where

1142
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,359
our safe is no before all this before

1143
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,000
you start you're not a unicorn of a hire

1144
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,839
you're a security concern and we don't

1145
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,440
want you on the job

1146
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,119
you're not getting handling classified

1147
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,760
materials for dummies at target

1148
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
you have to have an onboarding process

1149
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
and it's fair to ask how can i get up to

1150
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
speed the companies that say we're

1151
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,920
looking for a self-starter

1152
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
i don't know where all the tools are i

1153
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,720
don't know the drives the directory the

1154
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
process doing digital forensics it does

1155
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
get into the legal process i want to do

1156
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,280
it right for this company

1157
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
going back to the question of what tools

1158
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,720
you use for digital forensics oh we only

1159
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,880
use one tool kit

1160
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,359
anybody no problem with that

1161
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,440
two is one one is none trust but verify

1162
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
so if you're only using in case and not

1163
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
verifying the output with black light or

1164
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,400
axiom

1165
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,000
you may have found this is a false

1166
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
positive and the true negative is over

1167
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,880
here that would exonerate the case of

1168
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,400
the client and this is just an

1169
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,599
apparition

1170
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,640
so as a digital forensic practitioner i

1171
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,880
wouldn't want that job but if i don't

1172
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
ask upfront about that for the

1173
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
onboarding process

1174
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,520
i'm not going to know this is a major

1175
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,640
problem right up front there was

1176
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,319
somebody we worked with who saw that

1177
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,079
with a major company

1178
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,760
she cut off a process right there for

1179
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
personal liability because at the end of

1180
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,599
the day the individual examiner who

1181
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,760
signed that affidavit was responsible

1182
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,920
that this wasn't accurate but through

1183
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,440
limitations you're on the hook for it

1184
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,839
the axiom if you failed to plan you plan

1185
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,839
to fail

1186
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,800
and one of our volunteers at osce

1187
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
el martinez

1188
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
she has a presentation it's okay to be

1189
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,760
new you are new to the company it's okay

1190
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,920
to ask questions and on board you're not

1191
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,200
going to drop in and know where

1192
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280

1193
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,359

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,319
the skills assessment

1209
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,240
anyone been asked to do free work before

1210
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,440

1212
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,240
anyone else

1213
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,839
you know do some coding force it's not a

1214
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,200
program process improvement

1215
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,839
depends on

1216
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,480
i'm torn

1217
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,319
i don't want to do the work for free but

1218
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,640
i want to validate my skills so i don't

1219
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
feel good saying yes reddit anti-work

1220
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,400
reddit recruiting hell says don't do it

1221
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,599
send them an invoice if you don't get

1222
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,760
the job

1223
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,240
if you all were asked southern

1224
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,920
if you're asked to do this for free for

1225
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,800
this project would you do it show hands

1226
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,599
to validate maybe

1227
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,880
one maybe

1228
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
everyone else is a no yes you would do

1229
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,040
it

1230
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
let's see if i can not poke your eye out

1231
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,720
yeah i didn't practice that but

1232
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,920
that's something you're going to have to

1233
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,560
consider am i going to think 16 20 hours

1234
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
of coding into a project for a job i may

1235
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,839
not get that they're going to

1236
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,520
incorporate production

1237
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,920
my value as a outside consultant is x

1238
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,680
per hour and i'm giving this many

1239
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
thousands of dollars of labor for free

1240
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
just to

1241
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,119
a lot of unethical corporations will use

1242
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,200
that free labor to solve problems

1243
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,480
without hiring outside consultants

1244
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,040
interviews over

1245
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,960
if it went well

1246
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,800
and you feel good comfortable everything

1247
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,440
went like that cannot talk everything

1248
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,640
went well

1249
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,800
send the email thank you ask about next

1250
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,160
steps if there's anything you need to

1251
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,960
clarify hey i misspoke

1252
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,839
ft

1253
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,359
fpp port number is this sftp is that i

1254
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,040
confused it to you during the process i

1255
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,640
realized that after we hung up

1256
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,800
acknowledge your mistake

1257
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,200
and mitigate the damage

1258
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,359
if it's not a good fit like the example

1259
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,960
from the insider risk company backing

1260
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,560
cupertino

1261
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,040
hey i appreciate your time that i'm

1262
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,839
withdrawing myself in the process

1263
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,520
good luck with your search and future

1264
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,119
endeavors or whatever acronym they like

1265
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,520
to use firm final and fair your name's

1266
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,680
off the list they don't get to ghost you

1267
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,599
because you don't want to work there

1268
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,880
it's okay to say no and from the

1269
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,160
domestic

1270
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,079
abuse briefing we give

1271
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,480
you don't need permission to avoid a bad

1272
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
situation no bad situation ever got

1273
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,839
better by sticking around

1274
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,040
if it didn't go well

1275
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,640
don't get on reddit and post all the

1276
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,040
gory details yet you want to secure that

1277
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,920
job example being this is a small

1278
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,359
community

1279
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,800
because we're probably only two or three

1280
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,240
degrees from each of us knowing each

1281
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,839
other

1282
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,880
and your heads are nodding

1283
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,640
human resources and hiring managers are

1284
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,319
probably pretty much the same like

1285
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,160
attracts like soldiers kill soldiers

1286
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,079
tanks kill tanks sub skill subs airplane

1287
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,880
skill airplanes

1288
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
infosec meets with infosec

1289
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,280
hr deals with hr so if they have a

1290
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,520
horrific candidate they're going to say

1291
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,560
dude

1292
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
there's this one guy

1293
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
and it's going to be out there you don't

1294
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
want to do that

1295
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,599
again the red letters

1296
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,040
after the interview remember to take

1297
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,960
your phone off of airplane mode remember

1298
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,280
to re-enable your notifications because

1299
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,200
again this is to take home if you want

1300
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
to remind you oh yeah because you're

1301
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,960
stressed you're looking for work

1302
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,040
you're a bad situation at work very

1303
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,119
excited about that but things happen you

1304
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,839
forget the little details we're all

1305
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,920
human except jeff suffer mark zuckerberg

1306
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
i wonder about him but

1307
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,839
i acknowledge this is basic and common

1308
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,000
sense i thorough it not but if it's

1309
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,520
common sense and you forget it was it

1310
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,599
really common sense

1311
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,920
if you ask others to look at your resume

1312
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,359
to help you coach with the interview

1313
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,160
process are you asking for help are you

1314
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,000
asking for people to pre-validate your

1315
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,319
or validate your preconceived notions

1316
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,119
one person asked for help

1317
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
several of us gave it yeah but someone

1318
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
else told me no well why did you ask me

1319
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,480
because we're telling you this isn't

1320
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,240
going to work your mcsc from 1999 is

1321
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,319
really cool congratulations that's not

1322
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,319
relevant in 2022

1323
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,400
i would take it off your resume yes i

1324
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
know you worked hard for it no one's

1325
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,440
using iis and proxy server

1326
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,119
i take that back because i am talking

1327
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,119
the voting machine village and the

1328
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,839
machine i analyzed was office 97

1329
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,280
database so never mind all that said

1330
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,200
there are advantages because you don't

1331
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,560
have to

1332
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,359
get up make an excuse to go to

1333
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,440
to take a day off of work you don't have

1334
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,760
to go out

1335
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,599
you don't have to iron your suit look

1336
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,119
for parking

1337
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,200
there are a lot of advantages for remote

1338
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,240
interviews

1339
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,359
like seriously when's the last time

1340
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,078
y'all wore a suit

1341
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,440
been a while

1342
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,040
the tldr remove your unnecessary devices

1343
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,720
from the network for the interview

1344
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
you want to silence your alerts you want

1345
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
to make eye contact with the interviewer

1346
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,880
at the little dot look at dot when you

1347
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,560
yakko

1348
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,359
remember the star model

1349
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,000
my twitter account is

1350
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,160
generally clean it's not political it's

1351
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,599
right down the middle here's pictures of

1352
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,359
deer here's some antiques i found here's

1353
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,440
some rare stuff every so often there's

1354
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,680
infosec but it

1355
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,920
if it was put before court of law and

1356
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,280
read to my parents i wouldn't be

1357
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,560
embarrassed by what's on there

1358
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
so like a good marvel fan there's an

1359
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
after

1360
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,079
if as a

1361
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,680
insider risk

1362
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,200
threat analyst

1363
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,800
working for a company during the

1364
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,440
pandemic unnamed

1365
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,200
never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever

1366
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,680
ever ever search for new jobs from your

1367
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,559
corporate devices

1368
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,680
no

1369
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,200
will's not joking

1370
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,800
i it

1371
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,839
if a packet went from linkedin to your

1372
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,480
device then on the splunk dashboard that

1373
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
improv that increase your risk

1374
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,119
if you have emails with acceptance job

1375
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,200
offer resignation

1376
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,960
now you're on a list of an insider

1377
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,000
threat i investigated this that's why

1378
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,920
i'm doing cti now and not forensics you

1379
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,119
need a break from forensics

1380
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,280
they are going to put you under the eye

1381
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,960
of sauron if they start thinking you're

1382
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,240
going to leave because you're working

1383
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,559
with proprietary classified sensitive

1384
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,480
and they know you're leaving they're

1385
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,000
watching to see what you take out the

1386
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,599
door

1387
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,920
snowden um

1388
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
the vault 7

1389
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,040
it it's people are now looking at this

1390
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,160
the consent to monitoring is real

1391
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,680
has anybody worked inside a threat right

1392
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,440
because

1393
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,559
these four tools with splunk

1394
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,480
network traffic in a heavy regulated

1395
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,040
industry log on dates times badge access

1396
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,559
i can see when you say brb

1397
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,720
going for coffee and then you badge out

1398
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,559
of the building and go to your car for

1399
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:47,520
an hour

1400
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,079
and then come back in

1401
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,359
if i'm not because i'm not petty but

1402
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,280
a manager could say that's time card

1403
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,319
fraud because you had an hour for lunch

1404
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,599
you took your hour for lunch and then

1405
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,800
you went to a car

1406
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,319
knowing that you're leaving the eye of

1407
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,920
swords upon you

1408
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,520

discussing

1415
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,119

very last thing

1452
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,599
when you're engaging

1453
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,480
a red team for pin test

1454
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,400
they meet you on teams guess what they

1455
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,079

tied with just a little garden hose to a

1500
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,720
steak

1501
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,240
and they would say i've been there i

1502
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,079
love the country they would say why does

1503
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,920
the elephant not move

1504
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,160
well as a baby elephant they secure it

1505
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,640
with heavy leg irons heavy chain

1506
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,200
to a stake embedded in the ground so

1507
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,359
over time the elephant grows and is

1508
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,760
acclimated to think i can't do anything

1509
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,200
more than this the elephant grows and

1510
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,839
he's far stronger than anything

1511
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,160
he knows but his mind thinks i can only

1512
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,760
i can't move that's not even going to

1513
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,880
try

1514
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,319
if you're in a toxic environment they

1515
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,559
constantly brow beat you run you down

1516
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,079
all of your work isn't good enough

1517
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,760
you've now got two three four years

1518
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,839
experience on this topic you're far

1519
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,440
better than when you first started you

1520
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,520
naturally got more experience

1521
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,680
you're far stronger than you realize and

1522
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,520
it's okay to leave that bad job for

1523
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,119
something else for something better

1524
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,880
don't let the toxic environment in

1525
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,040
former

1526
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
treatment hold you down and hold you

1527
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,800
back i wasn't going to have an elephant

1528
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,400
picture but ran out of time

1529
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,800
so anyway the talk is over it was a

1530
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,359
higher ground

1531
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,920
have a minute thank you

1532
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,440
yes

1533
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,250
[Applause]

1534
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,319
[Music]

1535
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,760
interviewer

1536
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,280
he asked if there are any tips for the

1537
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,920
interviewer

1538
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,400
it depends on the role you want to do

1539
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,640
see if they're a good fit see if they

1540
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,079
want to work a remote see if they want

1541
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,920
to work on site

1542
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,520
interest hobbies get to know him as a

1543
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,880
person i mean

1544
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,480
regardless of all the tech skills you're

1545
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,880
going to work with him daily

1546
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,559
you know you don't want to hire somebody

1547
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,480
that rocks the boat to cause drama no

1548
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,640
one really wants that you want to see if

1549
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,960
just basic personality the tech skills

1550
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,240
can be learned

1551
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,240
but the personality that's if they think

1552
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,359
they're the rockstar they're the

1553
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,359
solution we had a guy walk into a new

1554
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:06,800
platform and said

1555
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,480
yeah i'm here to solve everything for

1556
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,720
you they had a wheels up party when he

1557
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,400
left they were so happy he was gone to

1558
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,680
another division because he was so

1559
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,880
arrogant

1560
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,839
so

1561
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,920
it's all about the people tech skills

1562
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,160
can be they're fungible i mean you've

1563
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,319
specialized in dial up modems 25 years

1564
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
ago and now look we got this

1565
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
you're welcome so this is going to be

1566
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,440
really hard for me to say but if you go

1567
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,960
on youtube

1568
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,839
on the b-sides lv

1569
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,400
channel and you look at previous years

1570
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,880
presentations there's a gentleman named

1571
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,319
mike murray

1572
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,839
and he always did the first talk on the

1573
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,119
second day and his talk was always about

1574
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,839
managing people managing superstars how

1575
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,079
do you interview how do you cultivate

1576
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,640
them i apologize but mike is no longer

1577
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,680
with us

1578
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,640
so

1579
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,160
it's very hard for me to talk about him

1580
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,880
but he had some really really great

1581
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,119
presentations so they're all on the

1582
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,559
besides lv channel

1583
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,280
how does the remote process change so

1584
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,920
all of his same tips

1585
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,160
really be need to be done by the hiring

1586
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,839
manager as well

1587
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,720
so um one thing that i talk about with

1588
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,960
my customers a lot is the recruiters

1589
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,680
need to train their hiring managers on

1590
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,160
how to do remote interviews you know

1591
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,520
giving them the background on the

1592
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,760
candidate giving them the background on

1593
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,319
the team making sure that the hiring

1594
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,119
manager doing the remote interview knows

1595
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,200
all the tech knows the background knows

1596
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,400
how to have

1597
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,760
personality

1598
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,440
on the the um interview because you're

1599
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,359
you're establishing a rapport you're

1600
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,040
established you're cultivating this

1601
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
candidate and that's really hard to do

1602
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,799
in a remote environment when you don't

1603
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,280
have body language so basically

1604
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,359
everything that will said

1605
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,599
you need to do as well

1606
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,599
as a hiring manager having your

1607
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,400
notifications off and you know really

1608
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,839
checking to make sure that you have a

1609
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,480
backup plan if you get disconnected and

1610
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,760
checking with your recruiter i know

1611
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,119
we've got

1612
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,200
three great recruiters over here and

1613
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,520
several other recruiters there who have

1614
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,760
more than 20 years experience well maybe

1615
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,920
not jamal

1616
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,880
but they all have really these are all

1617
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
recruiters that i have cultivated over

1618
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,960
20 years of my experience and they have

1619
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,599
all prepped their hiring managers so i'm

1620
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,599
