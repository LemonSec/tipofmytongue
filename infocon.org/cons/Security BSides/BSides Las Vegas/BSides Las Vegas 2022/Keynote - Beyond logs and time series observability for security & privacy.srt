1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
without further ado

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
we have our keynote speaker for day two

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,200
this is

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,359
amanda walker i've had the privilege to

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,800
work with her across a couple of

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,320
different companies now

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
and

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,280
i for some reason she still takes my

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,800
phone calls and uh agreed

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
to come talk to us about something

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,000
that's i think pretty exciting uh and uh

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
i will ask you all to put your hands

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
together for amanda walker

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,359
and uh let's hear what you have to say

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,160
[Applause]

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
thanks a lot uh the slides were working

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
early there we go okay

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,200
hello everyone uh my name is amanda

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
walker uh and i'm gonna talk a little

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
bit about

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,879
logs and time series beyond logs in time

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,200
series uh and observability in for

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
security and privacy use cases

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,480
uh i'll start out with a little bit of

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,039
an intro um i'm currently at google

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
leading applied research for privacy

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
safety and security before that during

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
the pandemic i spent a few years uh

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
working for a small company called nuna

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
which gave me the other end of the

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,840
spectrum from google of a 150 person

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
company with a 10 person infrastructure

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
and security team um done some work on a

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,000
host of prior companies uh some

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
some of which i've met some of you

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
but i want to make one one important

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
statement here is i am

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,119
while i currently work at google this

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,200
talk is not about google so this is not

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,520
a story of how we do things there

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,280
a bunch of the principles i'll talk

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,159
about

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,640
are ones we do apply but i'm not going

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
into

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
tooling things like that this is

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,840
more of a

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
trying to get

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
some guidelines on how to think about

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
observability from a security standpoint

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,840
and through a security lens uh

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
regardless of what tooling you're on

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
regardless of what platform you're on

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,520
so

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
talk a little bit about observability i

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,399
know some of you are familiar with the

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
concept but it's something that's gotten

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
very popular in the sre community

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,119
where

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,719
basic you know traditional logging and

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
monitoring is no longer really

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
sufficient

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,880
and so

63
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
reframing of how you keep track of a

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,878
system in production and understand what

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,318
it's doing

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,760
has sprung up under this term

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
observability this came from control

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
theory and if you go to wikipedia you

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,319
get a nice control theory definition

70
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
which is you know how well internal

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
states of a system can be inferred from

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
knowledge of external inputs and really

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,959
what that means is you can tell what's

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
going on without having to stop and take

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
it apart

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
you're not just looking at

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
looking at things from the outside

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
so

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
how do we do that

80
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
um

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
the first place to start is logs

82
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,519
we're all familiar with those they

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
record what happens they tend to be

84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
events that happened in the past

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
and they're used for evidence after the

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,480
fact

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
you don't you can't prevent anything

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,239
with a log it merely tells you some

89
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,080
things that happened so that you can go

90
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,760
try to reconstruct

91
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,799
uh how you got there

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
building on top of

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
logs are alerts which are more timely

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
this is something that fires uh

95
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
well 20 conditions met and i'm just

96
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,959
defining these as this terminology so

97
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,159
that

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,519
we all understand what i'm what i'm

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
saying for each of these

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,760
and the learning criteria are always uh

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
specified in advance there's something

102
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
you expect to happen or are worried will

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,959
happen

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,040
and so you write an alerting rule that

105
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
uh that fires when that when those

106
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
conditions are met

107
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,560
usually triggering triggering some kind

108
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
of process

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
based on that

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,440
and these two have been you know

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,879
thoroughly used

112
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
in production in security over many

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,519
years

114
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
most platforms come with

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,599
logging alerting

116
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
centralizing that has been

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,599
an entire sub industry

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,280
for a while

119
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
but that still doesn't give you

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,640
a lot of information in the moment

121
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,200
maybe

122
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,599
10 15 years ago

123
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,959
people started thinking more in terms of

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,799
telemetry rather than recording events

125
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,480
that happened

126
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,439
get snapshots of a systems state

127
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,920
at a given point in time do that at

128
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
repeated time intervals so you can see

129
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,839
trends over time

130
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
time series databases became very

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,840
popular at this point so things like

132
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
prometheus and

133
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,560
systems like that that can store things

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
over over a lot of time

135
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
let you perform queries either

136
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,440
by time or by signal draw pretty graphs

137
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
on them things like that this

138
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
revolutionized

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
revolutionized monitoring because you

140
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
could you could sort of see the state as

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
it was progressing you could see request

142
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,199
counts climbing you could see latency

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,600
increasing before it hit some alerting

144
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
threshold

145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
and the big innovation here was that

146
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,639
the logging and learning conditions were

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
separated from gathering the data

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
traditionally in logs you know you

149
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
admitted you emit a log statement in

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
code you say if sessions have just

151
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
happened or if i'm running if i hit this

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
function

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
you made a log statement

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,320
or test a condition and generate an

155
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
alert that way

156
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
very hard to change

157
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
required pushing a new binary all of

158
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
that

159
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,240
if you instrument something with metrics

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
and then have a engine running on top of

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
that looking at the metrics coming into

162
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
your time time series

163
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
you're going to separate that you can

164
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
tune metrics you can silence alerts

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
you can create new ones without having

166
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
to push something new into production

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
things like that

168
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
because this is capturing behavior not

169
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
just state

170
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
you can see how the how the state

171
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
evolves over time and deduce things from

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
that so this is sort of a step more

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
abstract

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
but it's still slicing things across

175
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,240
time

176
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,880
and so you get a snapshot and you get

177
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
another snapshot and you get another

178
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
snapshot

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
and you still kind of have to stitch

180
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
things together

181
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,240
so if you're looking for more

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
granularity then okay what's the load on

183
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
my server or how many api calls per

184
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
second am i getting things like that

185
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,160
um

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
i need to move

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
slice things in a different way

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,400
tracing is the most recent of these

189
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
approaches

190
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
and this is really what

191
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
most most

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
companies and most organizations that

193
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
are focused on observability

194
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
take as one of the distinguishing pieces

195
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,919
which is tracing slices across a context

196
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
instead of time so you can follow the

197
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
path of a request

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
okay i've got a

199
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
request hits my web server

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
which of the dozens of micro services

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
that i am running does this request flow

202
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
through does the data come back through

203
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
what credentials are used you can follow

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
things like that and so it's

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
much more focused on

206
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,000
causal relationships

207
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
so

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,479
request came in did this did a database

209
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,400
look up did that and so on

210
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
this is useful for debugging this is

211
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
useful for

212
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
troubleshooting problems that are that

213
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
are happening right now

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
and it

215
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,479
is

216
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
these three these three pieces are

217
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,120
usually called the three pillars of

218
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
observability or sometimes melt

219
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
which is

220
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
metrics events uh logs and uh traces

221
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,360
um

222
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,440
you'll hear a lot about that um

223
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,280
these are these are these are the basic

224
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
pieces of it and

225
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,080
what all of this gives you when you

226
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
combine all of these is something very

227
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,919
important

228
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
which is you can start to answer

229
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
questions about your system with queries

230
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
rather than investigations

231
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
one of the challenges of

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
working in security especially on

233
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,000
defense is

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,919
it can be very hard to figure out what

235
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,520
happened

236
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
something happens you get evidence of

237
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
something

238
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
you know an event

239
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,240
and then you have to go back and

240
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,960
reconstruct and you can often have to

241
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,919
interview

242
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,800
engineers go look at code it's very time

243
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,360
and time intensive process

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
if you can query these things from the

245
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,759
system

246
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,879
directly

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
that reduces a lot of toil

248
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
that increases your ability to stay

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
focused on the problem

250
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
uh visualize what's going on and so on

251
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,680
and

252
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
questions are situational they're not

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
known in advance you know they're not

254
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
something you could have run you could

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
have written an alert to anticipate

256
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,039
you couldn't have written a log analysis

257
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
pipeline to surface the things they're

258
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
questions you have right now often based

259
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
on questions you just asked and got got

260
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
some answer to

261
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
and so you

262
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
you can anticipate what types of

263
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,760
questions you need to ask though so

264
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680
things like pivots and joins

265
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,440
so

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,839
i've got something i've got a suspicious

267
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,880
specific

268
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
suspicious session going on it's like

269
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
okay

270
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
joe has not logged in from singapore

271
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
he's based in new york

272
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
this might be a suspicious session i

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,360
want to look at his credential i want to

274
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
say okay

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
what was that credential used for since

276
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
time x or in this user session so you're

277
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
pivoting on that you may want to pivot

278
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
on the geolocation and say okay is there

279
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
other suspicious activity coming in from

280
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
there

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
all of these kinds of things are very

282
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
sort of data analysis tool-centric

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,360
they're things that are haven't been

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
traditionally applied in a general

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,519
generic fashion

286
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
to production data to

287
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
security data until recently you also

288
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
want to do expansion and narrowing of

289
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
scope

290
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,839
if you try to look at all of your

291
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,320
traffic or all of your activity

292
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
in a very complex system especially when

293
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
distributed across

294
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
a lot of different services

295
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
it can be very hard to see signals in

296
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,440
the noise and so the ability to expand

297
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
or narrow scope as you have more

298
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
questions as you do these kinds of

299
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,560
pivots and joins

300
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,279
um it's very important

301
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
you want to say okay i want to focus

302
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,279
just on

303
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,600
just on this session just on this user

304
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,120
credential just on this type of user

305
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
credential just on this subsystem

306
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
and see where all of the requests coming

307
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
in and out of it are uh things like that

308
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
and

309
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
visualizing this helps a lot um we all

310
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
have eyes you know we've probably all

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
had times that ours have glazed over

312
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
reading log messages scrolling through

313
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
things trying to keep track of what is

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,079
what we're looking at

315
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
and so the ability to take these kinds

316
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,800
of queries and visualize them is

317
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
important

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
um

319
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,760
and one of the

320
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
things that i've noticed in working with

321
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
teams that are responsible for both

322
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
production and reliability and security

323
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
is

324
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,760
operational queries and security queries

325
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,560
often cover the same data but they ask

326
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
different questions about it

327
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
and this is

328
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
this is part of what i'm

329
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
what i want you to take away with is

330
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
some of these tools are aimed at

331
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
different kinds of tasks than than we

332
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,880
have as

333
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
as us people responsible for security

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
but

335
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
you can use those tools

336
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
you can give it you know if you add some

337
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
data to it you can then make it useful

338
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
gain a lot of these benefits

339
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,720
and i'll

340
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
let's see we've got a tool thing okay

341
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
there is a proliferation of tooling for

342
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,959
observability there are whole startups

343
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,640
that are focused on this there are a lot

344
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,760
of open source projects

345
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,600
there's stuff about code understanding

346
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
if you go and search for observability

347
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,279
on the web you'll see lots of flashy

348
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,040
screen dumps of uh

349
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,920
you know

350
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
dashboards and graphs and charts and

351
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
things and you know

352
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040
aimed at aimed at the executive that's

353
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,639
going to write the check to go license

354
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
the product more than the engineer

355
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,040
that's going to use it sometimes

356
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,959
but

357
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
where tools can go beyond that and

358
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
integrate integrate with your security

359
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
event incident management system

360
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
integrate with developer tools

361
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
so that

362
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
people don't have to do extra work

363
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,600
to make stuff visible in the in the

364
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
either visible into the observability

365
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,600
framework or pull stuff out of it

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
that's the better

367
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,200
incident management in particular is an

368
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,480
area where unifying

369
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
security incident response and

370
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
production incident response can be very

371
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
very fruitful

372
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,720
that said

373
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
in my experience this works best at

374
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,160
small companies where everyone has a

375
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
fair amount of situational awareness it

376
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
does not work as well with huge sre

377
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
organizations and huge huge security

378
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
organizations coming together

379
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
i have stories about that

380
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,199
more appropriate for other venues

381
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
but the kinds of defects that cause

382
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,839
security problems and cause production

383
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
problems and cause just

384
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,240
bugs in business logic etc are all all

385
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
very similar and so you can apply some

386
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
of this tooling to all of those you just

387
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,040
have to know the right questions to ask

388
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,480
so

389
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
i've now been whoop i've now done a

390
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,040
bunch of sort of explain why this the

391
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
observability as an approach is a good a

392
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
good thing um as with everything nothing

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
is an unmixed blessing

394
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
there are costs and benefits

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
let's start with some benefits you know

396
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
as i was just saying

397
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,279
there's

398
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
better you can have better alignment

399
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
between devops devops and secops you

400
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,519
know if your

401
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,800
uh

402
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,720
developers and your security people and

403
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
your production support are all using

404
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
the same tools they're all looking at

405
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,880
the same thing they can just say send a

406
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
link to someone saying hey can you look

407
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
at this

408
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,399
that can reduce a lot of confusion

409
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
require many fewer meetings things like

410
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
that

411
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,360
the other interesting thing is that

412
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,199
given you know collecting this data

413
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,240
making it available via apis

414
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
being able to issue queries against it

415
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,480
is useful for automation as well as

416
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
people

417
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
just like you can write an alert

418
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,079
once you've got

419
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
data coming in and being stored as a

420
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
time series and you can do of behavioral

421
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
alerts you do the same thing with uh

422
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,519
with an observability system

423
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
and those can get much more abstract so

424
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,079
you can you can narrow the scope you can

425
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,959
be

426
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
pretty specific on

427
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
okay you know when this very unlikely

428
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
set of things happens

429
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,320
you know we get a

430
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,720
latency spike on this trace back to

431
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
whatever your incoming

432
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,839
traffic was

433
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,279
um you can write much you can write

434
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,800
better rules that are more

435
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
understandable than you can just doing

436
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
going just on data

437
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,639
this is also where a lot of

438
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,839
organizations are trying to apply

439
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
machine learning you know once you have

440
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
this labeled data about what's going on

441
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
inside your system it's like okay are

442
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,720
there patterns humans are not going to

443
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
see

444
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
looking for things like high latency or

445
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
error rates or

446
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,199
unusual accesses and stuff is

447
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
something humans are pretty good at but

448
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,959
some of this is pretty subtle especially

449
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
if you in a security

450
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
situation where you have an attacker

451
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
who's trying not to be seen

452
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
so being able to

453
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
apply

454
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
larger scale pattern discovery pattern

455
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
matching uh is fruitful although

456
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,480
a lot of this is is pretty new it's it

457
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
it's it's exploratory there are a lot of

458
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,720
there's some products out there so we're

459
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
applying

460
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,839
ml to

461
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,519
to observability this will this will

462
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,720
solve your problems this will show you

463
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
what you need to do they're not they

464
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
they magnify what humans can do they

465
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,240
free up human attention for the more

466
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
significant uh

467
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,120
more significant signals more

468
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,959
significant power patterns bringing

469
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
patterns to human attention to act sort

470
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
of as the exception handler rather than

471
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,720
crawling through analyzing all of that

472
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
data

473
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,839
many of these many of

474
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,279
them many observability systems come

475
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,360
with visualization tools

476
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,160
that

477
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
you can use when you need to explain

478
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
what's happened to somebody in a

479
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,399
post-mortem or an executive briefing or

480
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
things like that where

481
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,399
someone who hasn't had their head stuck

482
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,240
in this problem for the last week or the

483
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
last several hours or

484
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,120
whatever

485
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
needs to know uh

486
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
at least the basics of what happened

487
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,040
what the consequences were

488
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
what the impact was uh what was done to

489
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
mitigate it

490
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
similarly to that

491
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
it's nice when you're sitting down with

492
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
an auditor for your soccer 2 or fedramp

493
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,839
or whatever audit

494
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,000
and they ask questions about what your

495
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,480
system does it's it's really nice to say

496
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
well we have an automated system for

497
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
that here

498
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
let me show you and issue queries show

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,759
results

500
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
uh visualize them in a in a way that

501
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
they can see and they can see that it's

502
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,199
not you know someone

503
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,880
manually collated a bunch of stuff into

504
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
excel and

505
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
generated a report from that

506
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,559
all of these things are good

507
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
there are let's see

508
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,839
there are

509
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
costs as well there are there's a flip

510
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
side to everything

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,199
if you have a

512
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,760
system set up where you can do dynamic

513
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,679
tracing for example where you can start

514
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,360
to monitor state

515
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
or even effect control flow without

516
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
monitoring a binary you know using

517
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,480
something like dtrace or bpf things like

518
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,919
that

519
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,360
that's really useful for doing

520
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
non-intrusive

521
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
data gathering

522
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
but of course it's also useful

523
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
it's useful for non-intrusive data

524
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
gathering by

525
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
people or agents that you don't want to

526
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
be able to do that

527
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,799
some of the capabilities that have been

528
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,400
put in place for

529
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
observability like kernel tracing

530
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,520
uh

531
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
things in standard libraries things like

532
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,400
that

533
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
also mean that

534
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,440
there are new kinds of malware that are

535
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
harder to detect that don't show up if

536
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,679
you are looking doing static analysis of

537
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,640
a binary and so access to some of these

538
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
capabilities

539
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
needs to be treated carefully

540
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,240
it's the equivalent of root access in

541
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
many cases and so

542
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
how you deploy it within an organization

543
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
how you track use of it uh how do you

544
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
how you detect use it becomes sort of a

545
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
meta problem

546
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
uh you know who watches the watchers is

547
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
always going to be with us as a

548
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
challenge

549
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,280
another aspect that i've seen pop up

550
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,520
two or three times now is it gives you

551
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,919
an illusion of completeness

552
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,320
now you've got this product

553
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
it gives you a a single pane of glass

554
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
thing it's a buzz phrase that i've been

555
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
hearing it shows you all your

556
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,720
operational state

557
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,840
all of the things you need to worry

558
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
about all the things you need to pay

559
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,919
attention to one place

560
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,400
you can feel as though okay now i know

561
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
what's going on

562
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,039
uh

563
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,840
that's usually not true

564
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,640
systems these days are complex enough

565
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,559
that no single person is going to know

566
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
everything that's going to go on

567
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,679
and everything that is in fact

568
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,200
significant to them

569
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
so

570
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
if you're looking at

571
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
adopting some of this these tools that

572
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
have been been written by

573
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,360
companies or or open source

574
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
make sure that they can answer the

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,559
question that you know you'll need to

576
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,360
answer make sure it's not just hi this

577
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,840
is sort of dashboards v2 lots of lots of

578
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
pretty graphics

579
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
make sure that

580
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
they can magnify your ability to

581
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,160
answer questions

582
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,000
do things that you know do things that

583
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
you need to do to find out what's going

584
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
on inside the system

585
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
help you build systems

586
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,720
where that comes along

587
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
there's an illusion of well you'll get

588
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
observability for free if you adopt our

589
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
sdk or if you adopt our platform you

590
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
know every cloud platform has

591
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
these days has tracing facilities has

592
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
metrics gathering all of that

593
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
make sure that

594
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
you can you can use that

595
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
make sure that

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
not just sort of taking it for granted

597
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,120
of okay

598
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,520
this is gathering stuff

599
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
i'm all set

600
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
uh and beware of buzzwords of the day uh

601
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,280
a lot of things have gotten lumped into

602
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
observability that are kind of log

603
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,679
analysis to traditional log analysis

604
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,520
with with a new label stuck on it

605
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
one piece of advice i have on on that is

606
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,919
is to try things out

607
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,919
something you know pull over an open

608
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
source project deploy it on a on a

609
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,080
sample project uh get a trial from a

610
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
vendor who who wants to sell you their

611
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
latest observability system

612
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
and and kick the tires try it

613
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
experiment with it uh do a red team and

614
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
see if it'll pick things up you know if

615
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
they say well we have advanced

616
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,320
ai for detecting anomalous access

617
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
patterns say great

618
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,320
let's set it up and we have a team

619
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
that's going to go generate some

620
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,200
anomalous access patterns let's see

621
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,679
where you can catch them

622
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
sometimes that works and sometimes it

623
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,520
doesn't uh i know of uh

624
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,000
i know of interesting cases of both

625
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
uh but it's a way to it's a way to

626
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
validate the claims

627
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,559
because there are a lot of claims

628
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,360
there's a lot of a lot of hype around

629
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
this right now

630
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,720
backing up a minute um i we talked a

631
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
little bit i mentioned sdks one of the

632
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
things that is kind of promising is that

633
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
there are there's a lot more support

634
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,600
these days in in sdks in platforms

635
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
for wiring up observability features

636
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,840
wiring up metrics collection

637
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,559
the days are passing finally where you

638
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,000
have to go and you have to add okay i'm

639
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,360
going to add this counter and i'm going

640
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
to expose it here and i'm going to log

641
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
it to this

642
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
take advantage of those with with

643
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
as you're building things

644
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
but this can't really bolt anything on

645
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,840
uh

646
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,679
a lot of this does not work for legacy

647
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
systems

648
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,440
we you know you have what you have

649
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
uh those systems have outputs some of

650
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
them you can inspect in situ uh some of

651
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,679
the uh capabilities that vm providers

652
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,000
for example are starting to create uh

653
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,919
and some of the kernel tracing

654
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,320
uh working in linux can be used to

655
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
inspect internal internal state of

656
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,960
legacy apps but uh

657
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
you you either luck out or you don't on

658
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,240
whether that ends up giving you useful

659
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
data

660
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
uh let's see how we're doing on time how

661
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
we're doing fine

662
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,559
so that's covering a bunch of security

663
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,240
aspects i mentioned privacy at the

664
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
beginning

665
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,280
these tools can also be used for privacy

666
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,360
use cases where you're more concerned

667
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,840
with data and credentials than you are

668
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,600
with with

669
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
attacks

670
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,120
you may be looking for okay someone's

671
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
compromised this data someone has stolen

672
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
a credential passing it around someone

673
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
like that

674
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
the better you unders but the better you

675
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,120
have marked your data and metadata and

676
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,799
machine machine readable format the

677
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
better these probes and observability

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
tools can leverage that to line things

679
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,400
up with other things going on in the

680
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
system

681
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
not all of the state is sort of run time

682
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
metrics

683
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
and a flip side of of allowing

684
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,919
developers to use these tools to you

685
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,080
know the the positive side is it's a

686
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
great debugging tool being able to see

687
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
how a big distributed system works and

688
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
and how the logic that they are trying

689
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,960
to implement uh is behaving

690
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,200
if you're exposing data that way be very

691
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,640
careful i mean some of this is basic

692
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,559
data hygiene

693
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,440
but

694
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
having the trace probes emit an

695
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
identifier that's opaque still lets you

696
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
trace it through the system without

697
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,879
without exposing underlying data

698
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,240
so

699
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
going back to the

700
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,320
essential piece of the approach

701
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,679
which is frame frame the problem as how

702
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,760
do i answer these questions

703
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,159
uh when you know when i need to find out

704
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,159
what's going on inside the system

705
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,840
uh rather than firing off an

706
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
investigation it does require you to

707
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
build systems and processes that can

708
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,960
answer questions and not just display

709
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
info so

710
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
logs and metrics

711
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
can come across as being very read-only

712
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
they're sort of reporting

713
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
adding queries to that

714
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,400
really turns that from

715
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
sort of a static record of what happened

716
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
into something that you can work with to

717
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,678
understand what's going on right now

718
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,240
and with that

719
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,960
take some questions if anybody has them

720
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
um

721
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
what do you see as the

722
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,200
next steps as it relates to

723
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
logging and monitoring alerting

724
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,360
integration

725
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
what do i see as the next steps

726
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,279
um

727
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,200
right now a lot of the observation

728
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
observability

729
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
products that are out there and projects

730
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,039
in the open source land are extending on

731
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
things that have been built already

732
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,159
building on things like prometheus and

733
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
grafana and time series metric storage

734
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
and trying to load

735
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
plot machine learning models on those

736
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
trying to plot more abstract models on

737
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,520
those i think that's a fairly limited

738
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
limited gain

739
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
i think that the next step is going to

740
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,760
be

741
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
there's going to be something that's

742
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,279
along the lines of going from logs to

743
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,200
storing things in time series

744
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
so that we can capture behavior so that

745
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,679
we can go find the next level of

746
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,039
abstraction i don't think anybody's

747
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,360
found that yet and so i'm very

748
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
interested in where people get

749
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,880
frustrated with the observability tools

750
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
that we built now that okay this still

751
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,559
doesn't answer my question i need a way

752
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,320
to answer x

753
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
and that's going to trigger the next

754
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,440
step of okay let's let's pivot our our

755
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,320
framing from

756
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,720
gathering logs and events and traces

757
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
what's the next thing past traces i

758
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,320
don't know what that is yet

759
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,919
but there's something and it's going to

760
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,080
be born out of frustration all of this

761
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,120
stuff

762
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
is a product of somebody getting very

763
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,919
frustrated they have a problem to solve

764
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,039
they can't find the information they're

765
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,880
looking for

766
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
they they want to be able to ask a

767
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,559
computer and get an answer rather than

768
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,000
tracking down a human and saying okay

769
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,159
what what what does this mean

770
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,440
um

771
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,279
so i wish i had a clear view of what was

772
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,760
next there i think that's an area of

773
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
active experimentation

774
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,240
across the industry so i'm looking

775
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,279
forward to finding out what that

776
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,840
like is can we improve in like

777
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,399
viewing the not investigations of the

778
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,840
query like

779
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
have you done anything around like how

780
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,039
that would be in a process

781
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,840
so the question was

782
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,039
uh how do you

783
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,120
we structure the query process so that

784
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,559
we can get better answers out of the

785
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,879
data

786
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,960
there are a couple different ways to do

787
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
that uh i know that uh

788
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,640
there have been some applications of

789
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,960
large database uh

790
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,559
technology so dumping things into

791
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,720
something like uh

792
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,520
google bigquery or another sort of large

793
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
database that can do

794
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
very rapid queries around huge amounts

795
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
of data one example of that that relates

796
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,200
to observability uh is deps.dev

797
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
which is an experiment being run by

798
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,520
google where every every day we crawl

799
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
all the major open source

800
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,520
repositories and grab all of the

801
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,919
dependency data and put that into a

802
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,840
database you can query so that if you

803
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
want to

804
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
issue queries against okay has the

805
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
dependencies for this package changed

806
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
has such and such happen you can issue a

807
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,279
query against that instead of having to

808
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,399
go crawl it or inspect it yourself uh i

809
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,760
think there's going to likely to be more

810
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
of that as we identify

811
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
what corpuses of data

812
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,840
are useful

813
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,679
across organizations to query the open

814
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,880
source dependencies was kind of an

815
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,559
obvious target for that

816
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
it's a question many people have

817
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,039
especially after log4j

818
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,120
uh and people worrying about the next

819
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
long 4-day things like that

820
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,880
so those technologies have some

821
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,600
applicability uh they're a little manual

822
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,880
now you know

823
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,760
you you to use them right now you you

824
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
exit your

825
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
your observability environment you go

826
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,919
start typing sql queries at something or

827
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,799
have a wrap a ui around that

828
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,039
um i think the success of those will

829
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,760
start to

830
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,480
push towards more purpose-built tools

831
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,320
people have been logging stuff into sql

832
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
and issuing queries about it forever but

833
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,080
the time series database was a was

834
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
definitely a step up from that i think

835
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,039
we could see similar stuff for other

836
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,799
kinds of signals

837
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,760
i don't know if that answers your

838
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,720
question okay

839
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,559
yeah

840
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,340
um

841
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,760
[Laughter]

842
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:52,269
[Music]

843
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,840
is

844
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,279
okay so trying to repeat the question

845
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,399
for the stream

846
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,679
uh

847
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,120
question is i've talked a bunch about

848
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
having one unified source of truth for a

849
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
bunch of teams to be able to query but

850
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,240
it seems like we have more and more of

851
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
those as time goes on more and more

852
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,000
sources of data more and more things we

853
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
have to uh we have to consult

854
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,360
why is that

855
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,120
and i think the answer to that is that

856
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,159
we don't have

857
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,840
we don't have that good

858
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
unified source of truth and we may never

859
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
you know

860
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,240
teams

861
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
solve problems and build tools around

862
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
the problems they're facing

863
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
sometimes having one grand unified

864
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
platform is not

865
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,519
does not actually make life easier those

866
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,760
of us who work for big enterprises

867
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,399
doing it doing it the one true way

868
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,080
can often be harder than just rolling

869
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
something yourself

870
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,000
i do think that as the analysis tools

871
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
get better

872
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,799
and

873
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,640
they allow you to to answer questions

874
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,880
about the data you are gathering

875
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,120
um that provides some incentives for

876
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
federation for

877
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,960
other kinds of

878
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
taking all those multiple sources not

879
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
necessarily all dumping them into the

880
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,559
same store but being able to query

881
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,919
across them

882
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,399
and correlate things across them so that

883
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,240
if you have something that's generating

884
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,519
timelines

885
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,799
and you have something else that's

886
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,919
measuring production traffic being able

887
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,000
to do that kind of join

888
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,760
i think is going to be

889
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
uh

890
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
be the way to handle that kind of

891
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,360
scaling multiple sources so big joins

892
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,200
across multiple data sources is its own

893
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,080
research topic indeed in database land

894
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,120
but i think that that's likely to be the

895
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,799
most fruitful approach to that i don't

896
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,320
think we're going to

897
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,440
uh

898
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720
we're i don't think we're ever going to

899
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,559
get to one single source of truth for

900
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,360
data just like i don't think that

901
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,559
all uh

902
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,000
you know understanding everything going

903
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,240
on in in in a system is ever going to be

904
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,039
one that one seamless pane of glass

905
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,799
but where we can reduce fragmentation

906
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,320
the better and where we can move

907
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,240
information from one context to another

908
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
without having a human having to copy

909
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
and paste it or type in

910
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,399
type in a query get an id right things

911
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
like that that kind of interoperability

912
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,840
i think is going to be what's going to

913
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,399
make the biggest difference

914
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,919
going once

915
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,279
all right one more question

916
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,919
is

917
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,960
um

918
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,840
so uh to repeat summarize the question

919
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,600
uh what happens when something that's

920
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,039
gathering data so you know a

921
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,039
traceability probe an observability

922
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,720
probe of some sort has been compromised

923
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
so something is feeding grad data into

924
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,559
your big central store

925
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
that's that's the same problem that uh

926
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,240
we face all the time how do we how do we

927
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
detect that something is anomalous

928
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,880
that does touch on the watchers who

929
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
watches the watchers question i had

930
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,760
there are levels

931
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
levels to this that we have to think

932
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,399
about you know how do we know that the

933
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
data we're asking questions over is

934
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,879
accurate

935
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,960
how do we audit end points

936
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
how do we understand if an endpoint is

937
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
under an attacker's control

938
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
or someone is misusing the data that

939
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,119
we're gathering

940
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,639
i don't think there's anything special

941
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
about that when it comes to

942
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,760
observability you know it's the same

943
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,679
problem we have with endpoint management

944
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,960
in general

945
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
with any kind of

946
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,199
remote sensor

947
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,879
you can look at the data under your and

948
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,719
and the traffic under your control you

949
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,159
can look at what that remote sensor is

950
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,639
telling you and if they don't match

951
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,239
that's something to flag you know that

952
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,359
and that is something you want to be

953
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,399
able to see

954
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,679
so you know

955
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,159
being able to detect that on your end of

956
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,879
it is is a good place to put some kind

957
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,680
of sensor some kind of probe and feed

958
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,599
into your observability system like are

959
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,000
we suddenly seeing a bunch of flaky

960
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,240
phone handsets or

961
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,880
unusual activity for lack of usual

962
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
activity from

963
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
laptops or remote systems that are

964
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,920
outside of our security boundary things

965
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
like that

966
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
so

967
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,160
being able to answer those kinds of

968
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,400
questions is itself an observability

969
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,320
that uh use case

970
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,040
uh

971
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
picking but it does highlight the

972
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
performance of pic the importance of

973
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,440
picking what it is you're gonna monitor

974
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,839
you know

975
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,800
you'd you do need to just not

976
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
you can't necessarily deduce all of

977
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,400
these things from data you think of in

978
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
advance and so when something comes up

979
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,760
learn learn from every incident okay we

980
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,839
should be we should be reporting this we

981
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
should be

982
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,359
gathering this data in addition to this

983
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,359
sensor we've already got deployed so

984
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,119
that we can detect when when these kinds

985
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,520
of inconsistencies happen

986
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,280
and you know like any

987
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,200
any kind of automation it's easier to

988
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
automate cases that you've already

989
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,359
experienced rather than to anticipate

990
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,440
well what could go wrong in the future

991
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,240
that that is a lot of all of our jobs

992
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,760
that's something no one has figured out

993
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,760
automated

994
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,160
all right well i took less time than i

995
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
expected

996
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,920
sorry if i was talking fast

997
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,640
uh any last-minute questions otherwise

998
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,680
give everybody a bit of a break
