00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
the radio they do these time stamps so

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
defense in general

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
so i want to tell you

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
a little bit of sort of who i am why i'm

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,679
interested in cyber security i started

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
my career

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,239
in

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,160
cyber security back when al gore

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,720
invented the internet i was in graduate

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
school at purdue in the early 80s and

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
the undergraduates went away

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
i think it was in 1982 the

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
undergraduates went away in the summer

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
and when they came back

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
all of us graduate students had been

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
playing with the 3270 terminals that had

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,959
appeared sprouted up all around campus

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
and we ran we read thousands of man

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
thousand pages of man pages and learned

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,720
how to use unix so that's how long i've

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,319
been around um

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,560
computers i i only use it as a tool i

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,640
wasn't in cyber security back then

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
because the the kind of cyber security

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
we practiced was making sure to lock

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,920
your terminal before you went to the

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
bathroom because somebody was going to

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
come back and put

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
horrible ascii art in your dot profile

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
so next time you logged on it would

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
there would be i mean for as obscene as

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,239
ascii art can be that that would be on

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,840
your your terminal

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,159
um so i got my i got my graduate degree

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,680
i started working in industry for a

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
company called syntax you probably

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
haven't heard of it but you've heard of

92
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,560
the sexual revolution they were the

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
first

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
market of oral contraceptives and some

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
of you may know

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
a company that is now at their home

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,760
address anybody know who is at 3401 hill

98
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,799
view avenue in palo alto

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,680
it's now the home address of vmware

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
so syntax doesn't live there anymore

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
vmware is there and xerox palo alto

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,599
research center is right across the

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
street so it was an amazing time to be

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,239
learning about computers

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
but syntax is no more i was a

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
pharmaceutical scientist for about 20

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
years i worked for pfizer some of you

108
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
have probably heard of pfizer they've

109
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,040
been in the news in the past couple of

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
years

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
so i lived in kalamazoo michigan that's

112
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
where there's a there's a vaccine plant

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
in kalamazoo

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
so i worked for them for 20 years i saw

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
the value in the dark side and i went

116
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
over to it

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
i participated in a

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,159
project to take away admin privileges

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
from 18 000 r d

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
employees of pfizer globally

121
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
and you might notice i don't work for

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
pfizer anymore

123
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,599
uh that's not why

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
but so i was i was very interested in

125
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
cyber security as i got as i tried to

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
say started taking sans courses when i

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
assisted my employer with our downsizing

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
activities we had a retraining allowance

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,240
and i fell in with a group of people at

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
sands

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
and started doing facilitation i got a

132
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,120
bunch of certifications that sort of

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
thing i even got hired at sands helped

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
him spin up a master's degree so i

135
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,960
i was around security for for sort of a

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,000
long time and it was exciting but you

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,960
know these days things are changing

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639
and we have covid we have ransomware

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,680
we have

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
all kinds of other uncertainty and this

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,440
really is my

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
my motto these days

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
i am a dancer or i started dancing again

144
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
um

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,919
the love like you've never been hurt you

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,520
know if if you've never been hurt in

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
love you know bless your heart but um

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,479
the credits up there

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,320
i i don't like to use uh pictures

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
without credit so poetic boredom i think

151
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,919
is is where i got that and i think the

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
the soundtrack should be life during

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
wartime burned all my notebooks

154
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
right

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
so things are kind of depressing i mean

156
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
you heard the thank you for for joining

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
us back in

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
back here in person it's been a very

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,199
long time i went to shmukan

160
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
in march and it was really weird because

161
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
everybody has masks on and you know you

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
see the same people every year but i'm

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
not used to looking at their eyes

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
and bless i you all have beautiful eyes

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
and and i remember you but you know it's

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
really difficult to know who to give a

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
big hug to so just give big hugs to

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
everybody okay

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
that actually is uh pretty good advice

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
so what do we how do we

171
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
knowing that everything is going to hell

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
in a handbasket what are we going to do

173
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
and my my person one of my personal

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
heroes is mr rogers i think mr rogers is

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
a badass

176
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
mr rogers

177
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
figured out there was a need to be met

178
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
and he petitioned a large organization

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
to make a change in their policy

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,039
so that he could build a team to address

181
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
that need some of you know the story his

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,479
thing was children and uh he thought

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
that tv was the way to to minister to

184
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
children or communicate with them but he

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
established a program to help children

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
uh specifically and he had to get a

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
large organization the presbyterian

188
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
church of the united states to to change

189
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
their policies not i don't want to talk

190
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,639
about religion or anything like that but

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,240
the fact is you know he's a pretty

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
badass guy for being mr rogers i think

193
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,319
the the thing that we do in the mic-3

194
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
the michigan cyber civilian court is we

195
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,199
help the helpers

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,240
we

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
interoperate with the national guard law

198
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
enforcement other people

199
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
cyber defenders

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
we also do some training we train the

201
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
trade trainers and the the bottom line

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
message here

203
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
something that i have learned in the

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
past couple of years or you know i knew

205
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,759
this

206
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,680
but it's been brought home is that

207
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
feelings drive behavior i would love to

208
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
think that i have a phd in engineering

209
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,120
okay

210
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,440
i i think about things very logically

211
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,599
i'm sure all of us in this room think we

212
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,680
do but the fact is that feelings drive

213
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,599
behavior we're not as rational as we

214
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,080
think so we have to we do still have to

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,319
use rational facts all that sort of

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
thing but remember as we approach people

217
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
the feelings matter a lot

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
so

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,800
there's a problem

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
we look around in michigan

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
who needs help

222
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
if we're going to help

223
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,479
public entities

224
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,800
how big is the problem in michigan we

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,680
have

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
2500 plus public entities

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,000
and i have been told that about 500 of

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,759
them have a contract within with an msp

229
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,520
so that leaves 2 000

230
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
entities that are all on their own

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,879
these are counties

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,840
cities so any municipal division of

233
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
government plus we have school districts

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,759
and we have other

235
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,400
districts that have technology in them

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
so we'll have an intermediate school

237
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,080
district or an educational district

238
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
where you have a group of people that

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,839
are responsible for uh supporting the

240
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,799
technology it's also true that sometimes

241
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,479
like an intermediate school district the

242
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
boundaries will overlap that of a county

243
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
so trying to organize a response in a

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
situation like that is a real challenge

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,959
so we have 2500 plus public entities and

246
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
a lot of overlap

247
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
we have done and i think this is more

248
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
than many states have done we recently

249
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,760
did a multi-agency statewide exercise to

250
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,640
test the response of all of the agencies

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
in the state

252
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,120
to see how well we would do and does

253
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
anybody want to venture a guess at how

254
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,560
well we did

255
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
anybody ever seen the keystone cops

256
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
like i was not in the in the emergency

257
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
ops center but you could tell there were

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
people that

259
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
probably had some notebooks on their on

260
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,920
their uh

261
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,120
on their shelf

262
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
and they were pulling them down and

263
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
opening them for the first time in a

264
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
very long time

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,959
so we had the way that worked was we had

266
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,360
our state emergency op center folks

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
working and we we had had some personal

268
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
change personnel changes in the upper

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,880
management uh level uh but as we got the

270
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,360
third entity affected you could just see

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
things falling apart and i

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
i would say don't tell anybody but you

273
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
know

274
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
if there's an estate around in the

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
united states that that wouldn't happen

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
to i i'll be surprised i mean this is

277
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
just normal kind of stuff so we're

278
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
trying to figure out how to prioritize

279
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
where to put our energies

280
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
and how to organize helping people who

281
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
are who are in trouble

282
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
we talk one of the themes that's been

283
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
talked about here is the cyberpoor and

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
this is a a list not of all michigan

285
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,839
counties because i can't find them all

286
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,600
in in this list

287
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
but if you look along there this is the

288
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
the shape of that curve is fairly

289
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,360
typical we have i think ten counties

290
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
that are over a hundred thousand and

291
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
then it drops off very precipitously you

292
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,440
see my my county kalamazoo county is

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
number five we have a couple hundred

294
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
thousand people

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,800
um

296
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,600
so

297
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
there are some folks

298
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,279
wayne wayne county on the far left

299
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
that's detroit so you can see this is

300
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
detroit flint kalamazoo lansing are the

301
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
other ones those are those are the folks

302
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
that you know they have a full i.t staff

303
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,399
but

304
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
the folks you get out past about the

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,079
10th one

306
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
they may have one person and if you get

307
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,920
way far out to the right and some of you

308
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,880
know the geography of michigan we have

309
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
you know we have one hand here and then

310
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,279
we have this one and up here

311
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,079
that's the upper peninsula and we we all

312
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,519
make

313
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,200
fun jokes about our our yupers that live

314
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,279
up there but there's not a lot of people

315
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,240
there's way more mosquitoes than people

316
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
and so finding cyber health up there is

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
really difficult we have

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,000
as an example in the mic-3 we are fairly

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,040
typical

320
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
typically distributed like the normal

321
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
population we have three members in the

322
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
in the u.p in the upper peninsula

323
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
so we really do have some folks that

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
need help often you'll you'll have the

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
you know the i.t person there if they

326
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
have one is the kid that was really good

327
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,200
in the math class in high school right

328
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,240
and that's

329
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,040
like

330
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
i

331
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,839
i say that fondly you know because bless

332
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:02,880
their hearts

333
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
they got to change passwords they got to

334
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
make sure that everything works and at

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
the same time think about being secure

336
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
it's not going to happen so we had

337
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
exceptionally uh

338
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
technically oriented government

339
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
officials for a while and they came up

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
with an idea to to utilize the cyber

341
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,360
defense resources that we had in

342
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
michigan because

343
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
back when the michigan cyber civilian

344
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
corps was organized around 2010 2012

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
the in the main industry in michigan

346
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
well i just asked if you think of

347
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
michigan you probably don't think of

348
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,720
computers

349
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
you think of the auto industry probably

350
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
and the auto industry has had its ups

351
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,839
and downs and so when rick snyder whose

352
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
twitter handle by the way is one tough

353
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,839
nerd so he thinks of himself as a techie

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
guy

355
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
governor snyder

356
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
works with our chief technology officer

357
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,519
our chief information officer who and i

358
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,600
get them mixed up i think cio is dan

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,079
lorman who now writes for in from

360
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,800
infosec magazine i think he's a he

361
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
writes some pretty good stuff um

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
david bien was the cto he now works for

363
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
lazy boy i believe so we had we had a

364
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
cadre of

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
high level government officials who

366
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,040
thought this would be a good idea to

367
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,000
organize a cyber defense

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
group so they created it in 2013 i

369
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
actually found the youtube video where

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
he announced this at we used to have the

371
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
governor's cyber summit it was the north

372
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
american international cyber security

373
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,519
summit it was held in detroit it was

374
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,720
international because you could see

375
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,440
canada across the it wasn't like seeing

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
russia from alaska but we could at least

377
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,800
see canada

378
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
so they he announced that we would have

379
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,639
we would form this this group of

380
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,920
volunteers

381
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,199
and it was in collaboration with

382
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
something called the merit networks

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,720
merit is a non-profit in the united

384
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
states they were one of the first

385
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,959
uh participants in

386
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,079
creating

387
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,519
the internet and distributing the

388
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
internet across the united states and

389
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
i'm pretty sure when i went to purdue in

390
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,760
graduate school merit was providing our

391
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
our internet service i don't know that

392
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
for sure but they've been around for

393
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,399
forever

394
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
and they had they had hired a guy named

395
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
joe adams from the national defense

396
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
university to come to michigan move back

397
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,920
to michigan and start their cyber range

398
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,440
and this you know there are people that

399
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,680
have cyber ranges these days and the

400
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,000
idea is to use the cyber range cyber

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
ranges for training people so they had

402
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
the idea that they would take the the

403
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,079
cyber defense

404
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,079
level of expertise that we have in

405
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
michigan and use the cyber range to

406
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
provide training to those folks and then

407
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
they'd be able to use those those people

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
to respond in the event of a governor

409
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
declared cyber emergency governor

410
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,839
declared cyber emergency in michigan we

411
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,519
have a cyber

412
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
cyber disruption response plan that

413
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,639
lists five levels of activation the last

414
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,800
level is when the governor declares a

415
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,199
state of of cyber emergency and the

416
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,360
conditions for that are that life and

417
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,399
limb are at stake like people might die

418
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
and around this time we're talking about

419
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
2013

420
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,560
it took them actually a few years to get

421
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
that started so i don't know if you

422
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
remember around 2007 i think the

423
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
department of energy got an electron an

424
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
electric

425
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
generator

426
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,360
took it to idaho and blew it up

427
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
using using packets

428
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
and that caused a lot of uh

429
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,920
consternation got a lot of publicity

430
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
and people it was not that long i don't

431
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,000
remember which happened first but there

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,320
was this the squirrel that took out the

433
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,639
northeastern seaboard so we knew about

434
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,040
the uh the fragility of the electrical

435
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
grid so the idea was the the fear

436
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,839
that we articulated as members was okay

437
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,399
so a nation state takes out two power

438
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
plants in the upper peninsula that's

439
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,000
that's the one up here where it gets

440
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
really cold

441
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,279
and people are going to die

442
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
okay cool

443
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
we are the michigan cyber civilian corps

444
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,839
we're going to respond to this now

445
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
imagine

446
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,800
so you're

447
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,279
you're a normal cyber defense person and

448
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
you get a call that a power plant has

449
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
gone down and you have to go help

450
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,440
like what are you gonna do

451
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,639
i it's

452
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
you know i don't know this for sure we

453
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
never really went through a tabletop

454
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
exercise on this but it seemed to me

455
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
that the what we would mostly be doing

456
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
would be handing out water bottles and

457
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,839
you know making sure medical care got to

458
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,120
where it needed to be and that sort of

459
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,480
thing wouldn't do

460
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
the thing you really need at that point

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,639
is not people looking at packets and

462
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,600
anyway

463
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,639
you're probably not going to have a

464
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
bunch of people you've never seen before

465
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,000
come look on your network

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
as a member of the the mic 3 i

467
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,720
i joined in 2015

468
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
i think 2014 2015 was after i left sans

469
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,759
they got accreditation for their

470
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
master's degree and they didn't need

471
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
as many people as they had and so i

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
assisted them with their downsizing

473
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
activities and volunteered to work for

474
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,400
this group

475
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
we were the members were fairly

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
frustrated because we didn't know what

477
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
what we were supposed to be doing

478
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,959
and we agitated

479
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
we got really lucky one of our members

480
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,119
got seconded to the state to be the

481
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,119
chief information security officer and

482
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
he got a budget

483
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
so the next year we had sans training

484
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
so if you want a hint on how you can

485
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,119
make this happen it's offer something

486
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,400
valuable

487
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
and somehow

488
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
that rfp never got out of the

489
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
procurement system i have no idea how

490
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,840
procurement works at the state but

491
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,919
somebody did something we got some sands

492
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
training

493
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
so in 2015

494
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
we negotiated with merritt to take over

495
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
responsibility because

496
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,799
the original vision we had people

497
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
already in the core that were more

498
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,720
qualified than the training that mayor

499
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
was offering they were doing sort of

500
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
beginner security which is

501
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
totally great very happy that they are

502
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
doing it but for our members it didn't

503
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,039
didn't work

504
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,360
so the state assumed responsibility we

505
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,160
gave

506
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,760
for those of you that are familiar with

507
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
sans training we did security 504 which

508
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
is sort of the entry level

509
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
ethical hacking course it also teaches

510
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,679
you an incident response

511
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,720
framework

512
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
they use prevent identify contain

513
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,960
eradicate pickerel

514
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
restore and lessons learned i know this

515
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
has a has different words but it's the

516
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,360
same same thing

517
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
so um

518
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,559
so we gave 504 the next year we did

519
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,039
monitoring network monitoring which we

520
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,400
figured would teach people how to

521
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,559
understand what a normal network looks

522
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
like the year after that we did network

523
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
forensics because i this is personal

524
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,960
prejudice

525
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
we have members that would love to do

526
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
memory forensics we'd love to go take a

527
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,720
disc image and see what the malware

528
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,919
looks like but in terms of our job is to

529
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
get public services back online

530
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
when a local government goes down

531
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
people may not be able to get their

532
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
child support checks they may not be

533
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
able to file their marriage certificates

534
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
they can't they sell their house they

535
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,760
can't file the title that sort of thing

536
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,080
you know this is what we're trying to

537
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
i um i don't want to say i don't care

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
what the malware looks like but i want

539
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,240
to get people back that i want to get

540
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,080
people back online so that they can live

541
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,039
their lives so um so we did network

542
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,280
forensics which is the way that you can

543
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
determine where the infection is and get

544
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
rid of it not so much about endpoint

545
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
forensics though i do have some members

546
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
that would like to do that and um

547
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
wisconsin has a program that i'm hoping

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
we can collaborate with and help some of

549
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,400
our members get trained talk about that

550
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
more

551
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,039
in 2017

552
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,679
the cso the state of michigan was a guy

553
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,280
named christa russia

554
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,240
chris is now the federal cso is in the

555
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
white house

556
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
and he had come from the the white house

557
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
of the 44th president so he had some

558
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
contacts in the federal government to

559
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
get some language

560
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
around legislation and in 2017 we got

561
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
legislation passed called the michigan

562
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,480
cyber civilian act

563
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,159
and you should look it up if you're if

564
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,440
you're interested in doing something

565
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
like this you should look it up i never

566
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,880
thought i would be thankful to

567
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
legislators but they wrote it in a in a

568
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,840
very flexible way

569
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,520
we have to have

570
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,679
we have to have technical standards for

571
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,520
our members we have to have them

572
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
background checked but that's pretty

573
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
much and we have to have an advisory

574
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,440
board that sets our processes and of

575
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,039
course we have to follow the processes

576
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,360
that our advisory board sets but our

577
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,799
advisory board is people that are

578
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
friendly to us and i

579
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,159
i don't want to give anybody an

580
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,960
impression that we're trying to

581
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,760
manipulate anything but it is it is

582
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
it is just a really crafted piece of

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,919
legislation and to support that i will

584
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
say that texas stole or

585
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
borrowed copy pasted some of our

586
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
language they have a group called a

587
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
volunteer incident response team

588
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,240
and they used some of the language in

589
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
their legislation that created that so

590
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
it's pretty good legislation

591
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,280
it was amended in 2019 so if you look at

592
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
it online you'll see two dates there's a

593
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,320
2018 effective date 2020 effective date

594
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
the original legislation required that

595
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,000
we do federal background checks

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,640
including fbi criminal background checks

597
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
and just as a heads up an fbi criminal

598
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
background check will

599
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
flag youthful offender stuff so if you

600
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,120
were 13

601
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
and you pled guilty because

602
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,120
and were

603
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
assured that

604
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
the record would be expunged expunged

605
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,760
doesn't mean it goes away for forever so

606
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
we have it the way our situation works

607
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
we have the state police review whatever

608
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
comes up and they get to say

609
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
whether somebody passes their background

610
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
check or not i don't know

611
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
what would flag somebody fail in their

612
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
background check and i don't want to

613
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
know because i don't you know i don't

614
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
want to have that conversation but it

615
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,240
happens

616
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,039
that

617
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
when the legislation when the first

618
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,600
legislation got signed you know when the

619
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,559
the chief executive signs a bill

620
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,400
they like to have a photo op

621
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,159
so we wanted to have some of our members

622
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
come sit behind governor snyder while he

623
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
signed the the legislation and it was it

624
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
was short notice and the only person we

625
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,799
could get was one guy who had been with

626
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
the organization since merit so he was

627
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,799
there and there were a bunch of

628
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,360
secretaries if you look at the photo op

629
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
it's not really people at the mic-3

630
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
don't tell anybody

631
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
so we had one member there

632
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,039
and you can see what's coming this is a

633
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
member who when he was young was

634
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
involved in something he keeps trying to

635
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
tell me about it i don't want to know

636
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
but

637
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,679
he

638
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,720
got

639
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
he couldn't be a member

640
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,280
so

641
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,799
it's the the thing that happened in 2019

642
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,600
is brett's amendment so brett can now be

643
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
an advisor he can't go out and type in

644
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,559
the keyboard but he can give advice he

645
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,480
can know things so i'm very proud that

646
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
we were able to make that happen for him

647
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,760
and you know we try and take care of our

648
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
members i talked to my i talked to our

649
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
members for about an hour a couple of

650
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,919
times a year i make a point to to do

651
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
that to help understand their needs

652
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,080
so

653
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
we we went through all the uh the

654
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,679
logistics to make that happen the

655
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,480
benefits we are now the mic-3 is now

656
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
included officially in the state cyber

657
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,039
response plan and exercises of the plan

658
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
that multi-agency

659
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
tabletop i was a participant we didn't

660
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,440
have members participate because we kind

661
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,720
of knew we wouldn't be doing much

662
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
response but we're officially

663
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,000
included now the members receive regular

664
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
training and professional development i

665
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
sometimes say that the reason you want

666
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
to form a community like this is so that

667
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,039
you'll have somebody to laugh at your

668
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,080
jokes

669
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,799
you know if you like who else are you

670
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,919
gonna tell

671
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
that you got a udp joke but they might

672
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,080
not get it right

673
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
people in this room about yeah okay

674
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
maybe we won't tell that one again

675
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,720
but

676
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,960
it i mean like i said feeling stride

677
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,880
behavior and if you can make people feel

678
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,159
comfortable they know they can pick up

679
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,880
the phone and and talk to somebody and

680
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
check something out it makes them feel a

681
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
lot more comfortable

682
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,080
we also have had i told you i talked to

683
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
my members

684
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
over 80 percent of my members have

685
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
changed jobs in the past year

686
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
and a lot of that is because they know

687
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
people right they get they get a clue

688
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,480
about a job that's getting being posted

689
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
we're trying to get involved in k-12 it

690
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,559
is more difficult to corrupt the youth

691
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,279
than it should be but i'm working on it

692
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,640
my my 12 year old neighbor is

693
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,320
watching my dog

694
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,400
this time and i left all my lock picking

695
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,360
stuff out and deviant's book and a link

696
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,200
to a

697
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,919
youtube video about picking locks so you

698
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,679
know we're trying to do this

699
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
uh we're also going to go out we have a

700
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
grant from dhs to

701
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
to work with a marketing company in

702
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
michigan to put together some stuff for

703
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
election security and i'm hoping some of

704
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,720
my members are going to be able to go

705
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,039
out and sit with clerks as they present

706
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
this information so basically to provide

707
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,000
a

708
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
some um

709
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,960
competence and

710
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
be another person to stand up like they

711
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,360
know something there's a fair amount of

712
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
value you can provide just by doing that

713
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,640
i think

714
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
so we have members have to have two

715
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
years of experience they have to have a

716
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,279
certificate

717
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,279
uh a certification and i'm not going to

718
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,679
argue about certifications okay i have i

719
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,240
have many so i know what they're worth

720
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,799
you don't have to convince me um we do

721
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,480
ask them to go to their employer to get

722
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
support for 10 days of participation

723
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
that counts training

724
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,159
and we're going to see how well that

725
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
works we have a face-to-face exercise

726
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,640
coming up on august 26th which is our

727
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
first face-to-face in a couple of years

728
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,720
so i'm hoping people will wake up

729
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
we use we have not done sans training in

730
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,320
a while we're using a company called

731
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
rangeforce which i like a lot

732
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,799
i'll be happy to talk to you i don't get

733
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,240
anything from them i don't get anything

734
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,279
from anybody i'm a public servant

735
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,200
the application process i'll go this

736
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
through this fairly quickly

737
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
the member applies at our website

738
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,240
you have to give us your name and

739
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
address and now you have to register

740
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,679
with a statewide identification system

741
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,240
which is called my login everything in

742
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,159
michigan starts with mi

743
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,400
because michigan and it's pronounced my

744
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,120
so

745
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
you may think in your state you have

746
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
stuff it's all my stuff

747
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
so you fill that you give us your name

748
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,679
address you get a my login um

749
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,039
and you you give us your personal

750
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,760
information no credit cards

751
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,799
then you take

752
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
tests do we have four tests which i'll

753
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
admit need to be changed they've

754
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
they haven't changed

755
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,320
um in too long

756
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,240
we have beginning and advanced incident

757
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,080
response and forensics there's an

758
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,679
initial test that's

759
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,159
pretty much ports and protocols

760
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,400
uh basic networking so if you pass that

761
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
one you get access to the basic ir and

762
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
basic forensics if you pass the basic

763
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
one of either of those you get access to

764
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,520
the advanced one okay five tests total

765
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,679
you have to pass four

766
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,720
and um i have i have enough history that

767
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
i know which one people are going to

768
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,400
fail we we know which questions are bad

769
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,279
i just don't have a test writer to

770
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
uh change the test i'd love to go to

771
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,480
something like maybe security plus and

772
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
have somebody else administer this but

773
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,159
we are where we are

774
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,159
i i should say

775
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,480
that the michigan cyber civilian corps

776
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,440
is at a point of minimum viable product

777
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
for those of you that are familiar with

778
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,960
entrepreneurial stuff it's it's good

779
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
enough to show people it's not perfect

780
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
totally got problems and you're welcome

781
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
to tell me what the problems are but

782
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,399
it's good enough to

783
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,159
to throw out there and let people get

784
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,520
ideas from it

785
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
so you have to pass four of the five

786
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
tests if you do that like i don't care

787
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,799
about your documentation if you can't

788
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,000
pass the test

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
with all due respect

790
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,279
if you pass the test then you send me a

791
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,200
resume you have to

792
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,039
fill out a volunteer agreement which

793
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,520
includes non-disclosure

794
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,480
um

795
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
the employer agreement which is not a

796
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
legally binding document it's a piece of

797
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
paper that you take into your manager

798
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,919
and say hey i want to do this the reason

799
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,919
it's not legally binding is well that

800
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,080
would be a pain but general motors is

801
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,320
look as as an example is located in

802
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,679
michigan and i have people i have

803
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
members that work for general motors

804
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,279
general motors legal counsel is never

805
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,760
going to let them their manager sign

806
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,039
a document like this so we just

807
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,399
blow it off

808
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,559
if if people don't show up for

809
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,320
activities for a period of time we can

810
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
declare them inactive and they won't get

811
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,799
access to training that sort of thing so

812
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
it's it's not a perfect solution but it

813
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
works

814
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
and once once we have all the mandatory

815
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,840
documentation then we do the background

816
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,600
check because we don't want to for

817
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,520
obvious reasons costs money

818
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
that kind of thing

819
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
when we operate this is how we operate

820
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,520
if somebody gets whacked they call the

821
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,720
state police

822
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,919
we are not um law enforcement so they

823
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,360
call the state police and the state

824
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,640
police vets the the call

825
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
maybe there's no criminal element

826
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,200
or maybe there is they they do the

827
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,039
evidence thing but law enforcement as

828
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,000
you know doesn't help people recover

829
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,919
so we have a very good work in relation

830
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,360
michigan has

831
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
i don't know all the other states

832
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,720
michigan has a really good cyber command

833
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,559
department

834
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
the guy that runs it lieutenant first

835
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,240
lieutenant jim ellis is always out of

836
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
town going to other states talking about

837
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,520
it i love working with these guys

838
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,559
because they're the ones that actually

839
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,039
do their memory forensics and they run

840
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,559
ida pro and things like that and they

841
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,720
will come to our meetings and talk to

842
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,480
our members occasionally so that to whet

843
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,000
their appetite

844
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,679
you know because we are going to do that

845
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,600
one day

846
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,840
so the the michigan cyber command center

847
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,880
vets uh that's the the incident if the

848
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,159
affected victim wants help

849
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,640
there are a series of legally legally

850
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,919
significant documents that go go by we

851
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,320
the person that the victim has to ask

852
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,039
for

853
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:11,919
help

854
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,559
we have to say yes we can provide help

855
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,559
if you are authorized to accept the help

856
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
reply in the affirmative and if they do

857
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
then they've said they're the one to you

858
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,720
know because we we need to have a throat

859
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,559
to choke at the at the victim

860
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,840
organization

861
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
um as it were

862
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,799
so that's how we operate i hope that i

863
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,640
have given you a lot of information that

864
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,399
will prompt questions because i'm going

865
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,640
to turn it over to to adrian in just a

866
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,600
second but the the bottom line this is

867
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
like when when kovitz started

868
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,159
everything shut down

869
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,480
and we had been doing cyber defense for

870
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,039
a long time and we couldn't do that like

871
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,440
we had done it and so a lot of us were

872
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
looking around for ways to be

873
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,320
to learn about serving the public

874
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,399
we in the executive branch of the state

875
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,799
of michigan we all took a 10 pay cut

876
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,799
temporarily well it was going to be

877
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,640
temporarily it hasn't come back yet but

878
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,799
you know i i'm not working for the

879
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,399
government to get rich

880
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,640
i went like i said i live in kalamazoo

881
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,399
michigan there's a pfizer plant there we

882
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,120
produce the vaccines and when the trucks

883
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,120
started rolling from the plant it was

884
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,880
people in kalamazoo we were like in

885
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
tears because

886
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,720
it's our family you know we can save we

887
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
can help save the world

888
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,600
so

889
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,679
after a while they started doing vaccine

890
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
clinics and the kalamazoo health

891
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
department called for volunteers

892
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
and this there's a lot of other stuff

893
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,519
going on and i needed to do something so

894
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
i volunteered to help with the

895
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,600
with giving people vaccines and i ended

896
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,519
up working as you see this is a the

897
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,360
front page the incident response plan

898
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,360
for for one week of doing uh vaccine uh

899
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
clinics so i ended up working like a ten

900
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
tenth of a year

901
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,320
for the health department but it was it

902
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,880
was hugely valuable i it is very

903
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,640
difficult for me to describe how it was

904
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,360
valuable but to go down there and stand

905
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
for three or four hours with regular

906
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
human beings who were coming in

907
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
afraid they were gonna die

908
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559
i mean this is cyber this is defense you

909
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,880
know it's not cyber defense but working

910
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
with people who were

911
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
really concerned about

912
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,120
the pretty bottom line you know it's an

913
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,799
existential issue

914
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,200
so this this is meeting people where

915
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,080
they are

916
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,480
i got to meet a lot of regular people i

917
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
also got some contacts with the local

918
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
emergency operations folks

919
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
kalamazoo has an international airport

920
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,679
the faa requires as you might expect

921
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,519
people to test their incident response

922
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,240
plan in an airport incident response is

923
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,159
a mass casualty event

924
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,039
so

925
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
during the course of this i also

926
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
participated with the the faa um

927
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,679
test of the kalamazoo battle creek

928
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,519
international airport there were like 50

929
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,559
of us

930
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,000
the people that got there early got to

931
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,240
get makeup and crawl up on top of the

932
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
school buses that they were using as the

933
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,279
airplane fuselage so

934
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
this gave i mean it was a lot of fun

935
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,919
certainly but it gave me an end with

936
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
another emergency operations group we

937
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:10,799
said

938
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,679
somebody said earlier that the reason

939
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,279
people are not careful is because they

940
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,600
don't think cyber is part of life

941
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
right well cyber is part of life and

942
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
life is part of cyber and the well you

943
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,559
know that sounds stupid right but but

944
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,519
still

945
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,519
there is tons of overlap we have to get

946
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,039
people thinking

947
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,679
um about it like brushing their teeth

948
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,200
right so so getting involved in this way

949
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120

you are looking for something to do

960
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,120
locally your state doesn't have a

961
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,159
program

962
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,640
and some states are a little slow there

963
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,000
are about a dozen states that are doing

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
programming like this but if you want to

965
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,679
do something and there's not something

966
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,280
in your state

967
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,399
you can

968
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,119

982
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
to you about a similar program that

983
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,159
we've launched about two years ago um

984
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,040
that's operating globally it's open to

985
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,599
to you i guess as well

986
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
called the cyber peace builders

987
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,359
program run by the cyber peace institute

988
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,359
which is where i walk and i'll tell you

989
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,800
more about these uh in a second

990
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,200
um but first i want to tell you a little

991
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,560
bit about the threats that

992
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
non-governmental organizations

993
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
in the last three years we've seen a

994
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,040
massive increase in the number of

995
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,079
attacks

996
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,839
against them in particular the attacks

997
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,800
being reported against them um we track

998
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,200
incidents against ngos as far back as 20

999
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,240
years ago

1000
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,200
and um ngos are unfortunately um

1001
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,000
quite an interesting target for both

1002
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
state actors and cyber criminals

1003
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,359
um

1004
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,680
a lot of people depend on on them around

1005
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,359
the world very critically the same way

1006
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,200
that you and me and ray depend on

1007
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,880
critical services offered by critical

1008
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
infrastructure operators right but if

1009
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,720
you think of emerging

1010
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
countries where the state is not

1011
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,800
necessarily protecting its citizens and

1012
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
the private sector is now really as

1013
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
active as it should be then you've got a

1014
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,119
lot of people that depend critically on

1015
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
on these services and actually if you go

1016
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,640
outside in the streets right here in

1017
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,240
vegas it took a walk yesterday night

1018
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,000
it's a lot of people on the streets that

1019
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,839
depend critically on ngos in developed

1020
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
economies as well

1021
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
um just a couple of incidents maybe you

1022
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,680
haven't heard of these roots of these

1023
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
actually ngo based um

1024
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,800
in the us that got money from usaid um

1025
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
and i was attacked by cyber criminals

1026
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,079
and we helped them investigate the the

1027
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599
incident they lost over a million

1028
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,440
funding that was destined to afghan

1029
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
farmers so that is money that was not

1030
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
provided to vulnerable a vulnerable

1031
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
community because some criminals thought

1032
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
it was a good idea to steal it we're not

1033
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,280
able to retrieve the money

1034
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,560
maybe you've heard of the international

1035
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,839
committee of the red cross that got

1036
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,839
hacked earlier this year half a million

1037
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,560
um refugees and all the

1038
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,119
people at risk that were whose personal

1039
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,240
data was was stolen and and potentially

1040
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,160
monetized

1041
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,240
and also just uh another attack that

1042
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,000
maybe you haven't heard of actually

1043
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,240
right here philadelphia ransomware

1044
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,640
attack over a million dollars that were

1045
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,119
um stolen and so i want you to compare

1046
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,720
that against what happened to colonial

1047
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,920
pipeline which i'm sure you've heard

1048
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,560
about um that led to at the end of the

1049
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,440
day um two million dollars being taken

1050
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,599
by the by criminals after the fbi

1051
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,160
recruit some of the other ransom

1052
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,400
um i want you to consider that

1053
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,680
actually for

1054
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,400
criminals um ngos

1055
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
still mean high payout right when you

1056
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
can make out with over a million dollars

1057
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,520
it's it's for criminals it's enough it's

1058
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
i don't want to say it's enough money i

1059
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
don't know what you know dependencies

1060
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,839
are about what their objectives are but

1061
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,680
but it's certainly comparable to some of

1062
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
the amount that they can steal from much

1063
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
more much more um

1064
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
protected targets

1065
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
in particular critical infrastructure in

1066
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
developed

1067
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
countries which

1068
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,040
enjoy some if not all of the benefits of

1069
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,720
the protections that can offer

1070
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,839
organizations like caesar or ansi were

1071
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,200
french cyber security agency where i

1072
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,599
used to walk um other such organizations

1073
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,839
right ngos do not enjoy any of the

1074
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,720
benefits of of these organizations

1075
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,040
and for for criminals

1076
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,800
they don't need to use complex zero days

1077
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,240
they don't need to burn their zero days

1078
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,079
on end use they can use a password that

1079
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,599
leaked 10 years ago

1080
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,359
which is what happened in some of the

1081
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,400
incidents that we've we've investigated

1082
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
and the big problem is that most of the

1083
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
ngos have started to operate their

1084
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,760
digital transformation only recently in

1085
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
the last decade more or less

1086
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,320
but they do not invest in cyber security

1087
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
right so they need help they need help

1088
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
now

1089
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,560
um

1090
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,640
that's why we created a volunteer led

1091
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
program called the cyber peace builders

1092
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,320
that basically takes cyber security

1093
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
professionals

1094
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
and presents them with

1095
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
a very short-term

1096
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,760
engagement opportunity so they can go

1097
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
and help

1098
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,560
ngos so it's literally as simple as this

1099
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
job board

1100
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,359
where you as a cyber security

1101
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,960
professional can connect you can see

1102
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
opportunities that we list we create

1103
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,480
relationship with ngos and then we

1104
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
create those missions there if i had

1105
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,160
internet i could actually show you but

1106
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,920
basically it's you can it's a canvas you

1107
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,599
can browse the opportunities on the left

1108
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,240
and see all right this ngo needs advice

1109
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,320
on 2fa it's going to take me one hour

1110
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
i'm have you know one hour my time next

1111
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
week next month or whatever let me say

1112
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,880
that i'm interested then we know that we

1113
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,560
match you up with the ngo and then you

1114
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
can deliver that help so remote help

1115
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,599
right it's short term um and like i

1116
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,599
guess what you guys did i am ic3 where

1117
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,200
it's a longer term engagement

1118
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,720
um obviously

1119
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,320
it falls outside its curve of incident

1120
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
response right because if an ngo is

1121
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,119
being ransomed they're not going to call

1122
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,520
you and to ask you to you know stop

1123
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,480
everything you're doing in the middle of

1124
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,119
the night so it's mostly pre and post

1125
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,000
incident um stuff right

1126
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,520
um

1127
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
just briefly we have over 70 ngos right

1128
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,040
now that are in our network most of them

1129
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
operate in the humanitarian context

1130
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,280
peace development things like that

1131
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,640
um we have over 200 um volunteer led

1132
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,880
missions in the platform after a little

1133
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,359
bit more than a year year of launch but

1134
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,960
that's that's just where we are today by

1135
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
the end of the year i want us to get to

1136
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,400
about 100 ngos by 2025 to a thousand

1137
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
ngos so we can get closer to that one

1138
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,240
billion people that all of these

1139
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,119
engineers support

1140
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,160
um

1141
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
just a couple of highlights in terms of

1142
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
missions maybe to make it more concrete

1143
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,160
uh for you guys and i'm happy to show

1144
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,839
you the ball after it's it's live you

1145
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,440
know on the internet so if you wanna

1146
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
pass by but just a couple of examples of

1147
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,839
what our volunteers did so

1148
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,680
one volunteer for instance spent well we

1149
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,839
had you know scoped it to four hours

1150
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,000
ended up spending 16 hours but not all

1151
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,359
jobs are like that most jobs are like

1152
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,200
one or two hours but doing a code review

1153
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,520
for an app developed by a mexican ngo to

1154
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
help um pregnant women in empower rich

1155
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,040
villages to tell them you know if you

1156
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,960
have this symptom that symptom this is

1157
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
what it means when they cannot consult

1158
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
doctors so they're looking to secure

1159
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
that code before launching it and so

1160
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,960
volunteers were able to do that um

1161
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,560
volunteer scan of websites of um fsd

1162
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,000
which is a foundational stream the

1163
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,839
diminished swiss demanding uh ngo um we

1164
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,599
had um

1165
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,160
um various one hour security assessments

1166
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,920
that basically help ngos understand

1167
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,920
where they're at so it gives them a

1168
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,000
one-page report with a three by three

1169
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,280
matrix uh with red you know orange and

1170
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,960
green tends to be red

1171
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
but it's really visual and helps them

1172
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,240
convince their leadership that their

1173
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,160
cyber security is not at the right level

1174
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,319
and they should invest you know in those

1175
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,520
basically nine pillars like

1176
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,680
authentication disaster recovery

1177
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,760
planning things like that

1178
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,960
um we supported an ngo implementing um

1179
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,760
pgp another one some of them come

1180
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,040
without requests like we were not

1181
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,200
expecting that but they came asking for

1182
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,640
insurance advice which is good you know

1183
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,280
in terms of maturity maybe not so great

1184
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,640
because maybe they're trying to just

1185
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,400
outsource all their risk

1186
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,599
but still you know they're asking

1187
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,280
themselves some interesting questions

1188
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,800
this is an example as well to tell you

1189
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,319
that our volunteers are not all

1190
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,319
technical folks so we have people that

1191
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,240
are yes forensic investigators that are

1192
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
incident responders that are you know

1193
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,760
people walking in in red teams and stuff

1194
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
but we also have people that are have a

1195
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
background in low background data

1196
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,240
protection even a background in

1197
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,680
communication like we have people who

1198
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
help ngos with their christ comes

1199
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
sometimes or maybe can even design a

1200
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,520
poster to raise awareness on two-factor

1201
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,760
authentication such things so it's not

1202
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
just technical advice

1203
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
um

1204
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,319
yeah we ran an ar um a wellness raising

1205
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,160
session in arabic so one of our

1206
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,359
volunteers

1207
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,040
that is actually um i don't know if he's

1208
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
here today but he's coming at

1209
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,319
defcon

1210
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,319
working for linkedin translated the

1211
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,680
presentation in arabic and delivered

1212
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
that to to an ngo

1213
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,760
and voila and that basically helped us

1214
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,560
to

1215
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,400
surface some of the most record needs

1216
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,040
that ngos have and temp templatize i

1217
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,920
think sign english uh the the jobs the

1218
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,319
missions so that other ngos that start

1219
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,520
you know from the bottom and really

1220
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,359
don't even know what to do couldn't have

1221
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,119
an idea in terms of all right maybe you

1222
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,720
know i can get a training for my stuff

1223
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,480
maybe i could do a pen test all right

1224
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,400
what is it pen tester let me let me do

1225
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,079
that with one of the volunteers etc so

1226
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,720
it helps them you know um advance in the

1227
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,880
journey and our hopes is to

1228
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
standardize that all the way up to

1229
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,200
trying to bring them to iso 27.1 and

1230
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
other you know nist frameworks for

1231
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,000
instance in the us or the frameworks in

1232
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
other parts of the world

1233
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,680
to to help them have a more structured

1234
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,960
approach

1235
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,880
just in terms of setting up that

1236
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,359
volunteer initiative um a couple of the

1237
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
you know the benefits and the incentives

1238
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,640
i think ray talked a little bit about

1239
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,240
that so let me do the same for the

1240
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,280
builders um what we try and do is foster

1241
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,359
you human-centric approach you talked

1242
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,960
about the importance of feelings and i

1243
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,240
talk about the importance of face to

1244
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,760
face you know seeing people and through

1245
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,200
the through the cypress builders you

1246
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,640
actually get to put a smile on people's

1247
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,560
faces you know no one helps these ngos

1248
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,760
so they're really happy when somebody

1249
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
comes and takes time and so it's really

1250
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,440
that human connection right seeing who

1251
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
you're helping

1252
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,560
having the ability for them to speak to

1253
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,240
someone rather than you know read a

1254
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
guideline or download the document or go

1255
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
to a conference but not engaged directly

1256
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,200
right having that personalized approach

1257
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,160
it's uh flexible for for the ngos as

1258
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,440
well because they can come up with

1259
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,720
whatever needs they have they can really

1260
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
ask us anything they want of course if

1261
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,520
you know it's internet response we'd say

1262
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,839
telescope if it takes you know 100 hours

1263
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,599
we tell them we cannot do that but but

1264
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,280
it's still flexible like they can ask

1265
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,040
what they what they want gives them

1266
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,200
access to industry great expertise right

1267
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,839
all of our volunteers have jobs right so

1268
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,000
they they they they come with that

1269
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
without experience

1270
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
big incentive right free of course

1271
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
um and back to some of the points you

1272
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,760
mentioned ray it's also the community

1273
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,160
approach allows cyber security staff or

1274
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,480
infosec staff and ngos to know each

1275
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,200
other and to start helping each other

1276
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,920
and building a sense of a cyber security

1277
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,520
committee within that within that

1278
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,040
humanitarian sector

1279
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,560
i dropped some of the

1280
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,319
some of the comments that folks have

1281
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,319
left in the surveys we do after every

1282
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,760
engagement

1283
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,599
in terms of volunteer incentives so if

1284
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,760
people you know like you who may want to

1285
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,240
join such a thing um of course you know

1286
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,440
it's a purpose-driven activity so

1287
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,720
it's something that sometimes you don't

1288
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
get to do in your day job and i think

1289
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
that most and i hope all of us in the

1290
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,400
cybersecurity industry have this kind of

1291
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,720
innate sense of helping of protecting

1292
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
and sometimes cyber security jobs can

1293
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,240
can you know stray a little bit away

1294
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,160
from that initial mission and so

1295
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,760
volunteering whether it's with a

1296
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,079
michigan uh with your state at the

1297
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,359
international level or through other

1298
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,119
initiatives right we're not the only one

1299
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,520
um it kind of appeals to that kind of

1300
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,000
sense of purpose that many of us have

1301
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:22,880
um

1302
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,560
it's beneficiary facing so you actually

1303
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,800
get to see the impact of what you what

1304
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,400
you do what you provide in terms of

1305
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,079
advice it's flexible as well right it

1306
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,440
adds to your schedule you don't have to

1307
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,960
do things when you cannot

1308
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,680
uh gives you mentoring opportunities or

1309
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,960
shadowing opportunities because you can

1310
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,319
partner up with other volunteers and

1311
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,720
learn from them learn their techniques

1312
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,119
uh it's a good way as well to upskill

1313
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,200
right we provide a training actually i

1314
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,640
think you have it here on the right

1315
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
where we give you some of the skills

1316
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,319
that you may need to

1317
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,760
enter into that kind of humanitarian

1318
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
context so what is international you

1319
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,720
know humanitarian

1320
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,000
action and humanitarian law um what is

1321
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,839
you know give you a sense of victimology

1322
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,680
and trauma communication a bit of

1323
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,960
diversity and inclusion in cyber

1324
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,480
security so it's a course that we made

1325
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,599
specifically for cyber security

1326
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,680
professionals but to introduce or

1327
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
develop some of the soft skills they may

1328
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,319
need for that

1329
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,240
that um volunteering opportunity

1330
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,359
basically

1331
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,200
and and yeah it's it's a good way to

1332
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,920
train us um train um more junior staff

1333
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,359
which is something that companies in

1334
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,599
general are interested in we walk a lot

1335
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,760
with companies so we try and do outreach

1336
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,520
directly at companies so we can get

1337
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,839
access to volunteers

1338
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,599
from their cybersecurity workforce which

1339
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,760
which helps with uh recruiting rather

1340
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,680
than you know going one by one we do

1341
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,839
both but uh but it helps for companies

1342
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,480
so in terms of incentives um it's

1343
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,520
obviously corporate social

1344
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,599
responsibility the pledge one percent

1345
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
and all the such movements take holarism

1346
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,640
etc uh it helps with talent retention

1347
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,160
back to the point i was making earlier

1348
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,720
on purpose right it helps because

1349
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,079
it helps align the values of the

1350
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,839
companies with that of the of the

1351
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,920
employees it helps train the junior

1352
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,280
staff right through shattering

1353
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
opportunities

1354
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,839
um it helps with soft skills

1355
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,440
developments as i mentioned obviously

1356
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,359
there's a visibility component

1357
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,800
associating um the company's um

1358
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,880
brand and you know name with that of the

1359
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
cyber peace

1360
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359
institute and there's because we we do

1361
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,119
random donations so if companies are

1362
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,560
willing to help there's also of course

1363
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,240
fiscal advantages

1364
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
um just a small thing that ray didn't

1365
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,880
talk about but i'm maybe some something

1366
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,559
to come up in the questions

1367
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,720
it costs to run these initiatives i have

1368
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,319
a full team that's that's behind me and

1369
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,000
there's actually a bigger institute so

1370
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,960
we're 30 people out of geneva um walking

1371
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,800
on three different pillars this is one

1372
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,040
of our three pillars right providing

1373
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,160
assistance um we then analyze all of the

1374
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,480
um information that we gather so that we

1375
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,640
are able to influence these issues go

1376
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
back to decision makers at united

1377
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,839
nations level in the different capitals

1378
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,280
around the world and tell them look this

1379
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,280
is how people are suffering online this

1380
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,920
is what we need to change right um

1381
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,599
but this is to say that there's a cost a

1382
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,280
cost to running all this

1383
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,880
and and it's not that simple i think

1384
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,319
there's more information online about

1385
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,559
you know what it costs for other states

1386
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,000
but it's roughly between half a million

1387
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,240
and a million us dollars i think a year

1388
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,040
to run these initiatives

1389
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,480
um

1390
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,599
yeah so

1391
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,280
very briefly if you if anyone is

1392
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,520
interested you come and talk to me um

1393
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,559
just to tell you that um if you would

1394
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,640
want to do something something like this

1395
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,240
and you'd want to do it with during your

1396
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,319
walking hours you're going to talk with

1397
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,839
your employer so we actually have an

1398
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,920
agreement with employers we do struggle

1399
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
with legal counsels but we have been

1400
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,000
able to get some to join

1401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,079
um and so once we get a corporate

1402
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,680
agreement sign it's much easier for us

1403
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,520
to be able to get employees

1404
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,240
um and then what we're finding out is

1405
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,680
that it takes time to go through legal

1406
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,400
counsel so we're also opening a route to

1407
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
um for volunteers who want to join

1408
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,079
without necessarily having a legal

1409
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,920
counsel you know involved in their whole

1410
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,400
company like uh signing off to this but

1411
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
we need we need to be able to do some

1412
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,480
kind of verification so we're leveraging

1413
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,280
background checks done by um

1414
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,720
organizations that provide security

1415
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,960
certifications like isa square so if you

1416
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,119
have such a certification and you went

1417
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,640
through such a background check then you

1418
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,880
know you can sign a standalone agreement

1419
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,400
send that to us and then we would be

1420
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,720
able to bring you in okay that's a new

1421
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,960
thing that we've started to do

1422
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,040
so that's it those are some of the

1423
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,680
organizations that we've been partnering

1424
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,640
with

1425
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,680
and

1426
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,200
stop here i have a bit of time for

1427
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,800
questions

1428
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,460
thank you thank you very much

1429
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,980
[Applause]

1430
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,040
any questions

1431
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,680
i i will confirm that that number

1432
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,839
that cost is about right half a million

1433
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
dollars we have

1434
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,960
you can do sans training for about if

1435
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,800
you if you work with them you can do a

1436
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,359
sans class for 65 people for about a

1437
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,800
quarter million

1438
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,920
um if you negotiate work with them

1439
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,839
i believe that i heard that the

1440
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,960
wisconsin um cyber their i forget what

1441
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,440
they call it their cyber team is has a

1442
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,359
budget of around half a million and

1443
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,680
maybe six hundred thousand ours is like

1444
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,920
four hundred thousand i think

1445
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,800
ish

1446
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
like i i shouldn't give away definite

1447
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,800
numbers but that's a reasonable number

1448
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,119
for michigan are you doing proactive

1449
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,240
engagements or only ir and second

1450
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,480
part of the question are you um

1451
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,960
in addition to assessing skills are you

1452
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,880
in any way determining

1453
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
the ethics of the people that you're

1454
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
engaging with

1455
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,359
so can can you repeat the first question

1456
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,040
or do it sure do you do proactive

1457
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,640
engagements where you help people like

1458
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,040
clean up things and do firewall audits

1459
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,280
and yeah we so the

1460
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,240
the way it happened in michigan was that

1461
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,319
when we perceived that there was a need

1462
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,200
they prioritized the response part

1463
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,280
as we started doing response we

1464
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,680
obviously knew that you know we will get

1465
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,040
overwhelmed if we have to do a lot of

1466
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,960
this we have to do proactive things

1467
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,720
there is now a program

1468
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,480
there used to be a program called cso as

1469
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,280
a service in michigan it ran for about a

1470
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,400
year and and stopped they resurrected

1471
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,319
that and expanded it to a program called

1472
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,760
cyber partners

1473
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
which is a community of

1474
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,440
a lot of the people that work for the

1475
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,920
state and do cyber and it's similar to

1476
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,319
the mic-3 only it is more proactive

1477
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,839
we've got agreements with people to do

1478
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,000
assessments cisa assessments and that

1479
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,240
sort of thing so the the reactive

1480
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,920
component spawned at the proactive

1481
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,839
component and yes we are doing that

1482
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,559
um but thank you both um if you're free

1483
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,640
we'd love for the two of you to join our

1484
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,800
brainstorming session which is moving

1485
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,160
it's one hour from now it's moving

1486
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,559
upstairs to the higher ground track

1487
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,440
but we one of the

1488
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,520
open-ended questions is as the cavalry

1489
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,400
expands and evolves its mission

1490
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,920
should we go down and across to the

1491
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,319
state or even county level with

1492
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,240
initiatives like yours and or should we

1493
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
go globally and we don't want to

1494
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,760
reinvent the wheel so in some cases we

1495
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,599
might want to partner with you in some

1496
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,240
cases we might want to do direct copies

1497
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,400
of michigan in some areas we might want

1498
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,440
to

1499
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,000
have parallel experimentation with

1500
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,400
variants to compare notes and see what's

1501
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,920
working what's not

1502
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,520
and to his point

1503
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,839
i'm a huge fan of crisis simulations and

1504
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,760
lightweight tabletop exercises left to

1505
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,280
boom because uh uh to quote the late

1506
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,040
great dan kavinsky of the many things

1507
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,720
that hackers smash

1508
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,160
perhaps the most important is

1509
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,599
assumptions

1510
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,839
and uh i'd rather people figure out what

1511
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:42,800
to do

1512
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,240
in a fake

1513
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,720
crisis than a real one but we don't want

1514
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,359
to

1515
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,760
reinvent the wheel um and we'd love to

1516
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,680
hear what would be the best compliment

1517
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,680
or even partnerships as we had in the

1518
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,960
next nine years of this thing

1519
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,359
i think

1520
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,680
he told me the answer to that when we

1521
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,960
were walking in and i just don't

1522
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,559
remember it but he's gonna answer that

1523
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,760
thanks ray

1524
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,110
um

1525
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,200
[Music]

1526
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,640
i do think that there's a lot of lots of

1527
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,640
synergies that that can be found and

1528
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,119
must be fun i we both

1529
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,119
were saying earlier even if you don't

1530
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,319
remember

1531
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,240
that this kind of volunteer

1532
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,119
activities is brewing up and we see that

1533
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,720
increasingly i'm sure you've read what's

1534
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,640
happening in ukraine with the i.t

1535
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,440
volunteer i.t army over there so there's

1536
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,680
there's this this um interest from

1537
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,359
people to give back which is to me a

1538
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,599
sign that our industry is maturing

1539
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,359
and that we're now in a position to to

1540
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,440
give back where perhaps 10 20 30 years

1541
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,280
ago not everyone was i know that i am

1542
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,880
the cavalry has been has been there for

1543
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
a while but it's not been the case in

1544
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,240
every other country

1545
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,200
um

1546
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,520
civilian and military reserves are

1547
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,960
popping up in different parts of the

1548
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,800
world as well and i i do think that

1549
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,559
there's there's a way to unite all of

1550
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,640
that and to create some kind of a of a

1551
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,040
league or some kind of a network you

1552
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,760
think of b-sides even you know with

1553
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,000
b-sides here but there's also b-sides in

1554
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,319
brussels there's b-sides in in lisbon

1555
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,160
there's b-sides in athens

1556
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,640
and you need to have that kind of local

1557
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,119
element right if you walk with sltts i

1558
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,480
don't think that you can get by with the

1559
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,559
agreements that we have because

1560
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,559
there's just some protections that

1561
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,000
you're gonna need that the government's

1562
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,280
gonna want if you look at uh ngos that

1563
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,800
basically have nothing else it's an

1564
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,319
underserved market they're a little bit

1565
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,200
more

1566
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,040
forgiving when it comes to certain legal

1567
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,720
legal protections and you can do a lot

1568
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
more right so

1569
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,079
there will be differences and there's

1570
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,400
still a need i think to connect locally

1571
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,720
right it's it's uh even in our approach

1572
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,160
i didn't get into that but we use

1573
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,760
regional advisors people who know the

1574
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,960
region well we're able to make

1575
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,359
connections that make sense right and i

1576
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,880
think that if you want things to last

1577
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,319
you need to have this kind of you need

1578
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,880
to know each other so it's i hate to use

1579
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,640
this this world um but it's like this

1580
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,799
glocal it's global and local at the same

1581
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:55,599
time

1582
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,559
so yeah i'm i'm also very eager to give

1583
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,240
back all the things that we're doing you

1584
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,559
know all of this is like we will share

1585
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,040
the intellectual property we help people

1586
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,040
like set up their own things if if we

1587
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,760
can

1588
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,559
grow

1589
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,079
grow this so that more and more people

1590
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,240
can can receive the help right if not

1591
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,119
like

1592
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,319
think of the

1593
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,000
organizations that ray is protecting and

1594
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,280
that the southeast builders aren't

1595
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,839
protecting if you think of the the

1596
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,760
people that they themselves are walking

1597
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,599
with right what internet are we going to

1598
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,760
leave to our kids if it's a place where

1599
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,480
you know the the the data from children

1600
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,520
in schools in kalamazoo get stolen by

1601
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,720
pedophiles if the data from refugees

1602
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,880
fleeing ukraine gets stolen by russia

1603
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,640
like what kind of internet

1604
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,319
did we create and are we living to our

1605
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,640
kids so i think that we have

1606
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,640
we have a window now to create what

1607
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,200
you're talking about josh to fix these

1608
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,359
things at a scale that we haven't been

1609
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,880
able to do before so let's just do it

1610
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,650
[Applause]
