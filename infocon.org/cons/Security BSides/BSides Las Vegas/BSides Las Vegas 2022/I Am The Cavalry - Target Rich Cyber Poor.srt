um

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,799
earlier i asked you guys all applaud for

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
a bunch of volunteers that tried to make

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,600
the world a safer place during the

52
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,799
pandemic

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
two of the career

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
assistants that do it every day not just

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,799
as visiting people for a year or two

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,000
are going to be joining us on stage

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,200
today tom milar and don banak

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,799
great friends of the cavalry movement

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,719
before the pandemic and hopefully still

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,840
after

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
and maybe now even members but

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
what i want to do is bridge that really

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
bad news session that you're in where

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
stops on fire we want to give you a tour

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,640
de force through many of the existence

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,400
proofs because now people know these

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,720
things are flammable it's on john oliver

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,319
you know on hbo

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
my my neighbors are now asking me about

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
these attacks

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,440
but the really sobering and overwhelming

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,200
part including the public-private

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
partnership with government agencies

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
like sysa is that the overwhelming

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,920
majority of these targets are below the

76
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,440
security poverty line they're the target

77
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
rich cyber poor so a lot of the

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
platitudes advice in this cyber security

79
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,480
frameworks we give them are foreign to

80
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
them eighty-five percent of the

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
hospitals of a single security person

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
and if you listen to michelle hulko

83
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
about our ball bearings the most

84
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,360
strategic weak link in the whole supply

85
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
chain for most of our species

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
had two it people no security talent and

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
any minute could have had a denial

88
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
service attack that would have killed

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
another couple hundred thousand

90
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
americans

91
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
uh

92
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
so

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
we tried to get cis out of their comfort

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
zone we came up with a suite of

95
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
pragmatic security suites they're to

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
review this part of this is to educate

97
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,879
you but part of this is to ask and

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
inspire you what else can we do to meet

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
people where they are when they have no

100
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
talent no experience but cyber physical

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
consequences that affect maslow's

102
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
hierarchy so

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,959
they have a short amount of time to show

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
what they've been starting and what

105
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
they've been doing that you can advocate

106
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,760
for but also try to take this as an

107
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
inspiration of what more could the

108
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,640
cavalry

109
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,519
do

110
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,840
to help them help the cyber poor

111
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,080
thanks all right

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,440
y'all hear me

113
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
move this a little closer okay

114
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,959
so um

115
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,959
yeah i told josh i would start off with

116
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
a joke that he might enjoy

117
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
this joke does not represent the

118
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
position of my agency

119
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,200
um or any other employer although i

120
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
can't remember an employer before this

121
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
one i've been in scissor way too long

122
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
um

123
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,439
so i was uh i was on signal with santa

124
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
claus the other night i considered you

125
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,280
know it's always good if you have a good

126
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
idea just go ahead and signal santa

127
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
claus and uh maybe you'll get it for for

128
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
christmas

129
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
um

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
and i asked him for a unicorn

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
he said i'm sorry kiddo we can't do that

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,400
so i asked him i said i would like the

133
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
um the interagency to work together

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,959
seamlessly to solve the cyber security

135
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
crisis in american critical

136
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,358
infrastructure

137
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
and he responded a few minutes later

138
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
with what color unicorn would you like

139
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
hey and it's a joke that works for

140
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,120
everything right you can just put

141
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
whatever in the middle in it and it

142
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,600
works

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
um so

144
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,199
always open with the joke and forget

145
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
what the rest of your agenda was

146
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
um what we're going to do here

147
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,960
we're going to talk a little bit about

148
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,320
how we knew how bad things were before

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
the pandemic even started

150
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,479
give you a little bit of insight into

151
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,600
actually i think these are 2019 so this

152
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
is right after sort of the the birth of

153
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
as an agency these are these are results

154
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,880
from 2019 vulnerability assessments that

155
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,160
we performed at no cost for critical

156
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,919
infrastructure organizations all across

157
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,840
the country including state local

158
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,479
territorial tribal municipal governments

159
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
um and we lined up all the different

160
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,360
ways we knew how to you know without

161
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
fail when we do these assessments we

162
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
find a way in without fail it's the same

163
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,479
stuff over and over and over again so we

164
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,000
created this infographic which i will

165
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
now read every word of to um to explain

166
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
sort of you know like what our findings

167
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,080
were and how they were mapped to mitre

168
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,199
attack

169
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,479
um

170
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,320
but um and this is something obviously

171
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,840
tlp clear

172
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
um

173
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
that uh that you can now get uh for free

174
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
from somewhere on this as a website

175
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
and uh you know i'll hand you a business

176
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
card and find it for you later i'm not

177
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
exactly sure what the search term is

178
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,199
um but here are some links to uh to also

179
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,039
get you started and i want to um by the

180
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,360
way we had the joke earlier the classic

181
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
ronald reagan line of i'm from the

182
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
government and i'm here to help and why

183
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
those are terrifying words i want to

184
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
tweak that

185
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
it's from the government help yourself

186
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
because that's what this i mean when

187
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,400
people ask me

188
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
about our services our resources and the

189
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,960
tools that uh that says offers to help

190
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,319
critical infrastructure but really

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,520
anybody

192
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
because guess what if you are an smb in

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
the united states

194
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
you are probably involved in some

195
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
delivery of a national critical function

196
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,039
um

197
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,880
this has generally been my understanding

198
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
of things the more and more i've learned

199
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
about how our economy works and our way

200
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
of life is

201
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
um is

202
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,120
thought of

203
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
and uh

204
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
and so these are great places to start

205
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
looking at exactly like what we've made

206
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,759
available when people ask me about them

207
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
and they ask you know like oh are these

208
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
available you know what's the cost

209
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,479
i'm like guess what you already paid for

210
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,600
it

211
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,680
um thank you for your contribution to

212
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
the united states treasury um and so

213
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
yeah so these are great links to just

214
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,400
get you started and now what i'm going

215
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,599
to do is i'm going to give you an

216
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,680
example of the spiel i've been using

217
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,240
specifically to cover down on health

218
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
care delivery organizations

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,599
and i know

220
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
spiel like what is he doing up there

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
you're not supposed to do this at these

222
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
types of things but i do want to talk

223
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
about these because of all the problems

224
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
we've been talking about today

225
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
these are the ways we're trying to

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
approach that and tackle it as a scale

227
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
in a scalable fashion one of the big

228
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
challenges we've discovered is that the

229
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
stuff that sort of scaled when we were

230
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
focused um

231
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
primarily on the federal constituency

232
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
that's the federal civilian executive

233
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
branch which for a long time was sort of

234
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
our core audience for a lot of stuff we

235
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
did when we expand that to critical

236
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
infrastructure and we start talking

237
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,440
about numbers in you know

238
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
the uh the mid-four figures just for

239
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,160
hospitals and uh hospital networks alone

240
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
and then we look at all the other

241
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
critical infrastructure sectors those

242
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,000
approaches that work for 125 agencies

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
across the government don't work at uh

244
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
at that scale obviously

245
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
um so let's talk about

246
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
did i move back

247
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
okay

248
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
all right

249
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,479
okay

250
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,800
i have to be like a podcaster don't i

251
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,759
okay

252
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,599
nobody can see my face on the camera but

253
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,080
i can they can hear me so that's fine

254
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,759
um

255
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
so um

256
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,680
somebody get i i asked for a pop star

257
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
mic and they didn't have one

258
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
uh so

259
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
our cyber hygiene services um you know

260
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,919
what i'm not gonna read this whole thing

261
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
because i know this by memory and uh and

262
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
i hate when people read slides to other

263
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,759
people it's the worst

264
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
but um let me start with the simplest

265
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
thing that you can probably take

266
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
advantage of right now that i think is a

267
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
tremendous value that says it offers and

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,279
it's not on the slide it's the known

269
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,519
exploited vulnerabilities catalog

270
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,320
uh who here has already heard of the kev

271
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,080
catalog

272
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
that's outstanding okay do you know

273
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
where to go to get updates whenever we

274
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
put new stuff in the kev catalog

275
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
all right

276
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
that is the national cyber awareness

277
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
system

278
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
so whenever we

279
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,560
so granted you will probably get a

280
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,839
slight

281
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
a slight uptick uptick in email volume

282
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,920
when you sign up for the national cyber

283
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
awareness system but i tell you it's

284
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
absolutely worth the bother

285
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
um i personally have been i mean i work

286
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
for sizza i still subscribe to to

287
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
endcass as we call it um at my personal

288
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,560
account just so i know when you know

289
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
like

290
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,839
when there's new apple ios updates that

291
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
i really need to tell my family about

292
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
for example anything like that and also

293
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
whenever that kev is updated the kev

294
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
catalog gets updated it comes out and is

295
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
announced on the national cyber

296
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
awareness system it's really easy um to

297
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
sign up for the only thing that i think

298
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,120
is perhaps a possible ux design

299
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
challenge is if you go look for the

300
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,959
national cyber awareness system on the

301
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,800
scissor.gov site

302
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
you'll find the page that describes all

303
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
the things that it can do for you

304
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
at the bottom of the page is where you

305
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
sign up to subscribe which i'm like i

306
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,839
might have put that on the top but

307
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,120
anyway

308
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,200
a little editorializing for everybody uh

309
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
everybody who's watching this from my

310
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,080
own agency and wondering how we can

311
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,519
improve the web page

312
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
um

313
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
there's um

314
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
there's also a free open source tool to

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
do your own self assessments which i

316
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,959
don't think a lot of people know about i

317
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,560
mean we we're pretty proud of our

318
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
download numbers but at the same time

319
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,680
when i again when i look at the scale of

320
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,720
what critical infrastructure is um and

321
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,920
the number of people we could be

322
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
reaching i wonder if we're not hitting

323
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
the target um cyber security evaluation

324
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,320
tool or the c-set

325
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
uh and this is

326
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
if you've got the time to go online and

327
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
do one of those goofy personality

328
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
quizzes you've got the time to go

329
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
download the c set it's on this is a

330
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
github

331
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
um

332
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,079
so scissors own github site has the c

333
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,360
set on there it's a standalone

334
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
application you run it and here's the

335
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,680
best part for a lot of folks we don't

336
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
see any of that data unless you make it

337
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
available to us you can keep the data on

338
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,600
your own do your assessment we don't

339
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
have to learn anything from it per se

340
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
we'd like to but it's your information

341
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
and it gives you sort of pathways to

342
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
improving your cyber security posture it

343
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
also has modules for all sorts of

344
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,920
different standards and it has a

345
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
ransomware readiness assessment any of

346
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
this stuff that you can use to support

347
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
your customers

348
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
um or whoever you know if you volunteer

349
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,839
for for someone like the organizations

350
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,720
we've been talking about today um

351
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
any of that i think is

352
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
a possibly an appropriate application of

353
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,519
this tool

354
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,200
um

355
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
there's also i'm gonna let don cover

356
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
this in greater detail we have

357
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,880
representatives we're not just a

358
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
washington dc agency we have

359
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
representatives in all 50 states and six

360
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,399
territories

361
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
um covering the entire united states we

362
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
have a cyber security advisor in alaska

363
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,920
so we've got it covered down and um and

364
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,320
i think we are up to

365
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
specifically the state cyber security

366
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
advisors that last time i checked we had

367
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
40 out of 50 were hired

368
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
and uh and that was progressing very

369
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
well for us

370
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
so those are where you can get a lot of

371
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
other different types of assessments

372
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
from people who actually will come and

373
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
visit you in your

374
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
own operating environment

375
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,639
and um

376
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
did i do it again

377
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
oh 10 minutes okay and i really wanted

378
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
to have a discussion so here's some

379
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,320
stuff cyber hygiene services um one one

380
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,639
thing real quick these are no cost

381
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
assessment services they are utilized by

382
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
um there are a variety of things i will

383
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,839
let you look it up in your own time a

384
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
bunch of this stuff is i just want you

385
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
to encourage you can encourage you to

386
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,279
take a look at scissor.gov search around

387
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,959
for some of these key terms and find out

388
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
what the services are and if they're a

389
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
good fit

390
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
um

391
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,959
and uh

392
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
and yeah the cyber hygiene services are

393
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
a great way to start if you know an

394
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,639
organization for example that has an

395
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,480
asset management problem they just don't

396
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
even know what they have

397
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,560
um using cyber hygiene services is a

398
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
great way to get started just like

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,279
finding out at least what's the

400
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
interface internet facing stuff

401
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
along with the stuff off search um

402
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
toolkit which gives you a way to find

403
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,200
the things that were already on census

404
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
and showdown that maybe you didn't know

405
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,120
were internet facing and discoverable um

406
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
and that gives you a great start i

407
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
believe in at least solving part of the

408
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
asset management challenge we know so

409
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,480
many of these organizations are facing

410
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
with that i want to turn it over to more

411
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,639
of a discussion

412
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,600
um

413
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
and a little bit of q a but mostly i

414
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,920
would love to hear your ideas for what

415
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
else we could be doing especially to

416
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
help smbs um and critical like the

417
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,680
critical national infrastructure that

418
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
you all have experience with

419
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,959
and also let don talk for a minute

420
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
a minute that's outstanding um

421
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,600
closer okay so i've spent the last 15

422
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
years in government developing services

423
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
to help organizations manage their risk

424
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
from the cyber hygiene suite which is

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
ostensibly focused on attack surface

426
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
management identification of exposed web

427
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
web applications system vulnerabilities

428
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,480
um

429
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,639
pen testing services being available to

430
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,800
all and the real question is

431
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
what do we what do we do next because we

432
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
have things that worked great federally

433
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
and they they were kind of bespoke you

434
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,160
know kind of like bentleys um we had

435
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,199
some services that are kind of like

436
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
bicycles they were great for the masses

437
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,079
so on that spectrum of bikes to bentleys

438
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,680
where you know we can use the bikes and

439
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,680
they should be public goods what can i

440
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
do to help or what can we do to help

441
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,560
develop services that the field forces

442
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
can deliver that

443
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
cisco can deliver from headquarters that

444
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,839
help the masses understand the scope the

445
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,360
magnitude of the risk what's missing

446
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
from our current suite of cyber hygiene

447
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
services um and then for the more

448
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
bespoke sets where we we operationally

449
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,600
engage with

450
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
known nodes vital vital vital junctures

451
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
around krog infrastructure what are kind

452
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
of the more bespoke services that would

453
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
help when there's our eye on that and

454
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
that's two different muscle movements

455
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
one available to the masses one

456
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
available to a smaller set of

457
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,680
very focused important organizations um

458
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
and i'm looking for ideas from you what

459
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,320
could we do that we're not doing i don't

460
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
want to just tell you my ideas i just

461
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
want to listen to yours so that was why

462
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
i tried to stay silent for a change

463
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
anybody who's ever done a meeting with

464
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
me knows i talk

465
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,360
too much so one a third a third muscle

466
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,480
movement is also the uh the uh the tide

467
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,959
that lifts off ships option and that's

468
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,120
uh my friend allen is wearing the shirt

469
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
representative of his major effort in

470
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,320
that rail the software bill of materials

471
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,000
um

472
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,560
[Music]

473
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,519
yay

474
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,839
and i want to bring up like an example

475
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,160
of the bad practices because i know josh

476
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
is probably going to uh

477
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,360
have words with me if i don't bring up

478
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
the bad practices um there's only three

479
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
bad practices that we published on this

480
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
is a website they're really simple and i

481
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
think they're non-controversial until i

482
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,759
talk to somebody who actually works in

483
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,480
healthcare but um

484
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,279
but uh one of them the first one is

485
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,959
don't use end of life don't use

486
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,199
unsupported stuff second one is don't

487
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,360
use stuff with um

488
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
with known default fixed passwords and

489
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,800
the third one is don't use single factor

490
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,240
authentication for remote or

491
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
administrative access

492
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
and again all of these are

493
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
non-controversial right but we provided

494
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
them to give people ammunition to start

495
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,839
winning arguments it's like hey these

496
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,199
are the scissor bad practices we

497
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
shouldn't be doing this so

498
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
and the bad practices were always

499
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,320
supposed to be a living document they

500
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,399
were always supposed to provide you know

501
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
a dialogue space where we could talk to

502
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
experts like yourselves what else should

503
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
be in that list of bad practices or what

504
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
else which should we be looking out for

505
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
again another place where your ideas

506
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
would be absolutely welcome we also find

507
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,639
those on our great hub site

508
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,639
we'd love public actual q a time

509
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,680
sorry you're fine

510
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
uh well

511
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
it would be nice to have something

512
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
like your cyber resilience uh graphic

513
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
novel series i'd love to see something

514
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
that's uh

515
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
effectively like uh captain planet right

516
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,440
like

517
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
that made environmental awareness uh a

518
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,199
huge thing for me when i was a kid it'd

519
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
be nice if we had something that taught

520
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
children about cyber security mdm like

521
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
something that made it uh

522
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,599
more accessible entertaining

523
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,280
that would be really nice

524
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,679
the second thing is uh maybe impossible

525
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,000
but a tiger team of sorts

526
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
uh i forget which presenter was talking

527
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,559
about it maybe it was bryce how

528
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,439
uh

529
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
the entities that are large enough to

530
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,400
ask for your services are not

531
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,679
necessarily the ones that need them

532
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,000
right the small entities

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
don't have cyber security uh they might

534
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,160
have i.t people so they really need

535
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,280
someone

536
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,679
who's a sysadmin net admin exchange

537
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,080
admin someone who knows security

538
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
practices to come in assess their

539
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,200
environment and

540
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
clean things up because they don't have

541
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
the ability to even do that

542
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
i like both those ideas and we have a

543
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,880
number of staff in the field again i'm

544
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
looking for ideas for for the field

545
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,000
courses so this is this is great there's

546
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,919
actually over 130 of them and i think

547
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,160
another 40 or 50 that we're hiring so we

548
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
have a lot of regional forces spread

549
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
across all 50 states and you know right

550
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
now it's it's green it's a it's a blank

551
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
slate sky's limit on what we can what we

552
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,039
can do and think about doing with them

553
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,240
thank you gentlemen thank you for having

554
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
this open forum i i work specifically

555
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
with a lot of smbs in

556
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,480
digital forensics and incident response

557
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,360
uniformly

558
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,720
small medium enterprises non-technical

559
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
decision makers

560
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,440
think that information security is an

561
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
i.t problem

562
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
and they look to their i.t people who

563
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
may be great at setting up printers or

564
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,960
putting workstations together you know

565
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
the break fix it outsource people and

566
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
then information security and incident

567
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
response gets dumped on them

568
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
and they are out of their element

569
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
and

570
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
broadening the understanding among smbs

571
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,039
that information security incident

572
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,520
response these are different disciplines

573
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
than their i.t guy

574
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,799
and they

575
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,918
they don't know that at all

576
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,120
uh to follow on that it seems

577
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,320
like resources that

578
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,919
help educate these smb executives that

579
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
it's a risk management decision and

580
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,760
assessment

581
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
for operating their business it affects

582
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
bottom line it affects the future

583
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,760
viability of the business

584
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
and just keep bringing it to them so

585
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
maybe a quarterly report that says hey

586
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
here's went on last quarter in the

587
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
language of smbs speaking to the

588
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,840
concerns that you know really hit them

589
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
and here's some free resources for

590
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
understanding risk management or some

591
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
really

592
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
easy to use online tools to get started

593
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
with this risk management

594
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
because they're not trained in that they

595
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,039
don't they don't really know how to run

596
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,799
it but got to be good if they had some

597
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,559
resources to to help them grow there

598
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
yeah and i think you're going to see a

599
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,860
lot over the next year from cisa

600
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,200
[Music]

601
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
if i'm successful and others are

602
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
engaging at the c-suite and above so

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
board members

604
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,559
ceos cios cfos we want to change it from

605
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,159
a narrative around information security

606
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
cyber security into business continuity

607
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
business resilience um so we'll we'll be

608
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,159
doing a lot there that's not going to

609
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,520
help with direct services to help the

610
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
cyber poor but it's going to help get i

611
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,840
think the right buy-in

612
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
yep

613
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
so i'm 100 gonna echo what this

614
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
gentleman just said

615
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,159
your target audience it sounds like it

616
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
needs to come from the top down as well

617
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,799
as the bottom up i think the bottom up

618
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,840
gets it the top down doesn't necessarily

619
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,600
understand all the complexities so if

620
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
there's always gonna sound really bad

621
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,760
dumbing it down to the level that

622
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,159
somebody can look at and go i don't get

623
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
the technical but i now got a better

624
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
understanding of the risk

625
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,039
the money and i got a better

626
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
understanding of what the environment

627
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,720
looks like

628
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
they speak a different language

629
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
well and i think there's a there's a

630
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,799
thread i want to pull on between what

631
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,120
you said and what you brought up as well

632
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
i think one problem is that at some

633
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,280
point

634
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
you know there was when i t was a way to

635
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
be competitive you would invest in i.t

636
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
that would make you more competitive

637
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,159
than the guy down the street then

638
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
at some point in our history it became

639
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,120
purely a cost center in the way that

640
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,039
they look at it and that means you know

641
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,240
like all these investments we're talking

642
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
about and risk management get lost

643
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,320
because you know we're we're not having

644
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,600
that conversation we're just talking

645
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
about it as a cost center and all these

646
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,200
problems are i t related therefore

647
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
you get you get the picture and we need

648
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,679
to have you know like no this is

649
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,360
basically just like insurance or

650
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
anything else where you would you would

651
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,240
invest

652
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
to make sure that your business stays

653
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
afloat down the line

654
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
so you've mentioned that

655
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,159
you have a variety of different services

656
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
that are available and you know once

657
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,520
again organizations can go ahead and you

658
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,080
know run them run them locally choose to

659
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
either share or not share the results

660
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,440
question for you um you know your first

661
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
slide that you had when we all came in

662
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,919
here

663
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,200
essentially had your common

664
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
vulnerabilities and

665
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
the miter attack framework

666
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
have you looked at potentially going

667
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
ahead and

668
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,440
building essentially an integration

669
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,480
between

670
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,679
that

671
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,159
and your various different services so

672
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
that you know if you're supporting you

673
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,159
know a joe blow

674
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
you know i t focused ciso

675
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
who really

676
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
you know he's focused on compliance

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
whack-a-mole and that's about it

678
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
when it comes down to it you can go

679
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,120
ahead and have one of these services run

680
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
and then put it into that framework to

681
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,440
go ahead and basically benchmark

682
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
essentially that organization's

683
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
capabilities against various different

684
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,440
threat actors

685
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
so that you can profile this right

686
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,799
because a threat profile to a small

687
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,000
business that's doing software

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,080
development versus a healthcare business

689
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,640
versus a fed civ organization has very

690
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
different threat profiles

691
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
and in the grand scheme of things

692
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,600
you know it's part of an education

693
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
factor for the senior decision makers to

694
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,919
actually understand what's important and

695
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,440
what you know

696
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,279
i mean what are their crown jewels and

697
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,760
and ultimately what could be the actual

698
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
impacts if they had a breach or if they

699
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,880
actually found out they had a breach

700
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,039
so

701
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
so yes we're definitely headed in that

702
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,799
direction

703
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,440
i will spill a little bit of tea and

704
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
reveal that one of the challenges is

705
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
conway's law related the people that are

706
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,480
like super good at understanding and

707
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,720
doing the threat stuff are not in the

708
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
same org chart bubble as me

709
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,039
and alan for example so it's like the

710
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,919
pro the proactive preventative focused

711
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
folks are not always having the most

712
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
we could be having more conversations

713
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,720
with all of our threat folks

714
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
and that's probably true almost

715
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
everywhere

716
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,039
i think that there's not a hammer right

717
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,480
like

718
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,919
i worked for the state

719
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,720
um

720
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
the great state

721
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
and there was a hammer there with state

722
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
auditor's office there was a hammer

723
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
there with a legislative budget board

724
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,840
i think with the municipalities and the

725
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,039
smbs unless you tie it to money and we

726
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,480
gave a ton of money out during the

727
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
pandemic like

728
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
i almost felt like there should be a bar

729
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
before before more free stuff's given

730
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
because otherwise they just take it and

731
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,600
they don't do anything with it if that

732
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,310
makes any sense

733
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,349
[Music]

734
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
and lastly

735
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
will hurt was the only congressman that

736
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,000
i know that would come out and talk

737
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,159
about cyber security and he left because

738
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,559
of his issues with the former president

739
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,159
there's nobody there now that i know of

740
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,760
right and even at the state level

741
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
there's like one guy and he admittedly

742
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,120
says

743
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
the only reason i'm cyber security guys

744
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
because i worked at radio shack in the

745
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
80s right

746
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
who who's our who are our elected

747
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,679
officials that we could

748
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,080
you know lobby if you will

749
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
by writing to them and getting more

750
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,480
involved

751
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
okay i think we are out of formal time

752
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
but because we have a break

753
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
please keep this conversation going uh

754
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
and while they can't speak on behalf of

755
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
their agency about litigations and

756
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,360
whatnot i can tell you that i've been

757
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,520
telling the senate that these freely

758
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,120
available services

759
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
should probably be on the short list

760
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,320
that if you want to claim safe harbor

761
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,240
you probably should have been doing

762
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
these things so you could do the similar

763
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,760
thing so

764
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
um please help them please advocate and

765
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
the last one all nudged and someone

766
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,880
brought it up is very few people know

767
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
about these free services so i would

768
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,159
encourage a budget for adoption and

769
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
awareness that is sector specific to

770
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,559
these target rich cyber poor across the

771
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
16 critical infrastructure sectors just

772
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,559
remember they're not free

773
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,158
they are no cost prepaid

774
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,779
[Music]

775
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,039
so when i hear uh safe harbor it harkens

776
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,360
back to the pci dss days

777
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
where they came in and said hey

778
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,960
you know you don't have to comply but if

779
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,120
you something happens

780
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,240
you're you're completely out of luck and

781
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,360
so complying brought you some of that

782
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,600
peace of mind which brings me to my next

783
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
question is has thought been put into

784
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,440
play uh regarding creation or expansion

785
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
of business cases

786
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,720
that can be handed to the it department

787
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,480
who's going i don't know this stuff and

788
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,960
i know i don't know so let me take this

789
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
and i can pass this up i don't have to

790
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
develop it i mean we see it for

791
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,520
conferences

792
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,960
where a conference says here's your

793
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
business case for you to you only have

794
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
to create it hand it to your boss and

795
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,159
say where's my money to go

796
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,559
learn which gives me this value if the

797
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,760
fed gov provided something like that

798
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
it takes it empowers those

799
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,799
individuals that know they don't know

800
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,440
which is the first step and be able to

801
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,919
not have to spend their valuable time

802
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,039
trying to figure out how to write this

803
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,360
proposal in such a way that an executive

804
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,240
might be interested and then doing it at

805
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,399
some level of cyber security maturity

806
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,799
model i mean it's a little advanced but

807
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
saying like hey you know mom and pop smb

808
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,480
versus next you know one two three four

809
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,600
you know by the time you get four i

810
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
don't need it but just a thought

811
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,399
yeah

812
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,559
i really like this idea it kind of takes

813
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,279
and turns the bad practices on its head

814
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,960
the bad practices are ammunition to

815
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,799
start having difficult conversations

816
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
about let's get all of you like we've

817
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
got to figure out how we're going to

818
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,080
plan to rip and replace the end of life

819
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,279
stuff

820
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,240
um for one example but to provide that

821
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
you know more detailed business case

822
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,440
than just being able to point to a page

823
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
and say it's on the bad practices list

824
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
we could say like and here's the

825
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
document you know more or less the

826
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
boilerplate language

827
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,080
to carry that forward and one of the

828
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
accompanying documents to the bad

829
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,240
practices preceded bad practices is

830
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
there's cis cyber essentials and the

831
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,880
cyber essentials the genesis for them

832
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,080
came from

833
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
multiple years we looked across five

834
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
years of data every incident reported to

835
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
us sir to the end kick to dhs over five

836
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
years every assessment we did over five

837
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
years which was thousands we do about

838
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,799
500 a year

839
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
every bit of data we had from our public

840
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
cyber hygiene services which is about 4

841
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
000 customers getting continuous ongoing

842
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
uh tax service management type services

843
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
looking across all that data um doing

844
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
reverse mapping of root causes what's

845
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
what was successful what was on what was

846
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,200
what was it the root cause of incidence

847
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,399
what was always successful for the for

848
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,399
the assessment teams um

849
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
mapping that to the attack minor attack

850
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
framework then looking for corresponding

851
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,919
controls and percolating out a kind of a

852
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,159
heat map of the top cyber essential

853
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,600
controls that would mitigate most of

854
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
that risk that's what's embodied in the

855
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
cyber essentials so when you're buying

856
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
into those when we say assista these are

857
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
the essential practices and it's only

858
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,200
about

859
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,600
10 to 15. i can't remember we

860
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,120
we did it in response to ransomware so

861
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
it started a couple years ago um turns

862
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
out the general case for ransomware

863
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
there was one additional capability to

864
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
make it general to everything that

865
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,120
wasn't ransomware as well so ransomware

866
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,679
an attack is an attack at this point

867
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,080
and those practices embody the most

868
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,200
important things you can do cost

869
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,960
effectively to buy down there's a couple

870
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,200
do immediately run don't stop you know

871
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
do not pass go collect 200 type things

872
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,679
and that's you know protective dns

873
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,919
multi-factor authentication turn on auto

874
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,520
updates um so there are there are a

875
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
couple really simple things you can do

876
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,200
as an organization that buy down a

877
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
tremendous amount of risk and continuous

878
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,799
backups to cloud

879
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,600
you know

880
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,840
with with rollback capability

881
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
all right to build on this one this is

882
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,039
an area that there will be constraints

883
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,559
on what federal employees can say

884
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
especially when it's not

885
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,559
a regulator of these sectors and that

886
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,840
has to fight conway's law and other turf

887
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,159
wars with like health and human services

888
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,120
or epa environmental protection agency

889
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,159
for water so there's going to be some

890
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,919
turf wars that you know our team

891
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,440
focus on the outcome of the mission

892
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,919
instead of the org chart but the natural

893
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,039
muscle memory is going to be a little

894
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,799
more territorial so this is an area i

895
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,159
think perhaps the cavalry could do in

896
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,159
the next phase which is could we start

897
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,360
to write

898
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,600
fit for purpose sector specific advice

899
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
that isn't just

900
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
here's bad practices across these

901
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,399
sectors but

902
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,000
yeah you've got a bunch of unsupported

903
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,320
and end of life devices in medical

904
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,080
uh and we know you can't replace them

905
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
all what do we do about it can we have a

906
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
five-year five-year plan 10-year plan

907
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,240
prioritized list of how to identify and

908
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
buy down risk

909
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
for the most egregious ones

910
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
and even facilitate roundtables and

911
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,519
critical conversations maybe capture

912
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,039
those and then maybe have a document of

913
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,919
these are the things you're going to

914
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,679
encounter when you try to do it

915
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,960
we've encountered them already here's

916
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
how we've overcome them so i think

917
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
there's going to be a certain amount we

918
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
can ask of cisa and we want to we want

919
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,000
to push them

920
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,760
and we want to push their sibling

921
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
agencies to embrace them

922
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,120
and there's going to be a line they

923
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,279
can't cross and perhaps we could take it

924
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,559
a little further

925
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,080
if we get creative and there's people in

926
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,120
this room that work in each of those

927
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
critical infrastructure sectors who

928
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,399
might be able to take the pen and start

929
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
drafting here's the top three things

930
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,159
wastewater should understand here's the

931
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,519
top three things hospitals should

932
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
understand here's the top three things

933
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,200
and as long as we keep knocking those

934
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
lists down we might actually get

935
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
movement

936
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,279
so there's a you know a need for the

937
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,000
smaller businesses to get help right and

938
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
then there's a workforce problem where

939
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
the running joke is a entry level job

940
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,799
need 20 years of prior experience cssp

941
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,080
and about 40 certificates right

942
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
so is there a an appetite to build like

943
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
a dating app where like hey these people

944
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
need your services and then like a

945
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,399
volunteer volunteer

946
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,720
corps we're like hey look i'm trying to

947
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
get into it or i have some free cycles

948
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
i'd be willing to help out and do some

949
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,480
matching there something like the civil

950
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
air patrol or coast guard auxiliary

951
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,159
right

952
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,640
it gets a little tricky for us to do

953
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,039
something quite that specific government

954
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,799
endorsement and other

955
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,240
legalities that we

956
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,360
don't

957
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,000
we just can't cross into but

958
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
i i think

959
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,159
i don't know it's a a it's a big policy

960
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,039
question

961
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
i would say right now there are there

962
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,360
are interesting conversations

963
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
um

964
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,519
that i think are being had around the

965
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,279
idea of a civil cyber defense force

966
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,519
um thank you because because i read law

967
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,279
fair right so but there is the joint

968
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
cyber defense collaborative that we're

969
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,919
standing up with a partnership with

970
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,080
industry there are shared services we're

971
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,039
standing up um to provide opportunities

972
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,720
for at least government state local

973
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,960
tribal and federal to bioshared services

974
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
i don't know to what extent we'll be

975
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
able to one day offer that to critical

976
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,919
infrastructure or not um but there's

977
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,600
also a big narrative for small medium

978
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,360
businesses

979
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
um

980
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,399
you know 99 of businesses in the us are

981
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,279
small medium um and and the reality is

982
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,799
and this this is uh kind of one of the

983
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,640
ransomware talking points

984
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
if you're not resourced maybe you

985
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
shouldn't try to do it yourself right

986
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,720
there's there's a push for

987
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,240
by the commodity

988
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
because you can't compete with the

989
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
budgets that federal agencies have or

990
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,039
the fortune 500 have or even the fortune

991
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,679
1000 if you're small your best bet may

992
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,679
be to just outsource as much of this as

993
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,519
you can to someone that is resourced to

994
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,919
do it and then at at the scissor level

995
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,080
it becomes more scalable for us to pitch

996
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,399
in because instead of targeting the

997
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,000
storefront and trying to deliver

998
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,679
services to all the storefronts out

999
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,720
there we go one level upstream to the

1000
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
service providers and make sure the

1001
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,240
service providers are scared squared

1002
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,960
away this is a kind of an epiphany i had

1003
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,079
dealing with

1004
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,480
um dealing with hdos i was like there's

1005
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,719
6 000 of these how am i going to reach

1006
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,000
them and let them know about all the

1007
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,599
stuff that i want to you know give them

1008
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
at no cost

1009
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
and uh and then i realized you know like

1010
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,280
for some of these things like electronic

1011
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
healthcare record providers there's

1012
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,719
really only two

1013
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,119
so we go make sure they're squared away

1014
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,918
we've actually made a big difference in

1015
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,839
the in the real attack surface

1016
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,159
so

1017
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,639
the one idea that i had responsive to

1018
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,520
your question is and maybe this is where

1019
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,560
we have an inter-departmental discussion

1020
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,679
of missed and cisa

1021
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,079
and using the nice platform in education

1022
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,719
regarding cyber security to

1023
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,839
try to try to work

1024
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,640
a whole of government for workforce

1025
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
development and that and

1026
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,839
smaller not

1027
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,680
not everything should be in the silo we

1028
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
should try to figure out how to not be

1029
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,720
so silent

1030
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,119
that gives me an opportunity to pitch my

1031
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,960
favorite program in the entire federal

1032
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,720
government which is not really which is

1033
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,480
kind of a says a thing but it's really a

1034
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,400
dhs nsa

1035
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,240
uh nist and opm thing and nsf so it's

1036
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,680
actually an interagency thing that's

1037
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,359
really working out it's called

1038
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,839
scholarship for service

1039
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,200
and if you've never heard of that

1040
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,919
go to sfs.opm.gov

1041
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,480
and tell that to and share that with

1042
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
anybody who is entering or possibly

1043
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,000
considering a change of careers or

1044
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
entering college for the first time or

1045
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,440
trying to get a graduate degree and want

1046
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,520
somebody to help pay for it basically

1047
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,720
what it is

1048
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,599
we can put money down we will put up

1049
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
i think two up to two years worth

1050
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
um meaning the individual upon

1051
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,240
graduation and achieving satisfactory

1052
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
all the things

1053
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
will uh will come and be eligible to get

1054
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,440
um

1055
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,240
a fast track to a federal hire for two

1056
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
years work as a federal employee and

1057
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,079
then they are free to do whatever they

1058
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,520
need to do

1059
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
but um it's a great program for not only

1060
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,240
for bringing talent for us which is

1061
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
where you know my altruism ends you know

1062
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,599

1063
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,000
smart young you know smart hungry people

1064
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,680
i shouldn't say young it's all kinds of

1065
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,720
walks of life and ages but um

1066
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
uh sfs is not only good for that but it

1067
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,280
also provides a great stream of people

1068
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,920
who are done with their federal time and

1069
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,599

1070
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,839
