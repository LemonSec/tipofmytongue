we're gonna talk a little bit about uh

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,840
zero days uh response to those i've been

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,760
in infosec since uh the late 90s

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
and whereas i feel like you've kind of

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
been in the management

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
you know senior track i've been the

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
person who's like always been under that

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
i do work i do work do you sometimes

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,720
sorry

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
i don't actually do but you know when

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
you're the person you know with your

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
boss breathing down your neck like what

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
your next move is is very critical so

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,680
we're going to talk a little bit about

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
taking the guesswork out of that process

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
and how to make you more successful

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
dealing with zero days

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
so let's get started

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
and so a big fan of the office uh i'm

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
not gonna lie when i went and looked for

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
an example and i found this clip

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
i lost about three hours watching uh

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
clips of the office

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,040
uh if you go to youtube and you do fire

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
drill in the office

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
i'm not responsible for the next three

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
hours you guys lose but it's awesome and

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,080
essentially it is saying you know

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,239
dwight had a fire drill and nobody did

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,200
anything

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
so then dwight had another fire drill

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
and it went the other direction

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
and so we want to say that you know

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
how often are we going to have a

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
vulnerability coming out

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,239
and what time does it come out friday at

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,760
3 o'clock

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,239
so log 4 j is going to come out before

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,840
the holidays

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
on a friday at 3 o'clock

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
how much of our life should we be given

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
up and what can we do to kind of turn

107
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
that around

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
hey just a quick note

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
the the other

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,040
most awesome episode of the office is

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
when dwight cuts a face off of the cpr

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
dummy and then puts it on his face and

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
he's like hello clarice remember that

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,319
one

115
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
and so when we get to questions

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,680
if you don't have a question about

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
our talk anybody's willing to willing to

118
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,918
can try to

119
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,238
stump tony on movies

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
give him a live movie and he should be

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
able to do it so we should have some

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
questions

123
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,759
all right so let's talk about some

124
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
examples here's uh kind of a whole

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,800
myriad of examples and you'll notice too

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
that these uh arrive

127
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
in your uh you know in your um

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
life in a number of different ways right

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,040
solarwinds this is like supply chain

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
like a product that you're using where's

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
that product installed who's the product

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
owner who's the owner of the server that

133
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
the products are installed on that's a

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
very different story from

135
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
like a large scale

136
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,759
you know like heartbleed or log4j a

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,960
protocol

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
related

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
risk those require a whole different

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,000
group of people to be contacted and to

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
respond

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
to this incident

143
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
and then going down you look at things

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
that are kind of status quo parts of

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
your infrastructure that you're using

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,280
um you know they're they're obviously

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
you know there was a great talk the

148
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
other day about devsecops

149
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
and how it's failing

150
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,360
um it was actually in this room um and

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
the funny part is most people always

152
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,479
talk about

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,039
dev and sec the ops part

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,360
uh is all the other

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,039
uh all the other things that have to

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,280
happen for devon sec to work properly

157
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
because implementation deployment um

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,919
who's using those systems that's the

159
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,400
operational aspect and then obviously

160
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,120
stuxnet um you know a meltdown spectre

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
these are

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
things that most people aren't really

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,919
prepared for in general right because

164
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,720
these are these are vulnerabilities or

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
you know exploit

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
attempts will be happening against

167
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,840
systems at the very deepest root of your

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
of your environment so it obviously

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
requires a different perspective

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
and you know again this is a team sport

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,759
so as soon as i hear

172
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,240
about what's going on i've got two

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
challenges

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
where is it in my environment and where

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
is it in my critical provider's

176
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
environment

177
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
and so you know you need both those

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
process you need to have thought through

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,120
on you know as soon as i start on my

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
checklist

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
i have a partner in vendor management

182
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
who's going through

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
so at nordstrom we have

184
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,960
had

185
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
and my wife is very mad that i moved

186
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,800
away from the nordstrom discount

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
but the

188
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,360
we had 5 000 vendors

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
so then we had a category of which of

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
those vendors had our customer data

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
which of them had credit card data you

192
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
know

193
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
some of them were just

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
they were in our system so when we sold

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,039
a pair of shoes they sent us another

196
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
pair of shoes

197
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
some of them knew who bought it what it

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,319
was for

199
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
and so you know that's that's the first

200
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
one the next is where is it in my

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,080
environment

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
how many have a lot of confidence in

203
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,840
their asset management system

204
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,000
you're in trouble

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,039
how many people have an s-bomb

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,039
you know where all their log4j is and

207
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,000
all that

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
that is awesome

209
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,080
working on it nice to see

210
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,479
i have this going next to me y'all take

211
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,520
your mask off and yell

212
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
you have an s bomb do you know if it's

213
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
correct if it covers all your stuff

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
you know and then

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
firmware

216
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,960
how many had a process when spectre came

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
out to patch firmware

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
i mean for us that was a new process we

219
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,680
had to develop and so i and is iot in

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
your asset management system today

221
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,759
or is that

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
just a rogue system not considered

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
to have data on it so it's not in your

224
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
asset management and so the reason we

225
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
built these out just like when you're

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
doing data breach i think you know

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,280
third-party data loss i lost data

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
i lost access to ransomware

229
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
you know there are classic scenarios you

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,400
should go through in your planning and

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
we think this is a framework

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
yeah the last point too um especially

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,919
when you're talking about where these

234
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,080
things exist in your environment

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
um

236
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
we you know he just mentioned about

237
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,599
s-bombs right a software bill of

238
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,360
materials

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
there's a lot of especially on the iot

240
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
side

241
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
uh the kind of the antithesis of s-bomb

242
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,200
is

243
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
do you have a problem maybe scanning

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
into your environment because of risk of

245
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,959
these fragile tcp stacks being

246
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
knocked over from your asset

247
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
identification scanning tools right so

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,720
there's a there's a big play there are

249
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
you really catching everything that

250
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
could be at risk here from these types

251
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,360
of

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
vulnerabilities and if you're trying to

253
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
figure out why the raiders are up there

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,560
it's because i live in colorado

255
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
and this is one of the few safe places i

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
can put a raider logo up

257
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
so while in vegas i'm going to take

258
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,760
advantage of that opportunity

259
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,320
so

260
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
i think part of the problem today is

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
we think of a zero day as an incident

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
and these are

263
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
our two classic processes

264
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,800
to deal with an incident

265
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
i'm saying that a zero day is not an

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
incident

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
it is a systemic problem

268
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
and it belongs in a different box

269
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
i think it belongs in crisis management

270
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
it's not something that's going to be

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
finished out in the sock more often than

272
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
not

273
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
it's not a quick remediation with our

274
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
tools

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,519
again it's a committee it is a large

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,040
phone call

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,560
you know when

278
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,079
the ceo

279
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,279
hears about log4j on npr on his drive in

280
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,880
what's the first phone call you're gonna

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,800
get that day

282
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
you know and so

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
it's notification

284
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,920
it is

285
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
having a coordinated response who needs

286
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,279
to be notified for what at what level of

287
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
incident does it

288
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
um

289
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
so

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
again a customer's going to hear about

291
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
log4j and they're going to call the call

292
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
center

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
and the call center is going to be asked

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,600
is my data safe from log4j

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,920
does your call center have any idea what

296
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
they were just asked

297
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,000
so again i don't think this belongs in

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
crisis management because you need a

299
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,880
message for people that call in

300
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
the next person that's going to call

301
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
when i was a cso for nordstrom bank is

302
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
the feds

303
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
the occ

304
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
they're going to call and say

305
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,440
what's a risk to the bank

306
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,480
are you guys safe

307
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,760
so you have this constant stream which

308
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,720
is why

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,079
i think we should move it out of

310
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
incident response into crisis management

311
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,760
and follow that same thing

312
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,120
and so one of the things that is

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,959
you know

314
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,200
which systems impacted by wannacry log4j

315
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
pick your pick your zero day of of

316
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
choice solar winds

317
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
what access

318
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
was it to data

319
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
tony was talking about solarwinds who

320
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
was running it

321
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
i don't care who was running it

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
what was on it what kind of information

323
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,639
was involved

324
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
is it customer information is it

325
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
infrastructure information

326
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
those are different reactions those are

327
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
different people i have to notify

328
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
if there's customer information in there

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
now i'm calling privacy they need to be

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
on the phone call

331
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,279
if we lost it i have 72 hours to notify

332
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
somebody

333
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
and so you see where i'm going

334
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
um

335
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
and then again i can't bang on this drum

336
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,200
hard enough

337
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
i need you to be in lockstep with your

338
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
vendor management or whoever's going to

339
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
own

340
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,399
all that others

341
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
and so for log4j

342
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
what's a reasonable amount of

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
and this is manual i haven't seen any

344
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
program and if somebody has let me know

345
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
to automate this

346
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
where you're calling your key vendors

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
and saying are you secure from log4j you

348
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
have my customer data what's your plan

349
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,079
and what are they doing they're doing

350
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,079
the same thing you're doing trying to

351
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,760
figure out if you even had that protocol

352
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
anywhere

353
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,279
so it's not a quick call and done

354
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
no no go ahead

355
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
uh so so this goes back to what we were

356
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
talking about before uh there are a lot

357
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
of different people if you look at the

358
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
racy chart at the bottom

359
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
this really depicts who is responsible

360
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
for getting that ring

361
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
uh into the flames uh to destroy it

362
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
right um

363
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
but uh you know when as you kind of map

364
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
out who in your environment needs to be

365
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
contacted there's some really kind of

366
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,639
practical things you can do so one if

367
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,000
you've ever done like a tabletop

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,079
exercise think of something where you're

369
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
under duress right so

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,800
uh so we work a lot with uh you know

371
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
large-scale web app attacks or ddos

372
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,399
attacks

373
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,079
and you'd be surprised going through a

374
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,519
tabletop exercise uh before we go

375
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
through the process of developing one

376
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
you just say hey you're under attack

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
what do you do they're like okay we're

378
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
gonna call our two contact people in

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
network ops and blah blah blah

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,000
and then they don't answer the phone

381
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,920
because it's lunchtime or it's midnight

382
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
where they live

383
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,639
what do you do next right who's the

384
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,320
second person to call on the call tree

385
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
how do you uh transfer responsibility at

386
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
what point do you open up a bridge and

387
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
you say hey we're gonna have a

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
a bridge that's open from now until this

389
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
this attack is remediated to where

390
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,160
anyone who needs to know needs to be

391
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,079
notified of what's going on they know

392
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
this is the bridge to call into right

393
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
there's a lot of procedures that can be

394
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,760
done beforehand to save time because

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,839
when you're under duress when you're

396
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
uh you know when you're hard down or

397
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
uh if you've failed over to your

398
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,360
failover data center just say and god

399
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,199
forbid your failover data center is not

400
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,560
failing over

401
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
um

402
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,360
you know everyone starts to get red in

403
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
the face they start to make poor

404
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
decisions

405
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
uh and you frankly you have

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
you know somebody that looks like this

407
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,800
standing over your shoulder just

408
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,279
that was that was not cool uh but you

409
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,920
have like true you have your boss

410
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,519
looking right over your shoulder and

411
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
you're just like

412
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,880
i've got to focus i've got to remain

413
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
calm the more planning you can put into

414
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
this whole procedure here

415
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,079
for who's involved who owns what who are

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,600
the secondary contacts all that good

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,079
stuff that has to be done beforehand um

418
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
because the longer you wait when when it

419
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,680
eventually does happen

420
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
uh you're not gonna be able to respond

421
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,160
uh in time right you're probably gonna

422
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,399
have a poor poor experience

423
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
and that's why i love that when you're

424
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,079
building things like this and then you

425
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,120
do the exercise you do two things one

426
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
you discover that

427
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,120
you know tony built this and it says

428
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
create fellowship

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,959
and there's two people responsible for

430
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,560
that

431
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
is that legitimate

432
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,199
can two people own the process

433
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,560
i tend to say a racy can only have one r

434
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,360
well frodo was a key contributor to the

435
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
ownership

436
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
in fact some might say he was not the

437
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
most equipped to take the ring on that

438
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,639
and that's why i say you know i think i

439
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,279
think you have it anyway um and so

440
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,000
exercises are are critical to both make

441
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
sure everybody knows who owns it how

442
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
they own it if it's a partnership how

443
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,720
they're going to come to resolution and

444
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
also to set expectations

445
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,720
so

446
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,399
for those of you who have been

447
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
involved in some kind of a major

448
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,160
incident the first thing you get from

449
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,079
the leadership is

450
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,000
what's the status and we want an update

451
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,959
every 30 minutes

452
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,959
and then you turn to your sock analyst

453
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
and you say you go do your work

454
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
and when you have something come tell me

455
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
and i'll update them every 30 minutes

456
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
you don't need to come back to me every

457
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
30 minutes

458
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,440
because guess what how long does it take

459
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
to troubleshoot something

460
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
until you figure out what's wrong

461
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
you know i love those those hypothetical

462
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
questions when are you going to know how

463
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,639
much data was lost

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,559
when i can tell it's not happening

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,760
anymore

466
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,119
and so

467
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,359
building expectations building the team

468
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,599
making sure people know their role i

469
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,480
can't emphasize how important this is

470
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
you know it is it is key especially now

471
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
with the high turnover all of us are

472
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,679
experiencing

473
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
you know how many of us have that that

474
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
one guy who left was the historical

475
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,679
knowledge of all your firewall policies

476
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
you know

477
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,760
so so these exercises are really

478
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
important

479
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,919
so let's take a little journey back in

480
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
time uh even further than this let's go

481
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
back to 2014

482
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
when there was an ssl vulnerability

483
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,000
called heartbleed that was disclosed

484
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
uh and oh yeah we found out that it had

485
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
been actively

486
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
actively exploited in the wild for a

487
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
previous two years to that

488
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,200
right so this was one of my first big

489
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
experiences when i started awkmy

490
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
and to the point of you know who gets

491
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,080
notified before anything was fixed we

492
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
had to make a public press announcement

493
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,760
right because everyone knows there's tls

494
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,320
or ssl certs deployed globally across

495
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
350 000 servers

496
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,120
uh that are oh yeah in front of big

497
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
banks big social media companies big

498
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
commerce platforms

499
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,480
so we probably have to give some kind of

500
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
notification what's going on

501
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
um that that process what what's really

502
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
interesting about this is we learned a

503
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,200
ton of lessons from this uh and we we've

504
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,799
announced this publicly

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,200
um but the initial response was our

506
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
implementation of openssl was not

507
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,679
vulnerable to this exploit and we

508
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,520
started sharing what our implementation

509
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
was uh and then like three days later a

510
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
researcher came back to us and said

511
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
hey you guys are still vulnerable here's

512
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,320
here's a poc of of the exploits still

513
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
working

514
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
so we had like a three or four day

515
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
lack of a head start on going out and

516
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,240
re-keying all of our our certs globally

517
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
that's a huge impact and oh yeah when

518
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,400
you go through that process you really

519
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,039
start to find out man a lot of people

520
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,280
need to touch a lot of systems

521
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
at the same time in order to get this

522
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,640
done expediently

523
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,480
um so it's like hey can you spell

524
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
computer congratulations you're on the

525
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
task force right um so so uh you flash

526
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
forward to the response to log4j

527
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,400
and here we have um what that's i guess

528
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,760
eight eight

529
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
long years after that

530
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
and we started uh

531
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,039
seeing that all the things that we

532
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
learned from those initial

533
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
uh you know heartbleed and then later

534
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
poodle uh we put into action

535
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,480
to have a really proper response for

536
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,240
log4j

537
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,320
one the visibility around you know where

538
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
it exists in your environment that's a

539
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,280
real key issue um but more so you know

540
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,480
we saw

541
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
so much exploitation attempts uh against

542
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
our customer base at one point i think

543
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
60 of our customers were being hit by

544
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
exploitation attempts

545
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
as we started to kind of weed out and we

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,760
started to

547
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
see patches come out then we could start

548
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
doing a reduction of that and say okay

549
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
these are vulnerability scanners that

550
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,840
are testing for the exploit based on

551
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,919
this vulnerability scanner

552
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
code that it had and we can start to

553
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
take that out but this this was a really

554
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,840
massive massive problem

555
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,039
and so

556
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
this is where we've kind of diverted

557
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
from

558
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
our generic example to an example of a

559
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
security vendor so how many of you work

560
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,640
for a security vendor of some flavor

561
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,159
so this is where you're good for you

562
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:42,960
guys

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,240
never change

564
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
so are you protecting yourself

565
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
and simultaneously

566
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,080
looking at your product and how your

567
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
product can protect your customer

568
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
and so what we're talking about here is

569
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,840
what we were seeing hitting our

570
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
our thousands of customers on our web

571
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,120
application firewall and this is where

572
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,039
you really kind of break out

573
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,280
and there's intricacies to this right so

574
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
like we have an adversarial resilience

575
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
team that really looks at how

576
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,840
adversaries might uh and do try to

577
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,520
bypass or do try to bypass

578
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,400
my

579
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
platform security so securing the

580
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
platform means making it continue to run

581
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,000
properly

582
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but then the other side is anything

583
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,720
that's deployed on behalf of a customer

584
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,640
how are those configurations and that

585
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
implementation uh secured separately

586
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
right so again it goes into the the racy

587
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
chart again who's responsible uh who's

588
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
gonna be brought into a task force um

589
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
and uh you know if we go to the next

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,960
slide

591
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
we'll see that uh so the the red graph

592
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,240
here on the right side is uh

593
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
percentage times ten so these are six

594
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
sixty percent at one point sixty percent

595
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
of our customers were being hit

596
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
um by these attacks

597
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,520
and then you'll notice here as well as

598
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,720
new

599
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,960
exploit code is being released

600
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
we saw a huge influx in attacks that

601
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
test out that new exploit code right

602
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,679
because anytime new code is released on

603
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
a zero day there's a race against the

604
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
clock like when is this going to get

605
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
patched if i'm going to exploit it the

606
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,520
time is now so we see like a fevered

607
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
pitch here you'll see around the um

608
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,559
a few days after uh christmas time here

609
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,360
massive massive uh increase in attack

610
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
traffic

611
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
now some of this was attributed to uh

612
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,760
scanning tools that got the previous

613
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
patch uh and then they were testing

614
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
obviously

615
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,280
um but uh but again this is

616
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
uh the interesting case about this again

617
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
that i mentioned is

618
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,240
uh 92 of the attacks that we saw were

619
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,200
being blocked uh far away from where the

620
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
exploit uh was

621
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
was actually vulnerable so this is where

622
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
you come into what what is your model

623
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
for securing your environment

624
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
do you have like virtual patching

625
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,679
capabilities where you're the exploit

626
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,520
may still exist but you're buying time

627
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
by blocking the visibility of that you

628
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
know from your uh from the adversaries

629
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,520
right so

630
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
this again it was a great learning

631
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,919
experience for us

632
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
and one of the key lessons is never let

633
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,480
a good crisis go to waste

634
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
and so

635
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
i want to talk about the three aspects

636
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,760
we have here the first is

637
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,679
protecting our customer

638
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,720
um

639
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
you know on day one

640
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,840
you have to get the message out to

641
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
whoever your partners are whoever your

642
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
customers are if it's internal i.t

643
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,520
if it's if it's making sure your your

644
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
third parties are working on it if

645
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,159
you're supporting customers

646
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
if you're a bank managing wealth you're

647
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,799
notifying people what you're doing so

648
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
you know that educating and getting the

649
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,640
message out that you're on top of this

650
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,080
is critical

651
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,380
um

652
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,520
[Music]

653
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
i find it interesting that

654
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,840
this was a huge chance for people to

655
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,240
re-evaluate the risk they've accepted

656
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,559
how many people have a security control

657
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,840
in monitor mode only

658
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
why

659
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
because

660
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,879
we're worried about the function

661
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
i was going to say be honest

662
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,679
but yeah no need to do that how many

663
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,120
people won't raise your hand no matter

664
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
what i ask

665
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,440
okay good nice psychological warfare i

666
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
like that

667
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,279
so

668
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,600
uh you know this is something that that

669
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,400
is

670
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
is fascinating because when this came

671
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,200
out

672
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
the leadership was now asking are we

673
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,960
blocking this

674
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
not security banking can we please put

675
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
in a blocking rule

676
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
and so they took advantage of it i i saw

677
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,799
some customers

678
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,520
change their entire platform to block

679
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,559
mode

680
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,440
and some customers only block on the

681
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,159
log4j rule

682
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,039
um

683
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
and so there were again this is risk

684
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,039
tolerance it's

685
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
the customer experience security balance

686
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,919
out there

687
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,480
but a lot of lessons learned around this

688
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
is an opportunity to go back to

689
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
leadership and talk about your your

690
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,880
risk appetite which is a

691
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,000
an ffiec banking term going back to

692
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,799
what's your corporate willing to to say

693
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
is the right thing to do hey on that

694
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,640
point will you talk a little bit about

695
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,279
uh you mentioned you know someone's

696
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,039
driving to work as a board member they

697
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:31,840
hear

698
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
hey the latest you know earth-shattering

699
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
vulnerability that you're all gonna die

700
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,720
because of talk a little bit about the

701
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
involvement of the board when things get

702
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,440
to that level how it changes the scope

703
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
of

704
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
uh of how you have to respond to it you

705
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,200
know from a notification perspective

706
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
from uh now they want to be updated

707
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,279
every 10 minutes just like you know your

708
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
boss would normally want to be

709
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,799
what's out of the fight

710
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
so

711
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,200
my experience has been

712
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,880
10 years ago

713
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,840
our boards had more luddites on them

714
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,000
than technically competent people

715
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
if you don't know what a luddite is i'm

716
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,600
going to google that it's worth going to

717
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,440
wikipedia i'm not going to go down that

718
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,679
rabbit trail but it's it's one of my

719
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
favorite derogatory terms

720
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,039
and so

721
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
um

722
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
the

723
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
the thing we've seen is

724
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
how many businesses now

725
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,159
don't have a critical part of the

726
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,240
business that depends on i.t

727
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
it's fewer and fewer every year

728
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
and so boards are now talking about the

729
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
business strategy

730
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,799
in terms of technology capabilities

731
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,240
and so we're seeing more of them

732
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
educated

733
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
more of them they've always talked about

734
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
risk

735
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,880
they've never talked about technologies

736
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
and so the board doesn't want to know

737
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,200
what log4j does

738
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,799
they don't want to know what open source

739
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,159
is

740
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,159
they don't

741
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
you are not a technology advisor you're

742
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,559
a business partner

743
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,960
and if you go up as a ciso as a

744
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,600
technology advisor you're you're not

745
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
going to knock it out of the park and so

746
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,960
you're going to go up there and you're

747
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
going to talk about risk and on day one

748
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,840
you're going to say

749
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
right now

750
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,520
we have risk around customer data

751
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,760
in these three places

752
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
and we put a a

753
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
a segmentation policy we have additional

754
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
monitoring

755
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,720
we

756
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,919
uh have an immediate patch process once

757
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,440
a patch comes out

758
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
we've implemented a waf or whatever you

759
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,679
know this is if it's solar wind it's a

760
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,039
product then you know there's a

761
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,720
different set of

762
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
what you have to do are you going to

763
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
uninstall it what's the impact of the

764
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
business

765
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,679
again rabbit trails i won't go down

766
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,320
um but it's going up and talking about

767
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,799
the impacts and the risk to to your

768
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
business

769
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
and if you go back 10 years 10 15 years

770
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
uh how many

771
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
how many companies didn't rely solely on

772
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
the internet to do their business

773
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,840
um so whereas you might be able to say

774
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,640
just say you're in secops or you're in

775
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,159
incident response

776
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,200
um

777
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,159
and

778
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,799
there's an infrastructure problem it's

779
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,880
so easy to kind of pass that over and

780
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,240
say oh that's a

781
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
that's a

782
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,000
you know a platform issue or that's the

783
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
cloud people that have to worry about

784
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
that or that's a

785
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,679
uh you know or there's some kind of if

786
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,279
there's an internet outage if there's

787
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,120
anything that could affect your company

788
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
making money trust me anyone who could

789
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
possibly fix it is going to be in scope

790
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,200
for you know

791
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,000
a resume writing opportunity right so

792
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
the whole idea here is as more

793
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,880
organizations are relying on the

794
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
software stack the internet stack

795
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,480
to to viably have their business

796
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
function

797
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,679
um it changes the conversation it

798
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
changes the education of the board uh a

799
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,679
lot of the board now are a lot more

800
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,720
technology savvy worse versus you know

801
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,880
10 15 years ago they were just kind of

802
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
pure play business people advising on

803
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
the next strategic step to take

804
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,159
uh so i think that's an interesting

805
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
change too uh and and we should be

806
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,559
cognizant of that when it comes to

807
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,919
how we deal

808
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,840
uh with our superiors up the chain

809
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
because you have to you have to

810
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,600
understand where they're coming from too

811
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,880
and you probably haven't heard of this

812
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,399
organization so you may want to write

813
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,679
this down but there are a lot of

814
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,080
industry ice acts out there never heard

815
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
of it

816
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,640
and that's his favorite topic um and so

817
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,159
that's another thing that you've got to

818
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,320
decide to put in your process

819
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
when you have these are you going to

820
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
call in and see if there's an isac call

821
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
fsi sac healthcare ice hospitality

822
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,600
retail

823
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,919
at one point there were 15 major ice

824
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,600
sacks i i think there's more than that

825
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
now yeah i think there's like 24 now or

826
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
something like that it's pretty

827
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
pervasive but where are you going to go

828
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
to your your peer group

829
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,880
what communities are you going to reach

830
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
out what external resources are you

831
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,559
going to leverage and there's a bunch of

832
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,159
them out there

833
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
dhs is going to put something out there

834
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,320
about a week after you need it

835
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,279
um

836
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,720
but again no offense dhs no offense is

837
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,559
what i meant to say

838
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,679
and so

839
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,640
um

840
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
you know but i will tell you why it's

841
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,559
worth going and looking at that is it's

842
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,440
a great

843
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,840
lessons learned it's a great checklist

844
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
to see what you did and what other

845
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,919
people did the last thing is expanding

846
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,000
our tool kit

847
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,520
for each one of these there are

848
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
different remediation or mitigation

849
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
techniques out there and so kind of

850
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,039
think through that that first set we

851
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,640
went through

852
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,840
what tools do you have in your tool kit

853
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,880
and which where do you have gaps

854
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,039
you know we we talk about segmentation

855
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,120
we talk about access control we talk

856
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,000
about

857
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,279
you know if you're in your ap

858
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,039
environment api environment what what

859
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,200
are the different tools you have or

860
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,039
levers to pull during these incidents

861
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,919
so again

862
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,919
i want to talk a little bit about you

863
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
know what is the next step what should

864
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,279
we be doing and um

865
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
i've really tried to make a case here

866
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,679
that we should shift off of

867
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,840
thinking about a zero day as an incident

868
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,919
a sock-owned

869
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,080
problem

870
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,960
and expand this to be what it needs to

871
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,919
be

872
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,240
you know a communication exercise

873
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,760
a racy with i.t

874
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,919
vendor management

875
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
forensic the pen test team going out and

876
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
pr even

877
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,279
public relations even if you have to

878
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,600
give incident response

879
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,039
or no notification that hey you are

880
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,200
looking at this or maybe because of the

881
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
vulnerability we had to take systems

882
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,799
offline for patching

883
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,360
uh all of that has to be in scope

884
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,279
absolutely and so um you know

885
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,039
if you don't have a crisis management

886
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,679
prop process you can go leverage

887
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
that we need to have another discussion

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,919
but for those of you who do

889
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,159
i think this is a great

890
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,279
um

891
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,240
i'm a huge advocate of nist

892
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,799
uh simply because nist is

893
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,720
something that you can show the auditors

894
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
is a best practice

895
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,360
so you know something like

896
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,960
um

897
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,559
know moving missed 190 i think is for

898
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,720
apis i think we have

899
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,679
uh

900
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,679
miss 207 for

901
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,279
um

902
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,799
so trust

903
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,640
you know there are a lot of special pubs

904
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
out there that you should be going

905
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
pulling verbiage from best practices

906
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,880
from

907
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,799
and crisis management well and don't

908
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,559
forget that first incident response

909
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,159
cycle i showed you

910
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,159
is from nist as well

911
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,679
and that's more the transitional 853.

912
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,559
um

913
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,840
so go out there build the documentation

914
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,000
exercise practices

915
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
i know you wanted to talk about that as

916
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,720
well

917
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,919
um

918
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,279
and and cover a little bit about the

919
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,159
s-bombs and the vendor management there

920
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,000
yeah you know we talked earlier about

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,760
the idea of uh

922
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,399
um an s-bomb right so what software

923
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,919
exists in your environment

924
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,120
uh whether or not it's your

925
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,559
responsibility to patch it um i mean

926
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,880
years ago i used to use tools like

927
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,679
secunia which are agent-based tools that

928
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
will install and basically map out all

929
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,519
the software that's installed on that

930
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,480
system

931
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,799
and then compare it to the latest patch

932
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,080
update for each of those different

933
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,600
software packages

934
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,679
um things like that exist now i know

935
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,120
they got bought out they're doing

936
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,840
similar work though uh but the idea here

937
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
is

938
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,519
um

939
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,279
if something exists in your environment

940
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
eventually it can come back and bite you

941
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,159
because you know who's going to be

942
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,279
looking for

943
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,159
your

944
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,679
you know uh your 20 year old uh you know

945
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,960
software version of uh whatever package

946
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
you're using on one of your old web

947
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,560
servers the bad guys the bad guys are

948
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,399
going to be looking for that

949
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,239
and it's not just by happenstance it's

950
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
the path of least resistance

951
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,320
i don't have to use a zero day if

952
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
there's a

953
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
seven year day out there that hasn't

954
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,520
been patched yet because you haven't

955
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,839
gotten around to it

956
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
so that's that's one of the big pieces

957
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,918
and again to the whole point of of

958
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
walking through this and practicing it

959
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,239
i can't stress that part enough

960
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,960
um pretend like you

961
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,719
are going back through heartbleed say

962
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,918
what is it going to take for us to

963
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,199
re-key

964
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,000
all the um the private certs

965
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
uh

966
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,879
and then redeploy

967
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,719
um you know the search to our other

968
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,160
machines what's that going to take who's

969
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,880
going to be involved just practice that

970
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,520
and without going through a process like

971
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
that if something like that were to

972
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
happen again

973
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
um you're gonna be starting from square

974
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
one uh and that's what we're trying to

975
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,640
avoid here we we do a lot of this when

976
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,480
we work with our customers

977
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,599
um and our clients just because if

978
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,040
something were to happen we don't want

979
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
to be the ones who are in the way of

980
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,640
them getting their problems fixed even

981
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
if it's nothing to do with us

982
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,880
uh so we're trying to help

983
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,440
kind of grease the skids so to speak of

984
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,119
those things working better within our

985
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,960
customer base so if something does

986
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
happen again we're not the we're not the

987
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,480
roadblock

988
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
yeah and so again going back to that

989
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
first slide

990
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,280
the different categories that you should

991
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
do exercises around

992
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,040
uh and then there are different types of

993
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,480
exercise there's a this typical tabletop

994
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,320
where you're you can just sit down with

995
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,400
the racy and talk through the race

996
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,520
and you should have a timeline in steps

997
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,760
notification discovery patch release

998
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,440
you know you'll have some key milestones

999
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,560
in your exercise for each of these

1000
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,799
and

1001
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
some of these will involve leadership

1002
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
some of these will be more technical in

1003
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,359
nature

1004
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,839
so so think about the kind of exercises

1005
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,119
you want

1006
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,640
i think they're all beneficial

1007
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,480
so we put up some resources here one

1008
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
arthrit research group

1009
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
has a bunch of great publications uh

1010
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
i was just talking at uh at the other

1011
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
conference across the road about our

1012
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
gaming state of the internet security

1013
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,520
report so cool findings that we found

1014
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
basically if you own a gaming system or

1015
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,960
if you've been uh during the

1016
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,119
stay-at-home order i like to call the

1017
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,599
stay-at-home and game order because as a

1018
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,760
gamer it's like you mean i get to be at

1019
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
home all the time and if i'm on a boring

1020
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,320
call i can be on a oh is this being

1021
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
recorded

1022
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,119
um i can be playing something right so

1023
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,599
uh also i have add so i work better with

1024
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,560
that kind of distraction in the

1025
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,400
background um

1026
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,119
our security blogs uh again a bunch of

1027
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,800
cool stuff here just around things that

1028
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
we're finding

1029
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
um we have a security researcher named

1030
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,760
larry cash dollar he has something like

1031
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,480
350 cve say his name we call him the

1032
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
wordpress killer although he has

1033
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
recently kind of branched off from

1034
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
wordpress

1035
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
um and on youtube we have some developer

1036
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,000
videos

1037
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
uh a lot of these are developer kind of

1038
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,040
advocacy videos talking about how you

1039
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,960
guys as security personnel can interface

1040
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,359
with your development teams better

1041
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,599
and again how we try to do that within

1042
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
our organization as well

1043
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
and then the last piece is we are hiring

1044
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,320
so if you guys think it'd be cool to

1045
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,240
work for a multinational

1046
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,640
cloud security organization uh we do

1047
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,320
really cool stuff i've been at october

1048
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,720
we hired just about anybody that's

1049
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,520
that's true i i snuck in um but i've

1050
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
been to document for nine years uh it's

1051
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,640
the first time i've ever worked for

1052
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,599
vendor

1053
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,680
uh but i've been in secops since the

1054
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,079
late 90s so it's really been eye-opening

1055
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,240
kind of seeing all the cool stuff that a

1056
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,720
company like like us are doing

1057
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,119
um so that's smart i would also say uh

1058
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
the blogs a lot of the stuff we talked

1059
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,520
about for log4j you'll see in our blogs

1060
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,960
a lot of the charts

1061
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,680
tom evans is great about ddos

1062
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,640
or is great about fishing we've got

1063
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,200
i'm really proud of some of our research

1064
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,480
all right

1065
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
who's going to who's going to stump us

1066
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,920
now's the time

1067
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,119
we don't have to go there you don't have

1068
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,119
to stump us but um

1069
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,480
if you use the microphone it'll be

1070
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
recorded for the uh for the people at

1071
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,359
home as well

1072
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
okay really important one

1073
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,760
thanks for this this is great

1074
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040

1079
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,599

1080
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,800

um

1085
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,040
that's that's a tough one

1086
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,119
i i should have we should have put a

1087
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,960
caveat that said he's better with lines

1088
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,200
i'll give you that any movie that is

1089
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,760
from the

1090
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,200
what

1091
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,520
no go ahead b all right dude it's too

1092
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,200
late for the caveats

1093
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,560
okay

1094
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
i know one you can answer yeah yeah so

1095
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,680
um

1096
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,920
the pr part you touched on is really

1097
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,800
essential i i think that when a breach

1098
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,079
happens

1099
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,280
um

1100
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,720
eventually your tech guys are going to

1101
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,760
figure it out but if you botch the pr

1102
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,359
your rep is screwed for a long long

1103
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,480
time

1104
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
um if you're a smaller group and you

1105
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
don't really have people that are

1106
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,119
specialized in that area how do you

1107
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,800
handle that

1108
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,720
that's a great point so i will go back

1109
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,920
to my first hand experience in 2014

1110
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,319
um with heartbleed we put together a

1111
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,119
group

1112
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,400
which was our pr ar team

1113
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
uh our platform security

1114
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,319
architects

1115
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,480
some other kind of security evangelist

1116
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,440
type

1117
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
people

1118
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,720
and

1119
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,319
our cso

1120
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,560
and we all kind of work through

1121
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
literally like the wording of what this

1122
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,560
press release was going to look like

1123
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,400
uh what we were going to say sometimes

1124
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,119
you can't say too much exactly uh but

1125
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,880
sometimes if you don't say enough it's

1126
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,760
like

1127
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,640
are you

1128
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,520
are you giving proper warning to someone

1129
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,119
else who may need to take care of this

1130
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,280
right so that's a it's a very fine

1131
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,960
balance and i think ultimately depending

1132
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,839
on

1133
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,839
um what organization you're a part of

1134
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,599
and what your responsibilities are

1135
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,880
there's legal

1136
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
responsibilities but also ethical

1137
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
responsibilities i think all that has to

1138
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
be taken into account so

1139
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
it is steve i don't know if you have a

1140
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,480
more specific answer but

1141
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,599
so i mean um

1142
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,560
transparency equals trust and loss of

1143
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,599
trust is hard to recover from

1144
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,079
that said

1145
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,119
i think about two things during like

1146
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,800
during a breach i have a person assigned

1147
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,160
who's going to tell me if i'm not

1148
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
following our process

1149
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,960
because if i don't follow our process

1150
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
and they just the class action lawsuit

1151
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,800
discovers that

1152
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
i'm going to be sued for negligence

1153
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,520
i have my chief legal officer my general

1154
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,480
counsel hire my forensic people

1155
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,440
so the forensic evidence is under

1156
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
attorney-client privilege

1157
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,680
so i mean that's how i'm thinking at the

1158
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,520
same time

1159
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,759
when i'm talking to the board i'm saying

1160
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,960
where we don't have enough to say if we

1161
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,960
say we lost 3 000 records today

1162
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,079
i'm we may come back tomorrow and say oh

1163
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,119
make that 1.5 million

1164
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,800
yeah big difference so it doesn't sound

1165
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,040
transparent to say we're still trying to

1166
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,520
figure out what's going on not

1167
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
hard to get the the marketing and pr

1168
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,160
people to sign off on that statement so

1169
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,640
it's a delicate balance

1170
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,480
i would lean into a culture of

1171
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,079
transparency

1172
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,560
uh and and talk to legal and talk to pr

1173
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,160
about

1174
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,200
sharing upfront

1175
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,119
yeah thanks for that i

1176
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,720
what i'm seeing

1177
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,440
in general is people weighing

1178
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,720
cya

1179
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,839
against

1180
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,720
yes

1181
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
what is the damage

1182
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,359
right so that seems dangerous if there's

1183
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,880
like a framework

1184
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,960
that really makes it clear this is your

1185
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,280
legal obligation

1186
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,800
to disclose

1187
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,160
this portion

1188
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,359
versus

1189
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,599
you know what i'm saying yeah yeah and i

1190
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,800
think they've attempted to create

1191
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,640
frameworks around

1192
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
um

1193
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,440
you know one from a vulnerability

1194
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,280
perspective if you have any risk

1195
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,359
involved there responsible disclosure

1196
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,440
uh and then also breach this disclosure

1197
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,920
is being handled a lot more

1198
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,000
from the compliance level where they're

1199
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,079
like hey these this is what you have to

1200
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,240
do if something were to occur uh as per

1201
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
the the compliance that you've

1202
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,560
you know opted into that you've uh

1203
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,880
agreed to right so there's also some

1204
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,440
psychology around admitting mistakes

1205
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,960
um

1206
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,359
the the classic example that i always

1207
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,000
remember is warren buffett every year

1208
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,240
puts a mistake he made in his

1209
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,480
annual report

1210
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
because he has so much more credibility

1211
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
by doing that and the one year he didn't

1212
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,480
feel like he had a good

1213
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,760
oops

1214
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,280
he talked about the oops from the year

1215
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,240
before

1216
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
yeah um so they're they're again

1217
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,920
transparency generally wins

1218
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,960
uh

1219
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,200
and it also goes back to how negligent

1220
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,640
you were

1221
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,800
uh in the first place

1222
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,760
thank you

1223
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
thank you thanks for the question

1224
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,440

1225
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,599
technical serving very technical

1226
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,599
customers who are serving their very

1227
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,160
large very technical companies i work at

1228
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,880
a startup and i've got three engineers

1229
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,319
i'm in qa by the way i'm not even a

1230
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,599
security person thank you for your

1231
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,440
service i tried

1232
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,319
um

1233
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,800
are there resources on your blogs for

1234
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,079
how to get the rest of your

1235
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,800
non-technical team on board with these

1236
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,599
ideas with these for lack of a better

1237
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,680
term war games about like how do we

1238
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,760
bring everybody into these because i

1239
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,520
used to work in support so i'm really

1240
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,599
good at writing effective apologies and

1241
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,520
emails that don't get us in legal

1242
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,839
trouble there's a lot of resources

1243
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,160
outside of just the technical parts that

1244
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,599
can be looped in here and be really

1245
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,800
helpful for cya for making the apologies

1246
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,200
for doing the press releases do have

1247
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,000
more resources for how i can

1248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,040
get my marketing team interested in this

1249
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,760
for what happens if hubspot goes down

1250
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
and planning for what happens right yeah

1251
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,520
yeah

1252
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,400
um

1253
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,000
do you want to take a several

1254
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,599
so um

1255
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,160
there are first of all there are great

1256
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,720
industry specific podcast

1257
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,560
uh and and one of the things i like to

1258
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,480
do is figure out how like somebody how

1259
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,920
somebody likes to learn i prefer to read

1260
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,280
uh my add makes audio books

1261
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,720
impractical

1262
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,440
what was that and then um

1263
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,599
you know other people

1264
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,119
have different methods so

1265
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,800
find out what they like

1266
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,440
sans has a lot of great examples

1267
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,560
uh they're great to plagiarize from uh

1268
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,599
youtube has a lot of great resources

1269
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,880
um

1270
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
like i said i plagiarize a lot from nist

1271
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,280
uh iso is a cost so i i don't

1272
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,440
if you're international you want iso

1273
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,839
over nist but it's not free

1274
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,040
um

1275
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,920
and again belonging to community

1276
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
uh there are so many communities out

1277
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
there beyond the ice ax

1278
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,839
that uh the more people you can plug

1279
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,599
into them but um you know like i said

1280
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,319
for your marketing if this is hilarious

1281
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,599
so i was

1282
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,880
i was talking to the marketers and

1283
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,640
they're like the the book influence is

1284
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,240
great we use it and then i'm talking to

1285
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,160
my fraud expert me and i were doing a

1286
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,720
talk together and he's like well all the

1287
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
fraudsters know that the book influences

1288
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,319
the best book to learn how to be a good

1289
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,599
fraudster

1290
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,960
and so

1291
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
you know that's everybody yeah yeah

1292
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,680
that's that's a resource that uh that

1293
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,440
went right to this top of my reading

1294
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
list well i think the uh the point too

1295
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,560
about uh join a community

1296
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,400
another good piece of advice might be

1297
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,760
build a community within your

1298
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,040
organization

1299
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,560
say hey i really want us to be prepared

1300
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,119
for what happens if something

1301
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,520
catastrophic were to happen

1302
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,359
uh find stakeholders within each

1303
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,520
different part of the organization and

1304
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,680
all have lunch together one day and then

1305
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,760
maybe the next time you say or at the

1306
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,839
lunch maybe say hey it'd be great for us

1307
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,839
to have like a monthly meeting

1308
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
just to kind of talk about

1309
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,640
all the pieces that fit into this

1310
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,160
and then maybe from that you guys can

1311
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,119
start assigning

1312
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,640
responsibilities or areas of expertise

1313
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,800
even a lot of times people's areas of

1314
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,319
expertise is not the role that they're

1315
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,839
currently working in

1316
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,359
uh i worked for years at a company where

1317
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,240
i was like to do everything person

1318
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,839
and it turns out

1319
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,720
you know

1320
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,800
i would rather do less

1321
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,760
so

1322
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,160
uh for from that perspective

1323
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,000
not just less i would rather not have to

1324
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,760
do everything the hard way

1325
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
um i want to automate myself out of a

1326
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,200
job kind of situation right so um but i

1327
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,720
would say build a community within your

1328
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,079
organization

1329
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,079
uh of people who are like-minded that

1330
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,520
that think it might be a risk if

1331
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,280
something were to happen and how are you

1332

1342
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,280
am an excellent driver

1343
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,680
i'm an excellent driver

1344
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,200
excellent driver

1345
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
yes well now this is like really putting

1346
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
me on the spot

1347
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,280
that is 80s

1348
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,280
is that um

1349
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
weird science

1350
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,280
it's not

1351
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,520
okay

1352
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,680
all right what you got it

1353
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,559
okay

1354
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,240
i don't want you to stump me and get the

1355
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,000
one that she

1356
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,040
could anybody else know it

1357
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,280
oh yes

1358
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,119
okay to be honest

1359
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,559
i probably should have put some caveats

1360
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,559
at the beginning of that well this whole

1361
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,640
talk has been for naught

1362
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,960
uh anyway if there's no other questions

1363
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
anybody else have anything else

1364
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,400
all right thank you guys for being here

1365
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200

1366
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,310
