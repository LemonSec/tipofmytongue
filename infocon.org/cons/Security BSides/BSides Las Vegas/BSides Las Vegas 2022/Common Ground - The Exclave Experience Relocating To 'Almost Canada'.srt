1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,179
I'm Chief profit and I did something a

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:06,000
little bit crazy and I think that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,740
probably I shouldn't be the only person

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,139
to do the same crazy things so that's

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,280
what I'm going to share with everybody

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,240
today uh why you should move to an

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,100
exclave and we'll see if my clicker

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,119
works

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,580
does it work is it working

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,359
Yes No Maybe

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,099
clicker's not working oh well

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,820
so uh this is the house that I used to

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,880
live in and it's in a gritty industrial

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
suburb of Seattle called Renton uh if

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,940
you've flown on a Boeing 737 it was

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,860
built in this town There's a big Boeing

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,840
factory and the other thing that it's

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,440
best known for is a very noisy chunk of

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,579
well-used 405 freeway called uh the

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,820
Renton S curves which I lived just above

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,539
and so in 2020 I was living in a

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,000
thousand square feet of house uh working

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
from home

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,860
I had a view of the freeway all day and

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,320
you know the house was built in 1943 it

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,659
was never built very well because it was

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,880
built for Boeing workers during the war

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,920
and it was intended to be temporary

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,500
housing and then it just kind of ended

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,720
up being you know multi-generational

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,860
home

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,619
and the thing always needed work and it

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,119
was drafty in the winter and I just

34
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,799
wasn't really happy living there is

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,479
especially in the middle of a pandemic

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,400
because you know the walls kind of close

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
in on you when you're living in a

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
pandemic right we all experience that

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,659
so

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,619
um

41
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,860
one day I asked myself just what in the

42
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,740
heck am I doing with my life and I work

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,200
remote I can live anywhere that I want

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
to in the U.S I could live in other

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,119
countries even I could even live in

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,259
really unusual or remote places and

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,659
you know I kind of weighed moving some

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,579
of the places that I'd always dreamed

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,899
about because we always dream about

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,939
maybe living in a tropical Paradise in

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,520
Hawaii or something along those lines

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,500
but that's not very practical for me my

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,300
family lives in the Seattle area and I

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,060
like to travel and I like the amenities

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,160
of a city honestly

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,599
um so

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
given all of that what should I do

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,800
and what I ended up doing is remembering

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,560
that this little corner that's circled

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,840
in red exists it's in the Lower Mainland

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,940
area which is the Greater Vancouver BC

62
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,879
area but it hangs just underneath the

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,459
Border when they drew the border the

64
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,860
49th parallel is is how it was

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,620
demarcated between the United States and

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,319
the British territories which are now

67
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,440
known as Canada and this little five

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,560
square mile chunk was left hanging down

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,920
there and I went and started looking at

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,440
real estate

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,180
and honestly this place is one of the

72
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,220
most unusual and beautiful places in the

73
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,780
world the sunsets really do look like

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
this there's no filter on this at all I

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,180
just took that on my cell phone and um

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,159
you get to to experience that almost

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,200
every day it's really clear because it's

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,659
in a rain shadow highly unusual for the

79
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,640
Pacific Northwest

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,840
and

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,900
if you work with me you you'll know this

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,300
I literally joined my meetings from the

83
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
beach because there's four wonderful

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,659
Beach Parks so I can just basically walk

85
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,700
from my house taking my meetings

86
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,340
remotely and hang out on the beach while

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,379
I do this I mean your company culture

88
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,940
may vary you might not be allowed to

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,980
work remotely or you know your

90
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,599
co-workers might be jealous if you check

91
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,659
in from the beach nobody Minds I get to

92
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,459
do that that's just kind of what I like

93
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,799
to do

94
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,680
Canada is literally across the street if

95
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,879
you look at the picture on the left

96
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,159
that's looking from the Canadian side

97
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,220
into the United States oh my goodness

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,980
now that better not be a Laphroaig 25

99
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,899
bottle with malort inside

100
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,070
you guys really got me that

101
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,080
[Music]

102

not everything yeah I mean like I'll

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,860

104
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,659

105
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,199

106

those of you who don't know this uh you

107
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,759
can make as a speaker what they call an

108
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,860
outrageous request and so I made an

109
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,020
absolutely outrageous request for a

110
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,780
bottle of Laphroaig 25. now that bottle

111
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,080
of Scotch if if there really is laphroyd

112
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,460
25 inside it is a 550 bottle of scotch

113
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,740
and in no way did I expect b-sides to

114
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,300
honor that you know it was just a

115
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,220
completely flipping it was they said

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,000
outrageous request it was outrageous so

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,240
um and a bottle of this has just showed

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,060
up and I insist like I do do you drink

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,620
I don't know if any of you drink Scotch

128
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,780

one of the Holy Grails cheers

130
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,940
wow

131
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,740
okay so this is something that I can't

132
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,360
take to Canada

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,220
because I'd have to pay Duty and we'll

134
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,479
talk about that a little bit later in

135
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,780
the presentation but

136
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,000
uh Canada as I was saying is across the

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,319
street now on the left that's looking

138
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,419
from the Canadian side into Point

139
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,020
Roberts uh there's just a white sign

140
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,880
that says hey this is the us if you walk

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,220
across here you might get in trouble uh

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,080
the other the middle picture is looking

143
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
at the exact same spot from the U.S side

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,460
and then all the way on the right Canada

145
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,740
is literally across the street this is

146
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,620
around 900 meters from my house uh the

147
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,360
houses on the right side of the street

148
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,120
are in Canada the road itself and the

149
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,620
houses on the left side are in the

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,940
United States and that's basically what

151
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,639
the Border looks like so very different

152
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,039
experience than the US's Southern border

153
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
and they keep trying this and see if it

154
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,419
does anything it it doesn't

155
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,580
but the cheapest clicker on Amazon and

156
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,280
sometimes it works uh so low housing

157
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,380
costs I'm totally doxing myself here

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,060
I've never given a talk with my real

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,580
name in it uh and now you're looking at

160
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,500
a picture on my house that's uh where I

161
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
live on the left hand side it's

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,720
literally a million dollars less than

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,880
Canada than in Canada to buy a home on

164
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,340
Point Roberts and this is why I was able

165
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,960
to do it I mean Vancouver is one of the

166
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,460
world's most expensive cities for

167
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,199
housing I think that only Hong Kong is

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,680
more expensive and I was able to get

169
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,120
into a almost brand new 2017 boat uh

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,860
four bedroom home that's 1900 square

171
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,300
feet for uh 4.99 and at the rate that I

172
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,639
financed at that translates to a housing

173
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,099
payment of around 1900 a month which is

174
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,960
less than a one bedroom apartment in San

175
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,259
Francisco so and actually less than a

176
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,120
one bedroom apartment in many parts of

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,500
Seattle

178
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
so if you look at the right that's a

179
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,720
scream cap from Zillow and it just shows

180
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
the property evaluations

181
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,280
the picture that I showed in the past in

182
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,740
the last image where you saw Canada

183
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,599
across the street from the US this is

184
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,319
this is an aerial view of that and what

185
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,720
you can see is that the numbers on the

186
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
Canadian side are roughly a million

187
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,020
dollars more

188
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,900
for almost exactly the same house on one

189
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,080
side of the Border versus the other so

190
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,780
it really is kind of a total hack and

191
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,520
most importantly Jimbo made in Bower

192
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,319
meows are the first proofs of the

193
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,120
additional space so we were living on

194
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,860
top of each other he's a very active

195
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,660
two-year-old cat who loves to play and

196
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,580
run around and now he has two floors to

197
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,400
do it so uh when people say did you buy

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,800
the house for your cat I'm like hmm I

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,979
don't know for I guess for both of us I

200
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,860
do spoil them way too much

201
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,379
uh there's so you might wonder about

202
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,300
taxes you know what's the tax situation

203
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,639
if you're right next to Canada well the

204
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,740
tax situation is exactly the same as if

205
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,880
you're in Washington state because

206
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
that's where you are

207
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
so it's legally the United States

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,580
anybody can move there if you have the

209
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,760
right to live in the U.S uh with an

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,260
asterisk next to it and I'll get to that

211
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,640
later

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,440
um so there's no immigration formalities

213
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,959
at all it's legally the United States so

214
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,480
U.S taxes apply if you are working for a

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,300
U.S company if you can work remotely the

216
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,220
you know whatever tax rate you're paying

217
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,260
you would pay in Washington state that's

218
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,839
basically going to be what you will pay

219
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,600
uh in Point Roberts there is no state

220
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,580
income tax in Washington so that's

221
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,160
pretty awesome Whatcom County has lower

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
property taxes than Central Puget Sound

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
so if you're used to if you're from the

224
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
Seattle area or if you've been looking

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,660
at the Seattle area as a potential place

226
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,060
to move to if if you're in the Bay Area

227
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,700
or La kind of hoping to get away from

228
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,680
the high tax high taxes in California

229
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,019
but still be on the west coast you're

230
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,600
going to be way lower in property taxes

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
living a little bit farther north car

232
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,339
Tabs are hundreds of dollars less

233
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,140
expensive and you know honestly I feel

234
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,640
like I'm getting away with something by

235
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,980
living there

236
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,140
just financially it works out so much

237
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,360
better and

238
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,240
Point Roberts itself is very stable and

239
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,300
secure and so uh that is a bit of a

240
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,279
concern who has concerns over the

241
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,800
current state of stability of the United

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,380
States right now anybody given what's

243
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,779
been going on politically I mean you

244
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,820
know some of us feel freely secure where

245
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,100
we are I'm I've been all over the world

246
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,320
76 countries and territories and

247
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
counting all seven continents and I know

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,820
where things end up when they continue

249
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,700
on the trajectory they have and it turns

250
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,740
into a lot of dysfunction you know stuff

251
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,920
like the power not staying on and water

252
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,360
not being drinkable and that kind of

253
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,980
thing so

254
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,700
um

255
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,579
for me the fact that the power is

256
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:26,279
provided by BC Hydro and marketed by

257
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,980
Puget Sound Energy is a plus because I

258
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,380
feel like the their ability to deliver

259
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,480
reliable infrastructure over time is

260
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,740
likely to be better

261
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,079
the water comes from the city of

262
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,060
Vancouver it's marketed by a local water

263
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,720
district but it's good quality water and

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
it's run by the city of Vancouver where

265
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,040
I expect that that Supply to continue

266
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
and be reliable it's very very difficult

267
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,440
for anybody with a criminal record to

268
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
access point Roberts and so that's the

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
thing to keep in mind is you know even

270
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
if you've got a DUI

271
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,060
that is something that is a really big

272
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,120
problem to get through Canada so the

273
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,640
other thing that I think is an upside or

274
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,019
a downside depending on whether you like

275
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,360
guns I personally don't I want nothing

276
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,740
to do with them and I don't want to own

277
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,019
any and I don't like being around them

278
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,720
now we all have different opinions on

279
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,420
guns but the discharge of a firearm is

280
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,300
illegal on Point Roberts there is no

281
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
federal firearms dealer so there's no

282
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,660
way to get you know any really high

283
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,839
powered weapons over there and

284
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,279
um

285
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
you could really only bring them in on a

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,339
boat but then you're not allowed to

287
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,279
shoot them so it's it works out pretty

288
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,260
well because the Canadians just don't

289
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,640
want to have a whole lot of guns right

290
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,700
next to their border uh so it and most

291
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,140
people on Point Roberts just really

292
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,660
don't want a lot of gun activity so

293
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,279
effectively they're illegal

294
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
unfortunately so is marijuana so even

295
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
though it's legal on both sides of the

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,339
Border in Washington state and in BC

297
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,680
it's federally illegal in both countries

298
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,959
to bring marijuana across a border so

299
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,380
it's until that stupidity ends no weed

300
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,260
you can do CBD products and some of

301
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,079
those are Delta IX and Edibles so if you

302
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,940
enjoy the experience of cannabis there's

303
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,380
ways to get get it legally but the uh

304
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,880
dispensaries that you can go to in

305
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,260
Washington there just aren't any on

306
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,360
Point Roberts uh licensing is too

307
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,639
complicated and expensive it's too small

308
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,700
a population to make it economic and one

309
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,500
thing with the security that I think is

310
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,540
pretty awesome is it's so secure that

311
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
it's rumored that the federal witness

312
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,220
protection program shelters their most

313
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,579
critical protectees in Point Roberts as

314
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,079
well as you know some other locations

315
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,180
around the country of course I don't

316
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,279
have any direct knowledge of this uh

317
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,500
it's a it would be allegedly in a very

318
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,680
well secured location but that gives you

319
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,440
an idea of the level of security of this

320
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
place right it's uh I think it's

321
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,220
probably one of the most secure

322
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,560
communities in the US

323
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,040
and it's even YouTube famous there's if

324
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,540
you search for Point Roberts on YouTube

325
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,459
you'll find a couple of videos uh one

326
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,839
says that we're going to be sold to

327
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,360
Canada there's this uh Russian YouTuber

328
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,980
who lives in Vancouver and and did uh

329
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,440
semi-accurate uh video on on the place

330
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,899
but uh it's you know it's starting to

331
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,060
get some attention as well but what

332
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,560
about the Border everybody asks about

333
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,420
this because you know Crossing Borders

334
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,000
is stressful and what's it like to live

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,459
in a place where if you want to go over

336
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,680
the mainland of the US you're Crossing

337
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,800
four borders uh that's real

338
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,360
um and you know this place that's that's

339
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,639
our entry point and I'm there a lot

340
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,339
uh well we all cross the border a lot

341
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,620
and the Border guards are people that we

342
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,899
get to know they're all humans and they

343
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,320
know us and so it's routine and it's

344
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,740
usually fast once you for one know and

345
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,420
follow the rules because if you're not

346
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,100
following roles that's going to get you

347
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,720
on the list of people that they look

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,279
more closely at and that's not something

349
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,860
you want so you do pay attention to the

350
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,839
rules present yourself as somebody who

351
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,779
wants to follow them and intends to do

352
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,680
so and you will generally have a very

353
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,019
smooth experience both Canada and the US

354
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,639
maintain border crossings at Point

355
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,060
Roberts not all the exclaves do there's

356
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,779
not a formal border crossing at the

357
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,480
Northwest angle in Minnesota you have to

358
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,779
call in by video in both directions and

359
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,300
in Hyder Alaska which is one of the

360
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,339
other us exclaves there's just no border

361
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,500
checks at all going into the U.S there's

362
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,480
there is a border check going from Beast

363
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,079
back into BC from the Alaska side

364
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,120
uh and that's good for us because it

365
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,519
means that point Roberts is considered

366
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,800
the United States so you can order any

367
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,360
of your online shopping and it's not

368
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,940
subject to any sort of Canada Customs uh

369
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,860
you know it gets kind of complicated and

370
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,440
and also uh gas is sold at the same

371
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,959
price as as it is in the U.S if we

372
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,940
didn't have that border then probably

373
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,060
the US and Canada would have to agree

374
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,500
that point Roberts would be part of the

375
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,240
Canadian custom Zone and so we'd be

376
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,760
paying Canadian taxes for everything and

377
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
that is kind of the deal that Hyder

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
Alaska has but there's hardly anything

379
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,279
in Hyder so it works for them

380
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,920
uh if you're gonna go to the mainland us

381
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,779
as I mentioned before you're Crossing

382
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,760
into Canada driving across it and then

383
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,519
back into the U.S and so this means uh

384
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,899
that there are some border formalities

385
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,579
the app on the right hand side that

386
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,720
there's a screenshot of is called

387
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,899
arrivecan and the Canadian government

388
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:32,820
requires you to fill fill out this uh

389
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,560
app every time that you cross their

390
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,660
border it was put in place for the

391
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,579
pandemic hopefully it goes away at some

392
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,680
point uh these these things though never

393
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,800
go away really so it may just be a thing

394
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
that we're going to have to fill out

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,699
indefinitely so a couple of things with

396
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,320
you know from private from a privacy

397
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,380
perspective uh the Canadian government

398
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,899
has refused to State whether or not they

399
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,360
track you using this app so personally I

400
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
install it on a phone that I can either

401
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,740
bring with me or not and fill it out

402
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,560
that way I tend to bring the phone along

403
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,300
when I want the Canadian government to

404
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,980
know exactly where I was at all times

405
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,899
and right now that's pretty much

406
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,160
everywhere

407
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,079
um that I am in Canada because it makes

408
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,240
things a lot easier if they verify that

409
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,440
what you told them that the border is

410
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,680
true but that is you know obviously your

411
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
call and it's a it's a privacy concern

412
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,699
that some people would have

413
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,259
uh

414
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,259
so border authorities do put you in the

415
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:31,019
system as a local and so if you're if

416
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,639
you are what's considered a habitual

417
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,139
resident of Point Roberts and the

418
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,639
Canadian government agrees that you are

419
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,880
then they will put you in as a habitual

420
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
resident and that means that you can use

421
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,839
certain features of the arrivecan app

422
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,699
that are not available to people that

423
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,100
don't live on the point full time

424
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,040
and Nexus is your friend so Nexus is a

425
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,360
program that's jointly between the

426
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
Canadian and the US government and you

427
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,720
can sign up for this and what it does is

428
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,180
it it enables you to use an expedited

429
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,800
Border Crossing Lane in both the United

430
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,420
States and Canada so it's kind of like

431
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,940
Global Entry uh but if you have Global

432
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,059
Entry you can only use that lane with

433
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,699
the U.S side and you can go through that

434
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,439
lane in both the US and the Canadian

435
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,140
side if you have Nexus so the thing with

436
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,720
Nexus is it's pretty hard to get for one

437
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,760
you have to be interviewed by both the

438
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,559
US and Canadian governments and right

439
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,599
now because of a dispute over whether or

440
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,559
not U.S customs agents can carry guns

441
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,959
inside of Canada only the U.S based

442
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,460
Nexus enrollment centers are open

443
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,740
because the U.S border guards can carry

444
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,360
guns there the Canadians aren't going to

445
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,980
let them carry guns inside of Canadian

446
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,559
airports and so those

447
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,660
all of those locations are indefinitely

448
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,000
closed meaning that half the capacity to

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,460
process interviews is effectively

450
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,179
missing right now on top of that if you

451
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,240
want Nexus you can only interview and

452
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,640
apply at an enrollment center near the

453
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,620
Canadian border so if you're going to do

454
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,419
Global Entry you know just anytime

455
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,500
you're coming back from an international

456
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,440
trip at any U.S entry point you can do

457
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,419
that interview and you cannot do that

458
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,520
for Nexus like it has to be only in

459
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
designated enrollment centers and the

460
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,240
the appointments are backed up a year or

461
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,980
so it's really a pain in the neck to get

462
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,780
it

463
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,940
but if you have it it really is your

464
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,020
friend when you live on the point

465
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,419
because it saves a ton of time

466
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,960
if you leave a lot and I leave some I

467
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,179
mean I come here but I spend most of my

468
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,500
time on the point

469
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,660
uh people wonder about border

470
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,919
restrictions I mean when you're Crossing

471
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,539
you can get searched you know they can

472
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,640
seize your stuff that there's like very

473
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,380
expansive border search Authority that

474
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,539
both countries have uh when you cross

475
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,520
the border so what does that mean in

476
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,500
Practical terms in day-to-day life well

477
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,080
the borders are open 24 7. first of all

478
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,120
so if you need to cross a border it's

479
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,940
available and you can totally do that uh

480
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,200
you need to have a clean criminal

481
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,720
history no felonies as Canada defines

482
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
them and that's why no DUIs because a

483
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,919
DUI in the US isn't a felony but it is

484
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
in Canada and Canada will not let you in

485
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
if you've committed what they believe to

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,039
what they consider to be a felony in

487
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:02,760
Canada

488
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,760
so your criminal record just that it

489
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,860
it's got to be pretty much completely

490
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,260
clean or before you consider moving up

491
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,440
there you should talk to the Canadian

492
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,620
cbsa and make sure that they according

493
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,419
to their understanding you're going to

494
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,100
be cleared to go through Canada because

495
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,480
otherwise it's going to be really bad

496
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,860
for you

497
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,419
um and yeah like once you live there

498
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,000
don't get a DUI don't do bad stuff

499
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,760
because if you do that's also going to

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,039
make your life very complicated

501
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,600
you've got to have the right to live in

502
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,740
the United States to live in Point

503
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,240
Roberts and so this is another thing

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,700
that that you know people ask a lot well

505
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,559
if I live in Vancouver can I just buy a

506
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,900
house in point Robertson commute and

507
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,160
live there and you know do the same

508
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,200
house hack that you did well no because

509
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,660
if you are in if you're Canadian and

510
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
you're in the United States for more

511
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,860
than 183 days a year that's too many

512
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,600
days and you get kicked out for six

513
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,299
months so it's um not something

514
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,100
unfortunately that's available unless

515
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,419
you're a dual Citizen and you've got a

516
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,700
US passport too and a lot of people on

517
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,620
Point Roberts are dual citizens 75

518
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,200
percent of residents are have passports

519
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
from both countries and so they can

520
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
commute to jobs in Canada and live on

521
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,799
Point Roberts and that's totally fine

522
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,880
uh but the same uh applies in Reverse so

523
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,240
if you live on point if you want to live

524
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,520
in Canada and you have only a U.S

525
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,900
passport the Canadians aren't going to

526
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,220
let you do that either they have the

527
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,679
same 183 day restriction and this can

528
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,780
complicate cross-border relationships so

529
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,039
say that you fall in love with somebody

530
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,440
who lives in a different country and

531
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,059
most of the people in the Vancouver area

532
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,919
are north of the Border they're not on

533
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,020
Point Roberts well

534
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,820
you're going to have to count your days

535
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,640
of who's staying overnight at whose

536
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,380
house and you're not going to easily be

537
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,120
able to combine your home without

538
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,020
paperwork so just keep that in mind

539
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,539
so more on Border searches and

540
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,460
restrictions people just you know really

541
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,440
are very focused on this area and I get

542
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,940
it I mean it's it's kind of scary

543
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,919
Crossing Borders most of us don't do it

544
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,320
very often it's like certainly not

545
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
twice a day like many Point Roberts

546
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,299
residents do uh each Direction

547
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:10,919
um and

548
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,500
so what are the rules you can't have

549
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,720
more than 800 pre-tax and goods that

550
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,340
you're importing from Canada so if I go

551
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,919
up to Canadian Tire and I buy

552
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,100
for instance a uh you know like a steel

553
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,620
pergola for the for my back patio which

554
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,880
I did

555
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,460
it's what they do is they take the price

556
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,620
in Canadian dollars convert it to us

557
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,500
they subtract the tax convert that

558
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,659
amount to US Dollars and it needs to be

559
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,720
under 800 if it's over 800 that's

560
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,919
actually fine you're allowed to bring

561
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,900
stuff in from Canada it's no problem you

562
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,480
just have to pay tax on that and the tax

563
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,820
rate isn't very high so and they only

564
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,400
charge it on the difference and usually

565
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,900
they just don't want to do the paperwork

566
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,640
so just declare everything when you

567
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,380
bring it across if they say if they ask

568
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,880
if you bought something in Canada just

569
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
say what you did and usually they'll

570
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
wave you through uh if it's only if

571
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
you're buying really expensive stuff

572
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
like a car or something like that in

573
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,360
Canada that that you know customs and

574
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,980
paperwork gets involved

575
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,340
uh it's relatively easy to transport

576
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,900
things through Canada from the mainland

577
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,980
so if you want to go over to the

578
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,539
mainland and go to the Home Depot in

579
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,700
Bellingham and bring stuff back through

580
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,260
Canada now technically you're supposed

581
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,059
to do paperwork and pay tax on it when

582
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,220
you bring it into Canada and then clean

583
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,440
the tax back at the other at the

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,159
Boundary Bay Port of Entry and you know

585
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,140
it's just and that's more paperwork and

586
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,520
you basically did a lot of paperwork

587
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,960
paid money and it was refunded and

588
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
everyone wasted their time so in

589
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,860
practice uh what the Border guards will

590
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,720
ask is do you plan to stop in Canada or

591
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,220
are you driving straight through and if

592
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,179
you

593
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,220
um if you make an attestation that

594
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,020
you're driving straight through then

595
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,000
they'll let you do that usually with

596
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,620
with you know things you pop for your

597
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,440
house or whatever but and one question

598
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,880
they'll ask a lot is do you have

599
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,020
anything with you that you're planning

600
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,120
to leave in Canada now if you do have

601
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,679
things with you that you plan to leave

602
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,600
in Canada if you've got gifts for

603
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,980
example that you want to give to a

604
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,679
friend that lives in Canada

605
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,820
depending on what the value of that is

606
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,919
there could be paperwork and Duty charge

607
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,799
and the Canadian government is really

608
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,620
sticklers about charging that Duty so

609
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,900
they're going to make you pay and and do

610
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,640
all the paperwork and so it's better if

611
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,900
you're going to get a gift for somebody

612
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,020
in Canada Amazon delivers to a locker

613
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,260
like Amazon Canada has lockers and there

614
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,240
is at the 7-Eleven just across the

615
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,980
border there's an Amazon Locker so you

616
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,240
can just order something from Amazon

617
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,179
Canada pay the Canadian tax have it

618
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,679
delivered to an Amazon Locker and then

619
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,120
you've got your gift for your Canadian

620
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,740
friend and you don't have to deal with

621
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,860
any of that and of course it's only 15

622
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,960
minutes to the largest mall in British

623
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,059
Columbia so you've got plenty of

624
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,279
shopping in into Austin there's uh

625
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
there's really no reason to you know to

626
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
buy stuff in the US and bring it to to

627
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,659
Canadians so yes you can be searched

628
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,140
anytime for any reason however

629
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,940
keep in mind that the Border search

630
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,740
authority of Customs and Border

631
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,600
Protection in the United States is

632
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,220
really expansive if you live within 100

633
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,960
miles of a border they can show up and

634
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,299
search you anytime they want to so it's

635
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,880
really no different at the border uh and

636
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,279
that that Authority is rarely exercised

637
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,520
at outside of a border crossing it's

638
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,039
also relatively rarely exercised at a

639
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,360
border crossing if you're somebody who's

640
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,520
a routine border Crosser and they know

641
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
what your travel patterns are and you've

642
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
especially if you've been pre-cleared as

643
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,640
a trusted traveler so you know in

644
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,960
practice you don't get searched much

645
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,480
they totally can do it anytime they want

646
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,059
to for any or no reason and you need to

647
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,700
be prepared for that but also if you're

648
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,779
if you don't have anything you're not

649
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,179
supposed to have then there's not any

650
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,039
problem they just wasted their time and

651
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,779
yours and you just have to plan that

652
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,640
into your day that anytime you cross the

653
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,860
border it could be an extra hour while

654
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,620
they decide to look through your stuff

655
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,720
generally speaking it's really rare uh

656
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,100
you know unless you really take off a

657
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,500
Border guard or you happen to be be

658
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,360
bringing something that's a flagged item

659
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,799
that they have that they're required to

660
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,960
dig deeper because of and you know

661
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
certain pesticides and those kinds of

662
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,000
things can can cause a deeper search

663
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,059
those are like agricultural items uh you

664
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,559
know if you declare a prohibited

665
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,000
agricultural item they're probably going

666
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,140
to want to look at all your fruits and

667
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,520
vegetables and meats just to make sure

668
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,919
they're all there they're all okay but

669
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,779
generally speaking you don't get

670
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,779
searched a ton if you're not obviously

671
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,400
up to anything shady and you're a

672
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
regular border Crosser

673
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,799
so some local amenities

674
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,400
um

675
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,580
most of the stuff most of my shopping is

676
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,340
up in tawasan most of the stuff that I

677
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,039
do is on the Canadian side but we do

678
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,779
have some local amenities as well

679
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,720
there's a full-service Supermarket uh

680
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,279
we've got one grocery store it's around

681
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,539
the same size as a safe way or Kroger if

682
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,760
you're from that part of the country

683
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,620
there's a Bitcoin ATM which I think is

684
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,240
kind of funny

685
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,520
there's five gas stations too many Marts

686
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
fuels sold in liters which is a little

687
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,740
bit unusual uh costs are comparable at

688
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,720
the gas stations to Seattle prices so

689
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,039
you're going to pay around the same as

690
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,900
you would in Seattle that's a little bit

691
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,880
more than on the on the U.S mainland in

692
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Washington but it's also way easier to

693
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
come into Point Roberts from the

694
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,100
Vancouver area so we sell a lot of gas

695
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,220
and it's a you know 50 cents a gallon

696
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,860
maybe more than the Bellingham Costco

697
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,600
there's a full service Marina with a

698
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,279
fuel truck and shadowy and that actually

699
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,820
gets a ton of boater traffic because

700
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,080
boaters who are heading to Canada for

701
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,419
fishing usually will stop off and

702
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,000
they'll fill their big boat tanks with

703
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
much less expensive gasoline than in

704
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Canada

705
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,419
there's a k-3 school and that's really

706
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,940
fun uh there's so it's a one classroom

707
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,620
school with one teacher and

708
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,600
kindergartners for third graders go to

709
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,940
school on the point after third grade

710
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,340
they get bust over to Blaine which means

711
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,900
that the kids are crossing four borders

712
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,140
a day or they all have to have passports

713
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,900
and it it's you know an extra hour of

714
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,760
commute time it makes it a little hard

715
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,740
on the kids because you know unless

716
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,840
their parents can go drive through four

717
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,460
borders and pick them up they can't do

718
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,159
any after school activities or anything

719
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:15,360
and they also have to get up really

720
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,580
early to be able to make it so if you're

721
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,799
if you have school-aged kids or you're

722
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,120
planning to have them

723
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,760
do consider whether or not that's

724
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,159
something you want to do many of the

725
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,080
tech people who live on Point Roberts

726
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,580
you know our salaries in the tech

727
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,100
industry tend to be a little bit higher

728
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,440
and so then then most of the locals

729
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,480
there and so it could be affordable to

730
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,980
send your kids to private school in

731
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,179
tawasan

732
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,480
it's you know way cheaper than

733
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,200
international schools in most cases so

734
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,460
that can pencil out for a lot of people

735
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,440
and then it's just 10 minutes away

736
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,720
instead of you know that hour commute

737
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,700
and after school activities become more

738
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,659
practical

739
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,000
uh there's one bank with an ATM that

740
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,279
dispenses USD it's a it's a bank called

741
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,860
Umpqua it's a local bank from Oregon uh

742
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,480
and we're grateful to have it it's the

743
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,340
only bank that's left Banner Bank closed

744
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,860
and left uh if you if you fly your own

745
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,720
plane or if you want to there's a grass

746
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,640
airstrip it's legally in the United

747
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,159
States there are no Customs clearing

748
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,620
facilities at Point Roberts airport you

749
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,659
have to clear Customs back into the U.S

750
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,460
and Bellingham but if you want to fly

751
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,080
back and forth between Mainland

752
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,059
Washington and Point Roberts you can do

753
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,100
that and that gets interesting right

754
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,980
because it's not that far to Seattle so

755
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,020
you actually could commute by a plane

756
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,179
down there if you had to you know work

757
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,159
at Microsoft or something like that

758
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,580
uh and uh hardware store is called

759
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,100
Nielsen's and they offer a full line uh

760
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,020
plus they have U-Haul rentals keep

761
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,299
monkey into this thing wish my clicker

762
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,200

763
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,240
hey it works

764
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,820
okay laptop figured out how to make my

765
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,860
clicker work great uh so there's even

766
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,419
more local Services we've got three

767
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,940
restaurants and a food truck uh Mexican

768
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,480
food coming soon Antonio Sula one of the

769
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,360
locals was making Mexican food at the

770
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,059
deli of the marketplace but he's decided

771
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,100
to Branch out on his own and and do a

772
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,840
food truck and his food is awesome it's

773
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,720
all completely legit uh their potty

774
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,419
wagon comes and does portable toilets

775
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:16,799
and they pump your septic and that's

776
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,020
good because every home has septic so

777
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,539
you should get to know them uh if you

778
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,100
need your roof cleaned your windows

779
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,720
washed any of that kind of thing there's

780
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,820
a Bellingham company that'll come over

781
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,679
and provide services on the point there

782
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,320
is one local guy but he's battling some

783
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,440
health problems right now so for now the

784
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,539
Bellingham company is is the one that

785
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,100
can come and do it

786
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,620
there's a mechanic in a detail shop uh

787
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,059
and so anything you need done with your

788
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,039
car you can get done on the point which

789
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,799
is great or they can at least patch it

790
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,120
up enough that you can get up to

791
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,980
Canadian Tire which is 15 minutes away

792
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,140
and that's a full service shop that can

793
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,159
do anything

794
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,380
uh and then there's a newspaper even

795
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,899
which is kind of wild but it's a monthly

796
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:00,000
it's like actually printed on dead trees

797
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,980
it's called the Allpoint bulletin and

798
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,960
it's online as well so feel free to take

799
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,020
a look at it uh pack grub is uh the

800
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,000
editor and writes most of the stories

801
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,940
and honestly it's it's like pretty well

802
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,159
done they cover issues that that are

803
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,980
relevant to our area it's it's like true

804
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,080
local journalism and you just don't see

805
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,059
that very much anymore

806
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,460
uh so the phone and Internet situation

807
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,380
when people you know talk to me they say

808
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,120
there's got to be a catch like what's

809
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,159
the deal here well the deal is like if

810
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,659
you look at Power 10 power 10 megabits

811
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,240
that's that's uh my internet's like I've

812
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,600
got the next tier app it's 15 megabits

813
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,399
down and two up and that's all I can get

814
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:46,500
uh so you have to get creative you have

815
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,240
to think like a hacker if you want to

816
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,100
have faster internet

817
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,440
um so would be telephone is pretty bad

818
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,659
uh at least in terms of the service that

819
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:55,860
they're offering that's not just me

820
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,659
saying that the Washington State

821
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,820
Department of Commerce ran a study of

822
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,200
communities across the state of

823
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,419
Washington and Point Roberts rated the

824
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,640
slowest so would be telephone is

825
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,500
providing as ranked by the Washington

826
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
State uh Department of Commerce the

827
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,240
slowest internet service in the state

828
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,820
thank you would be telephone so some

829
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,679
people use starlink with varying results

830
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,659
it does drop out a bit and we've got

831
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,640
tall trees everywhere and so that makes

832
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,260
it pretty tough also we're pretty far

833
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,360
north right on the 49th parallel which

834
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,740
means a lot of atmosphere to punch

835
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,840
through uh makes it kind of tough for

836
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,940
Zoom calls but when it works it does

837
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,860
work really well and as fast according

838
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,539
to the people that have it

839
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,880
uh there's gonna be fiber to the home

840
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,460
allegedly from would be telephones

841
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,340
starting in 2025 they got very large

842
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,880
grants from uh the USDA of all things

843
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,220
millions of dollars of money uh Federal

844
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,159
money so far they've uh dug some

845
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,140
trenches and they've got some spools of

846
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,340
fiber around there's nothing really

847
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,320
going on right now because uh they have

848
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,760
some issue getting their Upstream

849
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,700
connectivity from Bell Canada turned on

850
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,320
uh or so they claim

851
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,260
um and Verizon has a tower with LTE on

852
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,840
it and that can go up to 20 30 megabits

853
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,480
sometimes you can you can get a solid 15

854
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,440
at any given point so maybe you do some

855
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,600
Verizon and you mix it up with the DSL

856
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,519
or maybe you go for starlink and and

857
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,140
that works for you it just really

858
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,820
depends what you're doing I spend a lot

859
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,980
of time on zoom and so I need something

860
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,419
that's pretty reliable the good news

861
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,360
with zoom is it's just really good at

862
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,240
dealing with terrible connectivity

863
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,460
that's just one of the things that that

864
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,059
they do a great job at and so for me

865
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,559
um and the stuff and the kind of work

866
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,120
that I do which is mostly working in

867
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,880
Google apps and and having Zoom calls uh

868
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,740
it works pretty well

869
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,260
um for for ADSL it just gets really

870
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,519
annoying if you want to run more than

871
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,340
one device or uh if you're you know

872
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,019
trying to stream 4K or something like

873
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,700
that

874
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,760
uh Logistics so people ask like what are

875
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,380
the logistics how do you even get stuff

876
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,240
there it's you know that's got to be

877
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
really hard clearing two borders

878
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,740
um yeah so

879
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,159
in order to get anything large onto the

880
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,419
point you either need to bring it

881
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,659
yourself and you can totally do that or

882
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,419
you can hire Point Robert's auto Freight

883
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,700
uh to bring it in their bonded carrier

884
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,860
and so what's a bonded carrier it means

885
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,100
that they seal up the truck at the

886
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,720
Canadian border and the Canadian

887
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,340
government agrees that whatever's in

888
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,620
there it's basically in the U.S and and

889
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,779
it never entered Canada and then it gets

890
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,179
unsealed when the truck arrives in Point

891
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,620
Roberts and that is basically how stuff

892
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,080
gets in so things that would be

893
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
prohibited agricultural items can come

894
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,940
in that way things that are uh you know

895
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,740
that are that would be charge tax in

896
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,840
Canada can come in that way the service

897
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,539
isn't cheap it is available and you know

898
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:53,399
it's just part of the cost of of uh

899
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,720
doing business when you live on the

900
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,059
point uh anything that you can order

901
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,519
from UPS and FedEx will show up just

902
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,899
like if you were anywhere else in the

903
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,260
United States and USPS as well so

904
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,720
and all of those are bonded carriers too

905
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,300
the thing is that ups only deals with

906
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,280
stuff up to 70 pounds so if you want to

907
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,599
order something bigger it's going to end

908
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,339
up delivered through Point Roberts Auto

909
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:15,899
Freight usually

910
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,699
and then uh one thing that I think is

911
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,099
kind of funny is because you can order

912
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,839
anything online and have it delivered to

913
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,399
Point Roberts and it's being delivered

914
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,500
to the US but it's right next to Canada

915
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,960
a lot of Canadians do their online

916
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,440
shopping on U.S sites where Goods can be

917
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,540
cheaper or there's a wide variety wider

918
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,339
variety of stuff or things are available

919
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,260
often in the US before they're available

920
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,960
in Canada and so there's this cottage

921
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,719
industry of uh places where you can just

922
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,699
have your package sent in Point Roberts

923
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,379
and for two or three dollars they'll

924
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,359
receive it for you and and you can come

925
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,980
down and get it from Canada

926
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,800
so that's that's kind of cool but

927
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,359
there's challenges the Border does

928
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,339
create a real barrier and a

929
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,320
psychological barrier there's you know

930
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,780
you need bonded carriers for large items

931
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,420
uh online shopping has a more limited

932
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,160
selection if you go to Amazon and you

933
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
punch in a rural zip code anywhere in in

934
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,260
the rural us uh I looked at you know in

935
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,180
the outskirts of Olympia before and and

936
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,980
it was the same kind of thing right you

937
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,200
don't get that like Amazon Prime now

938
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,540
stuff uh stuff that can be delivered

939
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,260
today uh or by Amazon Trucks Only that's

940
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,480
not going to be available so if anything

941
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
that Amazon can send you via UPS or

942
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,980
FedEx or Walmart or any of your online

943
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,079
retailers that's the stuff that you're

944
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,660
going to have this election to do so if

945
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,400
and this could this gets to be a really

946
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,800
big problem with Walmart because they

947
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,140
default to using doordash to send you

948
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,880
stuff like out of the grocery section

949
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,619
and then you get all the way to the end

950
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,859
and you find out you can't do it so

951
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,540
you'll get used to this once you you

952
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,859
know and knowing what kind of items you

953
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,500
can can get or not cannabis is

954
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,599
effectively illegal as I brought up and

955
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,339
availability of services can be a

956
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:57,900
challenge right it's a really small

957
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,119
community with 850 people who live there

958
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,700
year round and that means that if

959
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,040
there's an electrician who prefers large

960
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,800
jobs uh so your your small electrical

961
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,260
jobs are going to be on a waiting list

962
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,640
and they could be a while before they

963
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,400
get done there's one guy that does roofs

964
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,579
and his son and it's and you know

965
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,380
they're really good but they have a

966
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,880
really long waiting list because they

967
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,520
roof every house on the point there's

968
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,020
two landscaping companies and they're

969
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,359
just not taking new clients and there's

970
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,520
one plumber who's semi-retired and lives

971
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920
in Canada he's a dual citizen

972
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,500
so what's the opportunity it's

973
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,420
unincorporated Whatcom County what does

974
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,000
that mean uh and you you know that you

975
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,140
know me you know there's going to be

976
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,020
something conspiratorial here right so

977
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,420
unincorporated Whatcom County means that

978
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,480
there's very few regulations if you live

979
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,960
in in an unincorporated part of a county

980
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,839
there's no City police there's no city

981
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,960
regulations there's just none of that so

982
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,599
the things that you can you may want to

983
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,000
do on your land that are crazy ideas

984
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,060
anywhere else you can totally do on

985
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,020
Point Roberts possibly only around 850

986
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,940
people live there year round

987
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,160
most are retired two-thirds three

988
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,900
quarters depending how you count are

989
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,140
dual citizens they don't like change but

990
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,000
they know that a reboot is needed for

991
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,740
the community to survive so many people

992
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,020
left uh during the 15 months that the

993
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,079
Border was closed uh that you know

994
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,280
there's just

995
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,839
something different than what they've

996
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,880
done before is going to be needed and

997
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,400
the place literally exists because of a

998
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
border hack their whole history has been

999
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,880
Geographic Arbitrage so if there's

1000
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,320
anywhere in the in the world that's

1001
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,980
hacker friendly this place is and so

1002
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,200
what's my pitch

1003
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,460
if

1004
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,099
we want to turn a place into I'm wearing

1005
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,079
a tour camp shirt and Point Roberts is

1006
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,380
around 25 miles or 20 miles Northwest of

1007
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,480
tour camp and so if you've been to tour

1008
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,099
Camp you know that when hackers gather

1009
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,560
and are and get the opportunity to be

1010
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,020
creative together in one place

1011
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,000
a lot of magic happens because when you

1012
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,560
have enough of a concentration of

1013
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,820
hackers

1014
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,180
the amount of creativity and awesomeness

1015
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,200
that happens is really very difficult to

1016
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,579
match anywhere else in the world and we

1017
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,200
do the same thing at hacker summer camp

1018
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
every year in Las Vegas right when all

1019
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,060
of us come together and make a lot of

1020
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,920
really cool stuff happen and so I was

1021
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,960
thinking why can't it be tour Camp every

1022
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,420
day why can't it be uh Defcon and

1023
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,660
b-sides all the time and

1024
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,060
one way that could happen is if you have

1025
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,859
a place that's safe it's geographically

1026
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:43,920
re distributed there's the ability it's

1027
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,320
geographically restricted it's close to

1028
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,320
the the amenities of a major city so you

1029
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,480
can get to an airport in 25 minutes you

1030
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,700
have access to all of the stuff of a

1031
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,260
world-class City like Vancouver can

1032
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,380
offer but you get to live around a whole

1033
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,300
bunch of really smart creative awesome

1034
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,640
hackers and so uh somebody had to be

1035
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,280
first so I moved but I don't need to be

1036
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,079
the only hacker who lives there and I'd

1037
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,060
like to invite all of the people who are

1038

1059
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,339
there is a hand raised uh blue shirt

1060
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,220
yeah sure so the question was for for

1061
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,540
people in the Stream

1062
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,119
um hey there's this small matter of the

1063
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,800
fact that your border was closed for 15

1064
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,200
months so nobody could leave like during

1065
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,180
the pandemic uh would you care to

1066
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,760
address that yes

1067
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,560
um so what happened is the Canadian

1068
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,300
government and the US government agreed

1069
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,400
to mutually shut the border which is the

1070
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,020
first time in history that's happened

1071
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,540
and it was closed for 15 months

1072
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,579
and there was no exception for uh

1073
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:47,040
initially for Border communities and

1074
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,599
Border dependent communities on both

1075
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,859
sides of the Border

1076
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,260
that created a lot of problems and

1077
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,560
obviously the gears of government turned

1078
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,839
slowly in both Washington DC and Ottawa

1079
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,240
especially during a pandemic when nobody

1080
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,680
knows how to coordinate anything and

1081
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,940
they're all trying to figure out how to

1082
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,300
work remotely after a couple of months

1083
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,800
the Canadian government ended up coming

1084
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,720
out with an exception for essential

1085
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,540
services so what they would do is they'd

1086
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,099
let you through to the mainland of

1087
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,380
Washington if you didn't stop in Canada

1088
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,060
at all for anything that they deemed

1089
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,579
essential the problem was that you know

1090
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,260
if your horse has an eye infection and

1091
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,260
as Lucy and I as happened to one

1092
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,319
person's horse or my neighbor's cat had

1093
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,099
a

1094
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,440
kidney problem and couldn't pee for two

1095
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,480
days and like was in excruciating pain

1096
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,900
and nearly died it was up to the Border

1097
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,460
guard that you got and whether or not

1098
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,380
they considered that to be essential or

1099
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,859
not and some border guards had a more

1100
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,300
generous interpretation of that than

1101
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,240
others so uh you know the horse lost its

1102
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,260
eye

1103
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,280
um

1104
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,900
I understand my neighbor threatened to

1105
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,760
abandon the cat at the Border in Canada

1106
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,619
at which point then it would be an

1107
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,960
animal welfare issue that they'd have to

1108
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,119
deal with and that was the way that uh

1109
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,099
that she was able to take it to the vet

1110
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,540
but

1111
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,240
um anyhow that's it it was really rough

1112
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,460
for a while and then the Canadian

1113
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,020
government gradually loosened

1114
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,760
restrictions and look I get it you know

1115
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,800
they they had a really big problem early

1116
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,380
with with uh Americans claiming they

1117
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,480
were going to Alaska and then going and

1118
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,579
taking vacations in Alberta and you know

1119
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,380
in some cases people brought coveted

1120
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,880
with them and they'd had it really well

1121
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,579
under control so I get what they're I

1122
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,560
get why they were so conservative also

1123
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,020
Canada has socialized health care so

1124
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,819
they're thinking from our perspective of

1125
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,560
what do they need to do to to maintain

1126
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,540
the public health and not have to spend

1127
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,160
crazy amounts of money I mean they can't

1128
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,420
just dump the problem on their

1129
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,880
population they have to deal with it so

1130
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,680
their government was way more

1131
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,540
conservative than ours whether or not

1132
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,819
that was the right decision

1133
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,319
um you know that's for history to decide

1134
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,140
it was pretty rough for a while these

1135
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,880
days you have to fill out a Rifkin

1136
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,359
that's at the the borders open Canada is

1137
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,880
open for business we're welcome again

1138
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,980
um you know Canadian people are not mad

1139
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,140
at us like there's no vandalism of

1140
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,640
course that was going on earlier because

1141
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,980
uh you know the Canadian public was just

1142
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,140
outraged when people were using the the

1143
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,480
Alaska

1144
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,619
border hack when people were saying that

1145
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,880
they were going to Alaska and really

1146
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,740
they went on vacation in Canada that was

1147
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,260
just like completely outrageous uh to to

1148
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,740
the Canadian public and so there was

1149
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,839
some public anger and outrage that

1150
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,940
resulted from that but things have blown

1151
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,500
over these days Canadians are pretty

1152
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,380
good natured overall so um it's water

1153
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,720
under the bridge at this point and uh

1154
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,700
you know we're pretty close to back to

1155
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,619
business as usual as much as we can be

1156
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,119
in a pandemic

1157
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,319
any other yeah

1158
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,900
so the question is you live in the

1159
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,940
Pacific Northwest also known as the

1160
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,220
Pacific Northwest

1161
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,140
where it's famous for being cloudy all

1162
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,700
the time and if I have seasonal

1163
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,339
affective disorder am I gonna get that

1164
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:17,040
if I move to your rainy corner of the

1165
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,260
world where it's very gloomy and rainy

1166
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,740
all the time and the good news is uh

1167
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,119
probably not on point Robert

1168
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,460
specifically because it's in a rain

1169
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,160
shadow Point Roberts and and tawasan

1170
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,520
just happen to be in a spot where the

1171
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,560
clouds are mostly blocked by a mountain

1172
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,240
on Vancouver Island across the water

1173
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,760
which is uh maybe 30 miles away

1174
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,640
and so it is we get more Sun than

1175
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,680
anywhere else in the Lower Mainland uh

1176
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,960
it does rainstall uh just like it can

1177
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,180
pretty much anywhere outside of the

1178
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Southwest but uh it's not nearly as bad

1179
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,280
as you would think uh the thing that you

1180
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,960
do need to keep in mind is if you need

1181
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,060
to get sunlight our days are really

1182
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,359
short in the winter so it can be

1183
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,760
you know sometimes seven or eight hours

1184
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,099
of daylight maybe so the thing is if you

1185
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,960
work remote and you can walk to the

1186
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,280
beach and take your meetings there it's

1187
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,319
not all that cold it does not get super

1188
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,359
cold in the Pacific Northwest because

1189
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,460
we're our climate is moderated by the

1190
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,700
water and so I take a walk every day

1191
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,060
even in the winter its node once

1192
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,520
um over the winter but that's pretty

1193
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,960
rare

1194
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,240
any other questions

1195
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,579
this Laphroaig 25 is phenomenal by the

1196
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,920
way I've never had it so

1197
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,680
um I hope I don't have a new habit of a

1198
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,160
550 a bottle of Scotch

1199
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,420
thank you b-sides for this

1200
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,299
anything else

1201
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,440
Yes No Maybe

1202
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,240
all right so I don't see any other

1203
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,700
questions from the audience but again

1204
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,119
like I'm totally serious I think that it

1205
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,700
is time to build a hacker City if at

1206
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,780
some point Roberts it should be

1207
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,000
somewhere but why not Point Roberts

1208
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,520
foreign
