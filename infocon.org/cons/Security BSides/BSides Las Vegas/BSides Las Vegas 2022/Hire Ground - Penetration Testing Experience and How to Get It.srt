00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,800
thank you for coming for the

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,380
continuation of day two of Higher Ground

I'm Kathleen Smith yes it's Kathleen on

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,200
Twitter I'm the lead and creator of

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,540
Higher Ground because we wanted to

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,660
create a safe and valuable space for

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,180
people in the community to learn about

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,779
their careers get advice get feedback be

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,359
able to have beneficial conversations

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,300
rather than being hounded by a recruiter

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,240
in the afternoons we do career coaching

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
and resume reviewing resume reviewing is

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,300
done by recruiters that I trust and vet

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,760
that are part of the community and then

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,399
career coaches who have had more than 10

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,340
to 15 years experience and have had a

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,920
varied career so that we know that they

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,960
can provide you advice as far as

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,180
different challenges that you've had or

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,920
if you want to switch around from one

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,500
industry to the next I'm really excited

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,239
to have Phil with us this morning I've

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,399
always seen him presenting at other

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,199
conferences and I finally got up enough

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,260
or you know gumption to ask him to

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,119
submit a talk because I can't pick I

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,460
have to just ask people to submit just

28
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,979
so you know we are recording this so

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,299
Phil's going to have to stay really

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,240
close to the mic but also you don't need

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
to take screenshots of what he's going

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,479
to present because you can just go back

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,240
and watch it on YouTube later so with

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,700
that Phil thanks for coming and joining

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,080
us here

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,039
thanks for having me

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
thanks everyone for joining today and uh

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,900
thanks to Kathleen for uh

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,579
in uh

40
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,680
recommending me to submit a talk here so

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
this is a this is awesome Village for me

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
because uh one of the things I love

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,340
doing is helping other people uh

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,960
a few years ago you know I've always

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,399
been a competitive person I used to

46
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,680
compete in powerlifting and I worked in

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
a jewelry store before selling jewelry

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
and always wanted to sell the most oh

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
you know whenever I was 15 I got shot

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,460
and the bullet pumped through my heart

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,320
and I actually almost died from it but

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,759
the thing I was worried about was laying

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,140
on the ground before the Amos got there

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,840
is that my 250 pound bench press would

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
be passed up by my classmate so I've

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,318
always been super competitive

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,120
and you know in the industry you know

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,980
you always try to be competitive too and

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,900
it when you get to be almost 60 years

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,599
old it's hard to keep up with the

61
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,280
younger people it's easier to stay up to

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,140
three five a.m in the morning

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,360
learning whereas you get older it gets

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,620
more difficult you need more sleep to

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,120
recuperate and one of the things I

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
started thinking about is that the play

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
towards my strengths is always a lot

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,580
better mentor and coach

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,739
than I was a pen tester although I did

70
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,560
well as pin testing but I'm patient I

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,080
like helping people I'm a pretty decent

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300
listener so that's what drew me to that

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,519
area so it's honored to be here and this

74
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,019
is actually the perfect Village for me

75
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,480
to be speaking at

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
so for those of you that don't know me

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm Phillip Wiley I have my cissp oscp

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,019
and Sans web app pin testing

79
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,239
certifications so my current role as

80
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,040
manager of tech evangelism and

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,560
enablement at cycognito So speaking is

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,720
part of my job doing webinars podcasts

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,940
going to conferences as well as

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,000
education internally because our product

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
does some of the things that pen testing

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,900
does and security assessments do but to

87
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,400
be able to explain to ourselves people

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
how those items work so it was a good

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
good fit for me so I've been in uh

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,599
offensive security for a little over 10

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
years a total of uh 18 and a half years

92
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
in cyber security prior to that I was a

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,080
CIS admin for a little over six years

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,900
and so I used to teach ethical hacking

95
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,280
and web app pin testing at Dallas

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,040
college and really that's what all got

97
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,780
really got me started in speaking at

98
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,940
conferences because my book The Pen

99
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,560
tester blueprint came from a class

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
lecture which got turned into a

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
conference talk and eventually a book

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,379
so also run a couple different groups

103
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,260
the pawn school project and Defcon 940

104
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,959
in Denton Texas I'm the concept Creator

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,220
and co-author of the pen tester

106
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,040
blueprint and I host a podcast called

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
The Hacker Factory podcast on itsp

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,519
magazine so if you're interested in

109
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,439
hearing some inspiring stories and

110
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,000
advice from others it's a good good

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,459
platform we've had Dave Kennedy Alyssa

112
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,200
Knight but the interesting thing is is

113
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
the people just got into the industry

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
those are the ones that usually uh

115
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,440
interest people the most

116
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,899
and so I like to share this slide of how

117
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,079
I got into to uh pen testing because

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,600
when I graduated high school in 1984 I

119
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,400
was a power lifter you know and just you

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,620
know your stereotypical uh you know

121
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,139
Meathead power lifter you know all

122
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,820
bronze no brains and I didn't think it'd

123
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,979
ever be you know using my mind for a

124
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,180
living so I like to share this because

125
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,580
some people have imposter syndrome or

126
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,139
lack of confidence that don't think they

127
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,300
can do it and you can if I went from

128
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,580
being a pro wrestler to being a pen

129
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,020
tester you can do it too if you're

130
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,180
passionate about it and want to learn

131
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,100
that's great some people are gifted and

132
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,600
they learn it well but really the people

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,880
that have the the passion the desire and

134
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,979
the persistence they'll outperform the

135
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,060
people that are gifted because they're

136
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,259
putting in the time they like what

137
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,639
they're doing

138
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,440
so I started out as a pro wrestler

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,199
needed a more stable career I'd worked

140
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,240
uh putting up fences worked in retail

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,000
cells was a bouncer at an eye Club did

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,340
all sorts of jobs back then physical

143
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,039
security and other things I really liked

144
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,500
and I really couldn't keep a job or

145
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,759
working a place long because I didn't

146
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,280
enjoy what I was doing I was working at

147
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,100
a jewelry store and the the family that

148
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,419
owned the joy store they were starting a

149
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,280
new chain and they wanted me to be an

150
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,500
assistant manager there but the manager

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
of the store had someone else he liked

152
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,380
better and I kind of learned at that

153
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,120
point I got to get some skills and it's

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,919
got to be based on something although

155
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,479
you get in the industry there can be

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,160
some politics but you know when you're

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,199
working retail sales and working in

158
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,699
restaurants a lot of times your

159
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,960
promotions and stuff are based off

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
whether the manager likes you and so

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,400
forth so I went to a trade school and

162
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,139
learned AutoCAD

163
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,360
uh did that for a while and before that

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,220
I had no computer experience and I found

165
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,380
they had more of a knack for the

166
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,819
computer side of things so I taught

167
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,100
myself how to build computers got Nobel

168
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,840
Network certified and then got a course

169
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,620
got a my first job con Contracting for a

170
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,259
company doing server and uh Workstation

171
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,699
rollouts so during that sysadmin uh

172
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,460
period of my career I found out about uh

173
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,220
information security so I moved into the

174
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,319
security team at the mortgage company I

175
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,180
worked for started out doing network

176
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,639
security also some security assessments

177
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,560
and risk assessments and then we had a

178
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
new CSO come into the company and he set

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,360
up an appsec team he had more of a

180
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,860
modern view of the way companies were

181
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,020
doing things so I got to move over the

182
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,400
appsec team and that's where I found out

183
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,900
about pin testing I was managing

184
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,180
third-party pen tests that we'd have

185
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,979
Consultants come in and do as well as

186
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,440
doing some vulnerability scanning I got

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,160
to go to some vendor demos of uh web

188
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,539
inspect the web application

189
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,220
vulnerability scanner and it really got

190
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,440
me interested and so in 2012 I got laid

191
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,060
off and I went to work as a pen tester

192
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,280
and one things that that helped me and

193
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,440
the advice I like to share is if you

194
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,819
don't have all the experience everything

195
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,280
needed still apply because what got me

196
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,620
the job was I was talking to the hiring

197
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,780
manager I'd run vulnerability scanners I

198
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,340
worked in security I had a system in

199
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,080
background I had some some base level

200
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,819
knowledge I didn't have the hacking

201
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,860
piece I'd never performed a pen test but

202
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,419
he saw that at a home had a home lab and

203
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,160
I was teaching myself I taught myself

204
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,500
how to do web design I hosted a web

205
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,080
server at home with my clients websites

206
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,860
set up uh send mail for my mail transfer

207
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,199
agent and hosted my own DNS so I got

208
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,120
this experience so he saw that I like to

209
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,759
build things and learn on my own and so

210
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,380
that helped me get the job because there

211
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,900
really wasn't uh I really wasn't

212
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,060
qualified the guy took it took a risk on

213
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,400
me and when I got into that I had to to

214
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,960
learn how to do pet testing so I took

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,060
the oscp where I gained my hacking

216
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,400
skills so if you want to do this apply

217
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
for it I've had students that come in

218
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
really uh ambitious the first day of

219
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,819
class saying yeah I want to be a good

220
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,620
pen tester as you but I want to do it in

221
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,940
a shorter period of time so yeah you put

222
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,379
in more time and effort you put in there

223
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,400
you can get in there as quick as you

224
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,780
want to

225
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,580
second week into the class he comes up

226
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,660
and say hey do I have to read the

227
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,699
textbook if I want to be a pen tester

228
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,460
so I said well if you need to spend more

229
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,139
times in Labs learn the Hands-On piece

230
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,520
because that's important

231
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
and then he turned around and at the end

232
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,639
of the semester he got an internship as

233
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,440
a pen tester and he was like the last

234
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,819
one in the class that I thought would

235
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,280
get it but just from his uh motivation

236
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,780
and passion he was able to get the job

237
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,360
so don't let thinking you don't have all

238
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,300
the skills uh you know let it pass you

239
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,639
by on a job because you know you apply

240
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,919
so many times and maybe you apply that

241
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,120
one time the first time without the

242
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,820
skills maybe you wait five or six years

243
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,979
and unless you're you know applying

244
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,240
you're not going to get the job so I

245
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,458
highly recommend doing that there's so

246
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,320
many jobs out there needed and sometimes

247
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,060
your background kind of resonates with

248
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,500
that hiring manager so if you're a

249
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,360
assist admin or you worked on help desk

250
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,220
they can kind of relate and sometimes

251
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,680
that'll help you get fired let me get

252
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,680
hard not fired that's a different topic

253
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,680
yeah so uh just kind of cover some some

254
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,420
Basics here so what is pen testing so

255
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,519
pen testing is a sensing security from

256
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,740
an adversarial perspective the same way

257
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,360
a threat actor would use using the same

258
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,060
tools and techniques that they would use

259
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,860
uh and Pen testing is also the shorter

260
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,019
version of penetration tester and it's

261
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,339
also known as ethical hacking and

262
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,140
sometimes it's easier to explain people

263
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,899
ethical hacking although you would tell

264
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,580
some people sometimes I'm an ethical

265
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,080
hacker and they'll ask you is there

266
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
really such a thing as ethical hacker

267
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,380
they don't they don't realize that you

268
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,880
can do that I mean it's like having lock

269
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,519
picking skills you can do that for good

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,279
or bad but but pen testing or or hacking

271
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,640
seems to get kind of a bad rap

272
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,160
so as far as getting the experience you

273
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,540
know you need the knowledge but you need

274
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,940
the experience with the tools so taking

275
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,339
some different online courses like try

276
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:47,220
hack me the hack the Box uh you know

277
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,380
different ctfs and stuff learning how to

278
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,880
use the vulnerability scanners like the

279
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,860
oscp certification

280
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,720
I don't I don't know if they've updated

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,459
that where you can use vulnerability

282
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:57,899
scanners but they don't let you but in

283
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,160
real world you're using vulnerability

284
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,019
scanners so knowing how to use those

285
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,540
tools so using vulnerability scanners

286
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,600
you can download a 16 IP version of

287
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,220
nessus which is widely used in pen

288
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,260
testing you can download that you can

289
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,380
scan 16 IP addresses so you could do pen

290
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,120
tests for small companies your home lab

291
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,700
environment and 16 IPS is a pretty good

292
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,800
amount of ips to to learn how to use

293
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,720
nessus so get through there and get that

294
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,000
experience with that and also learn the

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
different pen testing Linux

296
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,959
distributions like Kali Linux and paired

297
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,180
OS and you can even build your own using

298
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
Ubuntu and install the tools but one of

299
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,140
the things I'll say is when you're using

300
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,120
one of these pre-built distros it's

301
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,440
easier to install the tools because

302
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,240
sometimes they do some tweaks to get

303
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,620
tools to work so if you're trying to

304
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,380
install something on Ubuntu there may be

305
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,260
some all sorts of missing python type

306
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,860
items in there like pip uh

307
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
add-ons to python to be able to install

308
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
with that you have to do all that so

309
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,140
sometimes it's easier and faster to use

310
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,360
Cali and pair it

311
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,459
and then pen testing tools nmap is one

312
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,440
of the most widely used tools you'll use

313
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
as a pen tester because there's even

314
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,519
nmap scripting engine scripts that will

315
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,339
perform vulnerability scanning whenever

316
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,740
I perform a pen test the first tool I

317
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,519
use to verify findings is uh nmap

318
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,079
because there's different nmap scripting

319
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
engines uh scripts that you can go

320
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,100
through there and validate certain

321
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,320
findings so if you go through a search

322
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,579
for that you can find that so you need

323
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,380
to when you're performing a pen test you

324
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,180
do vulnerability scanning you use other

325
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,620
tools to detect vulnerabilities but you

326
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,660
have to validate those findings and so

327
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,640
that's where nmap comes into play and

328
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,260
you can also do manual pen testing with

329
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,220
nmap

330
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,320
so there's like a volume script that's

331
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,200
just vuln that you can use in your nmap

332
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,320
scripting engine uh syntax when you run

333
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,820
your nmap scans you can find some of

334
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,959
these vulnerabilities

335
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,820
and so understanding how to use nmap is

336
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,260
very important

337
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,320
and then Metasploit is a very popular

338
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,820
exploit tool they have a free version

339
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,980
whereas a lot of the other exploitation

340
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,060
tools

341
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,800
like core impact some of those other

342
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,160
tools they don't have a free version so

343
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,959
Metasploit is widely used and you can do

344
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,160
pretty much everything with that you can

345
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,260
with metasploy professional when I've

346
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,519
worked in organizations where we had

347
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,940
Metasploit Pro I would stick with

348
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,680
metisplay framework since I was used to

349
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,420
the command line so understanding how to

350
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,459
use those tools you can download

351
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,740
metasploitable there's several different

352
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,420
versions of that metasploitable two and

353
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,139
three

354
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,760
are some of the best versions but the

355
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,560
good thing about metasploitable you're

356
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,079
able they've created those those uh VMS

357
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
originally so you could test Metasploit

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
against it and some companies will do

359
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
that also for their vulnerability

360
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,680
scanners they'll either have a

361
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,139
vulnerable website online or vulnerable

362
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,540
VMS you can download to practice using

363
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,120
their tool and the metasploitable VMS

364
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,980
they give you enough vulnerabilities

365
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,540
that are exploitable that would be equal

366
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,720
to uh numerous you know several

367
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,220
different VMS on your system that are

368
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,800
vulnerable so it takes up less disk

369
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,980
space and there are exploitable uh items

370
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,360
on there that you can use and you can

371
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
find some walkthroughs to learn how to

372
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,380
exploit those vulnerabilities

373
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,700
and there's a lot of other different

374
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,459
tools within Kali Linux that are very

375
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,800
helpful so as far as commercial tools

376
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
just to kind of learn this on your own

377
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,839
uh you've got burp Suite Community it

378
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:13,920
doesn't do some of the things but you

379
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,540
got a wasps app so you can use that so

380
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,680
there's a lot of functionality you can

381
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,839
get out of these free tools that you

382
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,160
don't have to have the paid tool to

383
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,440
learn those skills to get into the

384
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,360
industry and so also learning the web

385
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,240
app pen testing tools like burp Suite A

386
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,980
wasps app and web application

387
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,200
vulnerability scanners and one of the

388
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,019
things too is I really focus on if

389
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,880
you're wanting to get into pen testing

390
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,860
is really work on the web app pen

391
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,000
testing stuff because there's bug

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,459
bounties out there that's an easier way

393
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,040
to get real world experience and with

394
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,779
that experience and help you get a pen

395
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,399
testing job because you're able to

396
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,899
describe how you found vulnerabilities

397
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,079
even exploit them during an interview

398
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,699
back in 2020 I was looking for a new pen

399
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,519
testing job and I uh interviewed with a

400
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,860
very famous Boutique pen testing firm

401
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,540
and the hiring manager was telling me

402
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,459
that we have an easy time finding web

403
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,019
app pin testers because people are

404
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,519
participating in bug bounties they're

405
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,199
able to give that experience there's not

406
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,699
that much opportunity when it comes to

407
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,500
network pen testing that you're able to

408
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,240
find these opportunities some bug

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,620
bounties will have that but you don't

410
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,720
see that as often they usually have the

411
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,579
things that are you know

412
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,040
that you can test from the internet so

413
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,320
that makes it easier for them to test

414
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,120
so understanding that web app fantastic

415
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,339
piece so the pin testing skills it's

416
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,380
good to understand some networking you

417
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,779
don't have to be a CCNA but to be able

418
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,860
to set up your IP information within

419
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,220
your pen testing distribution

420
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,540
you know if it's an environment that

421
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,220
doesn't have DHCP you'll be able to know

422
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,660
how to statically assign or an IP

423
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,699
address to your your system

424
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,139
be able to understand routing and

425
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,120
subnetting enough so if you see an

426
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,079
environment you're going to understand

427
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,300
different subnets whether you're able to

428
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,000
test from that that VLAN or move to

429
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,639
others so you don't have to be a guru in

430
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,139
networking but you need to know some of

431
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,899
it and then operating systems you want

432
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,579
to understand operating systems like at

433
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,560
assist admin level because if you get a

434
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,019
shell to a system if you know Linux

435
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,699
you're able to do things on that system

436
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,100
to shut down services do further testing

437
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,899
if you understand windows and know the

438
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,519
right commands you may be able to shut

439
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,079
down a firewall so understanding that

440
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,959
from assist admin level is works out

441
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,339
great and one thing I'm saying now if

442
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,420
you're starting from you're just getting

443
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,920
started you don't have that experience

444
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
don't let overwhelm you know say I'm not

445
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,820
going to be able to learn how to pen

446
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,079
test I have all this stuff to learn

447
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,759
learn in parallel as you're learning

448
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,259
windows

449
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,820
you're learning Windows how to install

450
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,740
it learn how to secure it at the same

451
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,139
time learn how to exploit Windows as

452
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,220
you're going along so you don't have to

453
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,899
wait and get through all this and then

454
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,759
start the hacking piece kind of do it in

455
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,279
parallel as you're going along

456
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
so understanding the hacking and Pen

457
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,579
testing piece that's where I was at when

458
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,380
I got my first pen testing job

459
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,380
so uh platforms like hack the box and

460
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,420
try hack me are really good I really

461
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,800
like try hack me because it's very

462
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,660
beginner friendly they've got some basic

463
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,040
level stuff that you can go in there to

464
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,899
learn and it advances and and you gain

465
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,279
more advanced skills you go along but at

466
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,540
least it starts you at an easier level

467
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,839
some some platforms like offensive

468
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,579
security when they came out they were

469
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,220
more geared towards helping providing

470
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,959
certifications for people that were pen

471
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,279
testing so you had to be at a certain

472
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,500
level before you do that or there was a

473
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,660
lot of study to prepare for that and so

474
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,940
some of these they've gotten better with

475
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,500
some of their prerequisite training

476
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,440
materials for the oscp but things like

477
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,660
try hack me is very cheap and they've

478
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,160
got some free room so that's a good

479
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
place to get those hacking skills and

480
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,940
reverse engineering is a good skill to

481
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,860
have you know if you find like an

482
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,199
Android APK file on a network while

483
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,899
you're doing a pen test it may have some

484
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,620
ink some credentials that are contained

485
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,060
in there hard-coded credentials so maybe

486
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,100
they give out the APK you're able to

487
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,600
authenticate and you get access to the

488
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,100
system so look for those hard-coded

489
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,259
credentials uh any kind of database

490
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,940
information how to connect to databases

491
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,000
and uh Java files Java jar files can be

492
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,579
uh reverse engineered defined default

493
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,679
credentials database information other

494
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,780
things helpful on a pen test so the

495
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,939
reverse engineering is not as

496
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,380
complicated as it sounds you know

497
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,000
understandable Basics are coding just

498
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,579
looking even viewing the source of a web

499
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,859
page looking for maybe some uh

500
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,140
hard-coded credentials database

501
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,740
connection information sometimes in the

502
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,900
HTML hidden field sometimes there's good

503
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,980
information there that you can find

504
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,559
coding is and scripting

505
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,140
can be uh this is kind of not required

506
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,880
to get started but as you advance your

507
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,039
career you may want to do that because

508
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,480
if you're able to write your own tools

509
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,919
and scripts once you get to that

510
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,000
advanced level it's going to help you

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,559
progress in your career but when you're

512
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,640
starting out you don't have to do it I

513
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,440
see a lot of people that they want to

514
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
become a pen tester but they're going to

515
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,140
Learn Python first now start learning

516
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,960
and you can learn python along the way

517
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
and then also like mobile and device

518
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,020
Hardware if you're someone that really

519
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,520
understands that that may be a place for

520
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,559
you to get into but understanding uh

521
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,120
mobile devices you know especially how

522
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,580
some of the applications work because

523
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,100
the applications for mobile devices IOS

524
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,980
and Android are need to be pen tested if

525
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,480
some bug bounties actually include those

526
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,860
as well

527
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,960
and one of the things is too is there's

528
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,480
less talent in the mobile testing space

529
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,799
because a lot of things were kind of

530
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,120
slow for people that are already in the

531
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,880
field that maybe they were uh

532
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,679
you know start out pen testing and they

533
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,440
totally didn't train on cloud or some of

534
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,820
these other devices mobile testing they

535
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,960
have to go back and do it later so

536
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,539
sometimes these newer technologies that

537
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,360
are not so new now maybe like cloud and

538
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,160
mobile learn that because a lot of the

539
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
experienced professionals don't have

540
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
skills in that area I mean I've worked

541
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,760
on 15 people uh pen testing teams at a

542
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,500
bank and there was only like maybe two

543
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,700
or three of us and you have to do mobile

544
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,380
pen testing and sometimes it's not

545
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,120
always that's up to you to learn on your

546
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,380
own and sometimes you don't get the

547
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,280
opportunities to do that in

548
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,539
organizations but so if you're really

549
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,640
trying to break in learn that some of

550
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,260
the upcoming Technologies or some things

551
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,360
that are really hot now is API knowing

552
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,799
how to API pin test because that's

553
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,080
another one that says not as many skills

554
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,360
at that as well as even getting into

555
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,700
some of the the web 3 stuff some of the

556
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,000
blockchain pen testing and stuff

557
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,100
Beau Bullock from Black Hills he's got

558
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,320
some information out there on uh be able

559
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,820
to pen test blockchain so as we move

560
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,679
towards that understanding those

561
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,480
Technologies and kind of start learning

562
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,559
that if you're just starting out you

563
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,200
learn how to pen test blockchain 90

564
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,480
let's say probably 95 pen testers out

565
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,220
there don't know how to do that so that

566
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,799
could be your your step to get into uh

567
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,900
pen testing and also some of those more

568
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,059
complex areas like that could be a lot

569
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,580
more interesting to learn as well

570
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,440
and so getting the pen pen testing

571
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,620
experience so bug bounties are

572
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,840
crowdsourced pen testing so like bug

573
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,580
crowds synac

574
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,460
hacker one Integrity are really good

575
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,080
ones to start out with I heard Integrity

576
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,400
is probably one of the better platforms

577
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
because there's not as many people on it

578
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,419
get out there get the experience if

579
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,220
you're not finding bugs

580
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,840
that you actually can write up that you

581
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,039
get credit for

582
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,020
if you find duplicates you're still

583
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,179
finding vulnerabilities think about you

584
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,260
know you're able to go through a job

585
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,120
interview and you're able to tell the

586
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,880
hiring manager how you found cross-life

587
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,220
scripting or SQL injection during these

588
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,200
vulnerabilities so that's actual real

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,520
world experience so that's something

590
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,620
that you can put on your resume and so

591
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,600
pen testing is a service

592
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,580
uh is a little different what they do

593
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,799
with pen testing and service Cobalt

594
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,780
offers that synack bug crowd and hacker

595
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,460
one I believe added that and so what

596
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,260
they do is uh some of these I think

597
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,640
synag may be able to pay a little better

598
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,400
but like Cobalt you get 1500 to perform

599
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
a pen test so whether you find bugs or

600
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,240
not you're getting paid

601
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,799
and this is real world pen testing

602
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,059
experience you get that experience you

603
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,400
do that for six months to a year then

604
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,679
you go apply for a full-time pin testing

605
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,299
job and you'll make a lot more money

606
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,520
fifteen hundred dollars a week is not

607
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,400
much as a pen tester but once you you

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,500
know once you get those skills it's easy

609
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,179
to make six figures working as a pen

610
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,520
tester as an internal resource but this

611
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,740
is the way you get experience because

612
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,600
you know back years ago you didn't have

613
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,919
these opportunities to get that

614
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,840
experience you just had to get lucky

615
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,940
like I did and get hired by someone

616
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,799
willing to give you a chance so these

617
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,260
are good ways to get experience uh pro

618
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,419
bono pen testing so any non-profits or

619
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:14,159
religious organizations you could

620
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,620
perform free pen test for them and even

621
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,840
not only pro bono you can do low cost

622
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,520
pen testing maybe you're making a little

623
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,559
bit of money they can't afford to pay

624
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,980
you know someone like Black Hills or uh

625
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,260
trust is secular pen test you know if

626
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,640
you charge that I've seen people that

627
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,159
were doing a pen test for a non-profit

628
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,200
that was charging a thousand dollars for

629
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,900
in one week that's very fair compared to

630
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,400
what you know consulting company is

631
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,299
going to charge

632
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,460
and so common vulnerabilities and

633
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,799
exposures cves getting cve numbers on

634
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,659
your resume is good because there's a

635
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,460
lot of pen testers out there that don't

636
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,280
have cves I don't have any CVS if I

637
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,960
could have figured out how to if I would

638
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
have been the right place to record my

639
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,280
my iPhone screen I was able to find a

640
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,380
bypass one time back when Apple was

641
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,179
still on the touch screen without using

642
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,679
the home button to get in I was able to

643
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,480
do it and apple said yeah you need to

644
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,220
record it with a camera or something and

645
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,140
every time I be out at a stoplight it

646
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,059
would come up a pop-up would show up I'd

647
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,220
go touch it and it would open up and I'm

648
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,299
away from home I couldn't get a camera

649
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,679
so I was never ever to get it but

650
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,179
regardless that was like the only

651
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,679
closest I'd come to getting CV but

652
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,419
there's a lot of people that don't have

653
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:19,559
them because they had certifications

654
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,020
they got in so CBE is a big thing and

655
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,659
Joe Helly if you heard of Joe Helly he

656
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,100
goes by the mayor

657
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,679
he started uh playing around with

658
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,840
finding cves and he's able to find a lot

659
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,059
of them and so if you look on medium he

660
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,520
has an article called how I was born how

661
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
I was born one night

662
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
and found two uh cves and what he

663
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,640
recommends is downloading some of this

664
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,220
free and open source hotel booking

665
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,380
software just different free softwares

666
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,179
download in your environment install it

667
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,980
and find the bugs and then write it up

668
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,140
you get cves on there that's going to go

669
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,120
a long ways towards helping you get the

670
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,100
job some cases some hiring managers

671
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,440
would hire someone for cves over they

672
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
would like a oscp or some other

673
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,100
certification because this is going

674
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,600
showing you something you did in real

675
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,140
world opposed to an environment used for

676
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,900
for testing your security skills and one

677
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,100
of the things too when mentioning the

678
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,960
bug bounties and stuff once you get

679
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,440
those skills uh sign up for Cobalt go on

680
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,640
there and what they do is they'll give

681
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,280
you a an assessment they give you like a

682
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,539
vulnerable VM or a vulnerable

683
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,400
environment or application that you have

684
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,260
to perform a pen test against and if you

685
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,159
do good enough you're going to get

686
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
recruited so if you've got the skills to

687
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,419
do that it's what you're gaining through

688
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,580
all your your learning you'll be able to

689
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,080
sign up and get on with them like I said

690
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
they're paying 1500 uh per pen test for

691
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,360
like 35 hours of work and that's pretty

692
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,740
decent side money and then once you get

693
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,940
the experience you can move on to full

694
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,120
time

695
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,960
and so uh

696
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,419
further information how to get the

697
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,820
experience the simulated experience you

698
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,900
know we were talking about bug bounties

699
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
Real World Experience so ctfs are still

700
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,580
good ways to get experience uh if you're

701
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,220
in college national cyber league is like

702
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,059
a national uh competition it's a CTF and

703
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,400
they take the The rosters of people and

704
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,140
rankings and employers will ask for that

705
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,279
information hire people for that

706
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,620
database if you're in a college that

707
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,380
does the the the red team blue team

708
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,539
games the CCDC

709
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,820
competing in those hiring managers will

710
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,940
hire from that so hack the Box try hack

711
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,140
me getting experience in those

712
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,760
environments you know if you've got a

713
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,679
really good ranking somewhere on one of

714
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,600
those platforms that's good to have and

715
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,820
then a home lab using vulnerable VMS I

716
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,980
used to really stress that a lot but

717
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,039
with all these other online platforms I

718
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,480
think that's probably a better way to go

719
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
because

720
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
some of the vulnerable applications you

721
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,720
find online are more real world Juice

722
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,279
Shop is another good one you can

723
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,940
actually can uh the Heroku cloud service

724
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,460
you can go to Heroku and install your

725
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,159
own Juice Shop instance and test across

726
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,320
the internet there so using these ctfs

727
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,880
try hack me and hack the Box are really

728
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,100
great ways to get experience try hack me

729
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,440
to hack the box also has a lot of great

730
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,980
education material uh hack the box kind

731
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,200
of took a page from what Tri Hackney was

732
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
doing and started their Academy so

733
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,440
there's a really good way to learn learn

734
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,299
those environments home labs are good

735
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,279
but there's all the stuff built that you

736
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,500
don't have to spend the time building

737
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,940
your home Labs at one time that was

738
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,980
really pretty much your only option but

739
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,799
now with those those uh resources you're

740
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,080
able to do that

741
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,080
and so how to Showcase that experience

742
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,539
so when you're doing these hack the Box

743
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,240
rooms and try hack me and all this and

744
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,000
CTS write those up write an article on

745
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
medium as long as it's like hack the Box

746
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,260
you're able to disclose and do write-ups

747
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,240
there may be some vulnerable VMS they

748
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,159
don't want that disclosed but she can

749
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
even do this privately so you could have

750
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,740
a GitHub account or medium or whatever

751
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,200
the blog platform and you can do like

752
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,640
write-ups on the vulnerabilities you

753
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,620
found even if you're doing bug bounties

754
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,320
you know write up some of the findings

755
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,580
you may want to redact it to make sure

756
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,380
they'll see the customer information but

757
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,640
write these up and you can actually

758
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,279
prove it goes a long way of proving you

759
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
know what you're doing and that you can

760
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
communicate that and communication

761
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,799
skills sometimes are lacking you take

762
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,659
some of the best hackers and they're not

763
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:13,860
really good at writing you know we're

764
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,600
living a world where you're sending text

765
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,460
messages you're sending acronyms not

766
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,440
completing full sentences so those

767
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,720
communication skills are great so if

768
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,400
you're able to go medium or write these

769
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,460
up even do like you YouTube videos on

770
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,679
these walkthroughs in these rooms if

771
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,880
there's been a lot of people that have

772
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,220
built their careers as content creators

773
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,620
you look at the Cyber Mentor Heath Adams

774
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,260
he was learning and did a lot of his

775
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,299
education to to train to teach himself

776
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,059
made all these videos and now he's got a

777
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,500
pen testing company been working as a

778
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,580
pen tester

779
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,200
Kelly certifications offering

780
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,179
certifications but he started out as a

781
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,380
content creator

782
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,539
and now it's such a great environment

783
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,039
for that there's a lot of other people I

784
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,159
don't know if any of you uh know who

785
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,620
Michael Patrick or Fearless from uh

786
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,940
infosec Twitter

787
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,059
he uh networked in the in the industry

788
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,919
and that's how he got in and also

789
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,779
finding cves that helped him get a job

790
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,659
and so GitHub to display scripts so if

791
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,799
you're writing any scripts so if you're

792
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,299
creating some automation for some of

793
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,740
these these different platforms you're

794
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,900
working on put those scripts in in that

795
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,159
GitHub so that way it goes to show

796
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,840
you're doing things you know because you

797
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,220
can go in some place you say you're

798
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,659
doing all this stuff but if you can

799
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,039
prove it you're gonna it's gonna go a

800
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,779
long long way for helping you and your

801
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,059
efforts to get a job so you see a lot of

802
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,080
people that are experienced

803
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,880
professionals with the GitHub out there

804
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,580
if writing is your thing right you know

805
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,960
you can do write-ups or on different uh

806
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,419
ctfs even your overall review of like

807
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,640
the Sans challenge that they do each

808
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,740
December write that stuff up people see

809
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,840
that and they'll find you because social

810
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,100
media

811
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,679
YouTube all those platforms the more

812
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,059
people know who you are the easier you

813
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,399
can find a job for me now whenever I got

814
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,559
started out uh you know when I got

815
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,720
started security there wasn't Twitter

816
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,240
LinkedIn has started out but now if you

817
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,799
get on social media you go to

818
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,620
conferences and network with folks it's

819
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,600
able to get you in there and so creating

820
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,700
videos and writing blog posts is a

821
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,039
really good way to get uh

822
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,640
experience and showcase your talents and

823
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,140
with the nice thing about Medium as a

824
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,820
platform people that are interested in

825
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,159
the same subject as you will find your

826
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,600
write-ups and stuff and another prime

827
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,760
example of someone that really took off

828
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
too is Ronnie Khalil have you seen any

829
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,140
of her oscp write-ups and videos and

830
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,880
stuff she also does a lot of good

831
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,860
content for Port swiger's web

832
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,020
application Security Academy she does

833
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,000
write-ups and videos on that and so that

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,260
really got her a lot of exposure and

835
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,820
those people can go anywhere get a job

836
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,740
anytime so you may not have the

837
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,779
experience yet but if you can demo that

838
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,299
on a display you know on a video I've

839
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,100
seen people do talks at conferences and

840
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,919
local meetups I saw recent college grad

841
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,380
at one of our local Defcon groups did a

842
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,779
talk on malware analysis analysis A

843
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,120
hiring manager from city was at and the

844
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,039
off in the audience and asked for his

845
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,480
resume he already saw his technical

846
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,059
skills through his presentation so just

847
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,559
getting out there if it's even a smaller

848
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,659
platform in meetups or either going

849
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,460
online through social media those are

850
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,020
really great ways to

851
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,480
to get that uh exposure out there and

852
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,220
display what you're not what you're uh

853
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,960
what you're learning and on your resume

854
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,760

855
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,159

856
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,740
platforms you're on try hack me and hack

857
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,240
the Box talk about the different rooms

858
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,279

874
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,460
you go to my YouTube channel I have a

875
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,700
whole semester's worth of my pen testing

876
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,279
lectures and the the book was based on

877
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,000
the pen Test Plus but in those videos I

878
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,760
do some some hacking demos as well to

879
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,080
share my real world pen testing

880
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,279
experience when I started the class

881
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,980
we're using Georgia weedman's book as a

882
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,380
textbook but then we the pen Test Plus

883
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,299
came out that year and I wanted to be

884
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,919
able to offer my students a way to get a

885
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,360
certification so we moved over to pen

886
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,799
Test Plus

887
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,779
so like I said that lectures if you go

888
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,840
in there there's a um a uh playlist on

889
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,039
there with all those lectures for the

890
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,960
pen test plus I just talked to someone

891
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,820
recently that it passed the pen Test

892
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,679
Plus certification and they said that

893
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,179
the videos actually helped them in their

894
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,360
their certification process

895
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,179
and so that concludes my presentation

896
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,559
but I'm happy to answer any questions

897
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,220
that you may have

898
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,460
and for our audience at home if someone

899
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,919
asks questions

900
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,760
before you answer it yes so

901
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,279
here's the pen test God ask the question

902
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,840
I may not be the guy but I'm the person

903
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,519
I help people get in the industry

904
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,740
because it's interesting I have uh my

905

906
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,940
really like helping people get

907
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,740
into the industry so

908
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,720
so definitely good at helping people get

909
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,820
started so did you have a question

910
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,080

either way I'm always happy to connect

919
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,659
with people one of my favorite things

920
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:37,980
that come to these conferences getting

921
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,419
to meet my friends in person to meet new

922
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,919
people yes

923
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:43,200
yeah

924
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,960
what do you want me to it's a mic or no

925
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,299
you just do just ask question and he'll

926
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,820
repeat it sorry we're limited careers

927
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,279
most challenging and I'd say probably

928
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,600
one of the most challenging pieces was

929
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,039
when I was first getting into cyber

930
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,080
security once I had that base level

931
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,940
experience and one of the things too if

932
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,200
you're working other areas of security

933
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,880
it's not going to be difficult to move

934
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,799
into other areas of security but first

935
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,720
getting into security because I had my

936
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,179
cissp I had some of the domains I'd

937
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,220
worked in physical security I used to

938
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,919
help work for a company doing CAD that

939
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,779
uh designed prison systems security

940
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,299
systems so I had that but uh just

941
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,320
getting your foot in the door and

942
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,240
sometimes if you're working for a

943
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,399
company you're an I.T or maybe in other

944
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,860
areas of company in other areas of the

945
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,360
company try to move into those different

946
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,399
groups get to know the the people in the

947
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,899
pen test team or the security team that

948
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,640
you want to move into you know go out

949
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,260
there and and network with those folks

950
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,580
sometimes they may let you Shadow them

951
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,440
some companies have programs so they'll

952
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,480
let people Shadow other people in I.T or

953
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,220
security but that's the more difficult

954
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,960
thing and so the question was someone

955
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
asked uh what was the most difficult

956
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,700
thing getting to change careers

957
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,039
and and one thing to realize in changing

958
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,860
careers conferences like this are really

959
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,620
excellent for that because especially if

960
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,860
you participate in any of the ctfs or

961
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,679
any of the pros versus Joe's

962
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,539
being able to network with the people

963
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,399
that you're competing against or that

964
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,159
you're collaborating with really you

965
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,440
know you you are learning that you can

966
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,299
work with those people and then you find

967
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,760
out where they work or that they can

968
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,380
recommend you because I can tell you

969
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,740
more than 80 85 percent of jobs are

970
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,159
filled through referrals so network of

971
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,200
an event if you've followed someone on

972
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,820
Twitter and you finally get to meet them

973
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,399
building these relationships in the

974
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,220
community is not just you know one tweet

975
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,399
one dm one slack message it is a

976
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,100
layering and meeting people following

977
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,679
them engaging on Twitter engaging and

978
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,019
Linkedin in a respectful manner is a

979
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:47,220
really great way to build your

980
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,320
Connections in another industry question

981
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,039
okay

982
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
yes

983
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,120
uh probably LinkedIn

984
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,399
yeah someone asked what was the the best

985
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,140
medium to reach out to me for mentoring

986
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,740
and I said uh medium I mean LinkedIn so

987
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,540
yeah I do that a lot all I do a lot of

988
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,219
cases and one thing I recommend too if

989
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,079
you're looking for mentors you don't

990
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,820
have to have one specific person to take

991
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,139
care of all of it find several people

992
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,520
you can go to because people have

993
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,379
different experiences and can help you

994
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,300
out so one of the things I do is I never

995
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,460
turn away people I Mentor but what I'll

996
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,440
do in a lot of cases I'm able to provide

997
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,060
someone with enough information they go

998
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,320
off and study and learn and then they

999
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,399
come back later on when they have other

1000
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,099
questions so yeah if anyone wants needs

1001
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,560
someone to Mentor advice you know a lot

1002
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,300
of times I'll you know message through

1003
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,219
DMs or we can set up a zoom call I'd be

1004
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,139
happy to Mentor people and give your

1005
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,399
advice because one thing is I get a lot

1006
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,260
of people coming to me wanting because

1007
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,699
from when I was teaching people always

1008
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,020
came to me looking for entry level pen

1009
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,300
testers and I not only recommend my

1010
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,520
students other people I knew if I knew

1011
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,719
their skills knew how to do certain

1012
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,540
things I'd recommend them and I love to

1013
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,359
refer people actually uh at my former

1014
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,339
company I'd referred seven people while

1015
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,280
I worked there seven people

1016
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,000
so

1017
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,000
so one a mentor mentee relationship

1018
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,760
because they should stand closer Mentor

1019
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,220
mentee relationship is a two-way

1020
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,980
responsibility and relationship don't

1021
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,380
just ask someone can you Mentor me have

1022
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,420
three specific things that you want to

1023
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,700
get from that person and three things

1024
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,380
that you're going to be able to provide

1025
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,380
them back it is not all take take it is

1026
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,940
give and take

1027
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,040
that's not the only one on this stage

1028
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,619
that's over 60 and I can tell you when I

1029
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,119
was starting my career there were no

1030
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,359
women in an executive position so there

1031
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,940
is something called virtual or ghosting

1032
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,300
mentoring I just found people on Twitter

1033
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,480
on LinkedIn on social media that I

1034
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,940
really liked who they were

1035
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,460
professionally and personally integrity

1036
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,680
and I just sort of sort of stalked them

1037
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,540
you know that's how we connected through

1038
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,800
Twitter we stopped each other so realize

1039
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,839
that you can stalk someone in a

1040
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,560
respectful way follow what they write

1041
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,560
read what they post engage with them a

1042
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,240
little bit it was really sort of

1043
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,980
gratifying to me I work in the

1044
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,700
Government Contracting space and one of

1045
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,400
the people that I was stalking became

1046
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,099
the first female CIO for the government

1047
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,339
for GSA and I went to her and I thanked

1048
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,400
her for being my you know sort of mentor

1049
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,079
and she turned around and said well

1050
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,560
you've been mine so it was one of those

1051
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,020
wonderful moment so another question

1052
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,280
in the back Josh

1053
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
um

1054
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,500
yes the question was how if you get go

1055
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,820
through all these steps to learn this

1056
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,940
how do you get past HR to be able to get

1057
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,640
into hiring managers and so one of the

1058
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,020
things I say there's your networking is

1059
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
really going to be helpful going to your

1060
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,740
different meetup groups because I and

1061
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,780
the thing is a lot of people refer to it

1062
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,820
as the HR firewall because sometimes

1063
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,200
they don't understand you can have some

1064
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,180
certification that's just as good but

1065
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,200
they don't understand if they got a

1066
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,119
written up job description and they're

1067
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,380
fitting to that so if you know someone

1068
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,079
in the company you know I hear a lot of

1069
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,339
people sometimes if they see someone

1070
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,780
they're connecting to LinkedIn maybe

1071
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,920
I'll know them that well maybe they'll

1072
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
message them and say hey I'm interested

1073
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,099
in a job in your company could you pass

1074
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:37,260
my resume on a lot of cases people will

1075
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,820
do that and so that's the biggest thing

1076
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,680
is directly connecting with people a

1077
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,720
prime example here is I work for U.S

1078
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,660
bank and uh I got the job there but

1079
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,700
around the same time I applied for a job

1080
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,820
at Bank of America you know kind of same

1081
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,099
type of company same type of uh

1082
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,619
experience and so forth I applied online

1083
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,720
I didn't hear from them until a year

1084
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,240
later I knew some one I got referred to

1085
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,280
U.S Bank and I got a job offer and it

1086
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,040
was like a very minimal process I got

1087
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,260
the interview two interviews and I got

1088
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,780
the job otherwise like U.S you know if

1089
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,460
I'd applied online it might have been

1090
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,040
the same scenario because a lot of times

1091
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,200
HR uh unless you find someone like

1092
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,240
Kathleen as far as recruiters some

1093
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,859
recruiters don't understand that space

1094
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,619
so the more people you can get to refer

1095
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,359
you get to know those people

1096
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:26,760
and do that and sometimes like even for

1097
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,220
me if you're looking for a job I will

1098
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,599
share for people share of people's

1099
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,700
profiles say Hey you know Jason's

1100
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,619
looking for a job he's looking for a pen

1101
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:35,880
tester rolling your little pen tester

1102
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,220
role this is experience tag them in it

1103
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,020
and that way they get the response and

1104
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,240
the you know the value of of my

1105
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,700
connections to help them get the job

1106
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,260
but yeah just make sure your the

1107
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,119
networking piece is very important I

1108
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,320
don't I don't even really you know

1109
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,640
really have to go through recruiters

1110
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,260
anymore just because my network

1111
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,940
networking with people and one of the

1112
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,460
things I have to say too go past just

1113
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,839
the connecting with someone don't just

1114
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,579
connect and forget about it maintain

1115
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,520
those those uh relationships because I'm

1116
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,560
at conferences I'll see people that run

1117
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,760
conferences

1118
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,339
they're they're like at Texas cyber

1119
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,920
Summit I'd run into sciatic nerd that

1120
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,260
runs besides San Antonio we would talk

1121
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,180
and I would get asked to do a workshop

1122
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,859
or other opportunities would come up

1123
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,839
because I was talking to someone that

1124
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,339
runs Hue setcon so when you see those

1125
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,500
people make sure to talk to them

1126
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,480
periodically just say hi and and

1127
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,099
sometimes meet people for coffee when

1128
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,079
they're in town like we've we've been up

1129
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,000
before

1130
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,560
so yeah just constantly connect and just

1131
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,000
keep those relationships going because

1132
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,460
you know people will forget about you

1133
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,839
after a while but if you maintain those

1134
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,000
relationships opportunities just

1135
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,780
constantly keep coming

1136
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,280
yes the question was uh if I had

1137
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,619
experience with purple teaming and

1138
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,140
balancing the red team with the incident

1139
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,359
response so really the thing is you have

1140
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,680
to really make sure that you're

1141
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,359
communicating and this is a group effort

1142
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,339
uh the one company I'll work for we're

1143
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,980
doing purple teaming it was a really

1144
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,560
good process because the The Defenders

1145
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,300
incident response were really interested

1146
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,599
in seeing in these exercises because one

1147
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,040
of the best ways to mature your your

1148
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,839
organization because you can perform pen

1149
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,880
test vulnerability scans and go through

1150
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,700
those iterations and remediate and you

1151
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,140
can't constantly be pen testing normally

1152
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,520
you don't have resources but if you're

1153
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,780
able to run purple team and you're able

1154
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,339
to take tools out of the hands of

1155
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,839
attackers like mimikats different

1156
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,099
Powershell scripts uh risky Powershell

1157
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,079
hygiene and the environment so the

1158
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,880
experience I had was at a large Global

1159
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,140
consumer company it was a really good

1160
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,900
experience the I would say probably the

1161
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,440
the IR folks and and Defenders were more

1162
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,300
interested in the what than the the red

1163
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,540
team

1164
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,079
and there's some really good scripts out

1165
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,000
there like a

1166
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,140
Atomic red team has their Canary has the

1167
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,420
atomic red team scripts and some of

1168
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,980
those are scriptures you can run they

1169
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,300
don't have payloads so like you can run

1170
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,800
mimikats and it does have a payload it

1171
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,599
just has that signature so you can cut

1172
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,339
down the risk in your environment and

1173
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,359
that's good too if you're wanting to

1174
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
bring in junior level pen testers or red

1175
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,200
teamers to let them use those tools

1176
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,700
safely in the in that environment

1177
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,660
up here

1178
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,660
and

1179
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,960
I need advice on how to

1180
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,180
important

1181
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,560
purely uh

1182
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,740
okay yeah someone said they had QA

1183
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,280
experience on the UA UA or UI ux side

1184
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,040
and there's one of how to get they work

1185
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,660
in the different Sprints for the

1186
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,400
software development life cycle and how

1187
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,380
to get pen test experience I would say

1188
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,180
familiar if you haven't familiarized

1189
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,760
yourself with like the OAS top 10 and

1190
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,800
use like the oauth testing guide start

1191
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,900
learning web app pen testing because one

1192
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,819
of the things too organizations will a

1193
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:13,680
lot of times have their app SEC folks or

1194
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,040
their uh

1195
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,480
devsecops will be performing Das you

1196
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,819
know they're scanning and static code

1197
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:22,319
analysis through that process but

1198
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,119
sometimes they're running pen testing so

1199
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,500
if you're able to learn pen testing

1200
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,900
there may be an organization in your in

1201
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,839
your in your company that does the pen

1202
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,040
testing after you go through that

1203
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,660
process but if you're able to do some

1204
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,339
testing maybe even learn how to retest

1205
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,220
those items after a pen test if you go

1206
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,079
back and retest those things to see if

1207
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,099
they're vulnerable to make sure you're

1208
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,020
remediated before they go back to the

1209
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,940
pen test team to retest that's a way for

1210
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,220
you to get those skills and working in

1211
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,599
your area I've known several people work

1212
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,760
in QA that have moved into application

1213
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,119
security or web app pin testing so learn

1214
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,240
those skills and ports wiggers uh web

1215
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,920
applications Security Academy is a great

1216
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,440
place to learn it's all free content

1217
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,599
and they show you how to use burp Suite

1218
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,640
which is a very popular industry tool

1219
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,440
that's good to use so I would start with

1220
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,900
that resource and oh watch top 10 oh

1221
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,520
watch testing guide kind of learn those

1222
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
and once people know you can do that

1223
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,060
they're going to get you to to test it

1224
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,619
because maybe they want to they need to

1225
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,119
retest it right now but the pen test

1226
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,220
team is not available for you know a

1227
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,480
couple weeks or a month you're able to

1228
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,980
test right away so that's a good way to

1229
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,780
get in there and once they see that if

1230
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,339
they need someone in that group they may

1231
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:28,800
recruit you over so

1232
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,460
good question

1233
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,488
