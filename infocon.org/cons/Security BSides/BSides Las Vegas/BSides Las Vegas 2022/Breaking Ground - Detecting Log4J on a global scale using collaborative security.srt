volunteers and staff this event truly

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
would not be possible

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,279
uh and and i think i share the same

16
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,560
sentiment with a bunch of other people

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,119
that i'm glad that this event in person

18
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,480

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,719
um so hopefully this just go uphill from

20
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,600
here

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,880

little bit fast but please do speak into

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
the mic because otherwise the people

52
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
online would not be able to hear your

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
question and we really don't want that

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360

55
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,079
i'm taus

58
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,720
welcome to my talk on detecting log4k on

59
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
a global scale using collaborative

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,040
security

61
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
but before but before we start this is

62
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719
my first talk in vegas

63
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,439
so

64
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,920
that's i'm really happy about that

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,719
um

66
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
but i'm of course i'm mostly i'm most

67
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
happy that about the fact that my first

68
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719
talk will be at b-sides because we all

69
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,959
know b-side is always the nicest crowd

70
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
that's that's how it is

71
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
in the at blackhead they would have

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,800
killed me so

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
but um yeah another thing i want to say

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
before we start is that um

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
the first thing the best thing that

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
happened in my professional career was

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
when i got fired

78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
uh a year and a half ago from one of the

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,040
biggest danish retailers

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
online retails

81
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
and that's relevant because

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
if i hidden if i hadn't then i probably

83
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
wouldn't have been here today

84
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
i've been an infrastruct professional

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
for almost 20 years and

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
i don't know about you guys but i just

87
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
never came around to finding out what i

88
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200
wanted to do for the rest of my

89
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,920
professional career but i did find out

90
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,319
some at some point that what i liked

91
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
best about my professional career about

92
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,239
my job was all the things that i did in

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,840
my spare time

94
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
which is uh i've always been involved in

95
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
old west i've been active an active

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,879
member of overs copenhagen for

97
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
13 years some 14 years sorry

98
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
and i'm co-founding besides copenhagen

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
and what i what i've loved about that

100
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
and and always have loved about is

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
arranging events and gathering people

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
and see in their eyes that i've had a

103
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
wonderful time and and helping them out

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
and and that's really what i wanted to

105
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,159
do and at some point i was so lucky at

106
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,560
that to find out that there are people

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,319
out there who does this for a living

108
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,120
they

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,959
interact with the community they give

110
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
back to the community which i love to do

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,159
of course

112
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
and help them out and and eventually i

113
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,840
found crowdstick or crafts they found me

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,440
depending on how you look at how you

115
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,519
look upon it and now i have the greatest

116
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,640
job in the world

117
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
so that's it

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
um

119
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,400
first a little bit of background about

120
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
how krauser works because if you if you

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
don't understand just a little bit about

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
how it works then you won't be able to

123
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
understand the data and and understand

124
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,159
and appreciate uh the method

125
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,080
around log4j that i will be talking

126
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
about later

127
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,400
um i won't be going into details

128
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
this is as high levels as i could do it

129
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,040
but

130
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
let's start with the beginning the

131
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
beginning is that

132
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,159
as a cyber secure professional or at

133
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
least cyber security interested you know

134
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
there's something wrong out there right

135
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,918
there are people out there spending

136
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,040
a gazillion dollars on on cyber security

137
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
and they're still getting breached

138
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
so something is clearly up i mean what

139
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
it seems like the whole world has agreed

140
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,479
that

141
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
if you just throw enough money into a

142
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
big bottomless pit

143
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
then everything is going to going to be

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,479
all right except it's not all right

145
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,800
that's evident for everyone right

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
so

147
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,320
our point is and and the reason why

148
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
crowdstick is around is why don't we try

149
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,800
something else

150
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
for instance we tried outpowering the

151
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
bad guys we tried outsmarting the bad

152
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
guys

153
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
why don't we try and

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,720
empower them

155
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
because if you think of it

156
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,320
there are more

157
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,120
of regular people like like us

158
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
than criminals so why don't we work

159
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
together and get those bastards right

160
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
why don't we do that and

161
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,080
then that is basically what crowdstay

162
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,919
games should do

163
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
but what does this mean in practice

164
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
you can think of prosthetic as the ways

165
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
of cyber security and if you don't know

166
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,120
waze waste is a gps app

167
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
that basically collects information

168
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,240
about

169
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,479
how fast your car is going if there's

170
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,360
any

171
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
any accidents or any or any road repairs

172
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
or anything around you so and sharing it

173
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
with everyone else so that everyone has

174
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
an efficient trip as possible

175
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,120
the crowdstick does kind of like the

176
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
same

177
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
in that crowdsack detects locks

178
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
or sorry cardstock read locks

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,160
on the service you're running

180
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
uh in it and it and it detects um

181
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
it takes those threats um and then and

182
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
mitigates them afterwards and there are

183
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
a number of way different ways to

184
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
mitigate

185
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
um then it sends signals back uh on the

186
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
attacks i disease back to our data lake

187
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,560
thing

188
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,880
and after that it's being there all the

189
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
ips are being assessed and turned into a

190
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
block list and shared with with the rest

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
of the community

192
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,560
and that happens that happens

193
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
automatically

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,800
um

195
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
yep

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,319
carson can detect a number of different

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,199
attacks crowd caustic was originally i

198
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,280
guess meant to replace fails or ban

199
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
filter ban only does brute force attacks

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
and that's so that's fine but crosstalk

201
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
can detect a lot of

202
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
other things on

203
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
things on layer seven for instance the

204
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
log4j that we'll be talking about and

205
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
that's in that

206
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
in that sense kraft second reads the the

207
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,880
web server log and it detects

208
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
those special strings uh

209
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
it's not uh ai or ml it's basically rule

210
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
based and and the

211
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
log passing and the log scenario uh file

212
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
consists consists of some part of of

213
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
grog which then passes a log file

214
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,199
and based on that it detects the text

215
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,840
and and sends them back like i described

216
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,759
before crowdsack

217
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
this is relatively current stats so that

218
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
will be saying we collect around 1.6

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
million

220
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,599
signals a day

221
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,000
we have around 4 million ips in what we

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
call the smoke database which is three

223
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,360
days of of bad guys

224
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
and there's around 20 to 30 thousand ips

225
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
in this curated block list that i talked

226
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
about before

227
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
and in a later shot i'll i'll be talking

228
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
a bit more about

229
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
the strengths of the caster network

230
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
meaning how how big a number are we

231
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
talking about

232
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
but before that it's important to

233
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
understand that krausteg is free and

234
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
open source

235
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
and the license we chose for making the

236
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
open source is called

237
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,280
is the mit license and

238
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,080
the whole point of that is that once

239
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
you have open source something during

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
the mi with the mit license

241
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
then it's not possible to close the

242
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,520
source again and crosstake being a

243
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,479
startup

244
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
there is a risk or change or possibility

245
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
that some big company wants to acquire

246
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,520
us and maybe they want to close the

247
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,560
source

248
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,280
uh

249
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
we we will do what we can to prevent

250
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,639
that because

251
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,919
crowdstick is nothing without the

252
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,720
community we don't want to screw it over

253
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
so instead we sort of set up like a fair

254
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
deal at least we think

255
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
software is free to use

256
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
and if you want the block list you share

257
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
your own signals and if you don't well

258
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,760
then you don't get the signals but

259
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,080
crosstalk still works crowdsake is still

260
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,599
able to partial log detect attack and

261
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
stuff like that you just don't get any

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
signals from everyone else

263
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
a question that's that i often get asked

264
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
is what about privacy

265
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
and especially when we're used to

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
as a security personnel hating

267
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,000
everything that's free on the internet

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,959
because that means that you're the

269
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,920
product

270
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,519
in this case you're not the product

271
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
because honestly we don't care about you

272
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
we care about the bad guys so what we're

273
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
so what crosstalk is collecting is

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
literally just a an offending ip a

275
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
source ip

276
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
a timestamp and like a behavior behavior

277
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
is like a scenario that describes what's

278
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
going on for instance like ssh brute

279
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,360
forcing or

280
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,320
credit card stuffing or whatever

281
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
this that's the only thing that's being

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
um that's been recorded

283
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
cardstick doesn't send your lock

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
anywhere

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
and also if some of them if some of you

286
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
are from europe we have something called

287
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,839
gdpr

288
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,760
which basically means that

289
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,680
that we have to have a dpo a data

290
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
protection officer we have to have made

291
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
privacy privacy impact assessments and

292
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
we also need to have processes to remove

293
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,040
ips from this list in case somebody

294
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
somebody who identified himself

295
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
would do so and

296
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,240
so far no criminals have done that so

297
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
that's good

298
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,519
another question

299
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,720
that i am often asked is

300
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
how do we do or how do we deal with

301
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
poisoning and false positives because

302
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
the block list is being distributed

303
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
without questions asked so to speak it's

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,399
being sent to the agent and the agents

305
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,880
just accept it without questioning it

306
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
this means that if we simply can't

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
accept that something is wrong with this

308
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,839
that there are faults in this

309
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,920
and to prevent in order to prevent

310
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,959
poisoning

311
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,160
or

312
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
first let me let me explain a little bit

313
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
about how it works

314
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
when signals are sent to crowdsec it's

315
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,279
it's going into the smoke database

316
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
because you know there's no smoke

317
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,079
without fire

318
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
then the consensus engine as we call it

319
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
is assessing the ips finding out whether

320
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
it's bad or not and if it is bad then it

321
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,640
will end up in the fire database and get

322
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
to get and get distributed back

323
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
but in terms of um

324
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
of poisoning

325
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
we have a mechanism called the trust

326
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
rank basically

327
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,800
um

328
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
whenever and

329
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
all agents submit in signal surprise

330
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,040
they have a trust rank based on how long

331
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,880
time we've known them and have long uh

332
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
and how long time we've known that that

333
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,079
they are reliable

334
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
so a new agent will start with 12th rank

335
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,600
of zero

336
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
and then if they send consistent signals

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
for six months

338
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,079
without any errors then they have

339
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
achieved this trust rank of 99.

340
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,959
the reason for this

341
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,160
is of course

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
to make it

343
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
time-consuming

344
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
to to if you want to poison us so if so

345
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
if you're a bad guy and you want to

346
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,320
poison the crosstalk database first of

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
all it takes time

348
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
the other it also takes uh takes takes a

349
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
lot of asms because one

350
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,600
in this voting process basically

351
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
i'm a level that ip needs a certain a

352
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
number of votes or two in order to be

353
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
malevolent and

354
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
those um votes are given based upon the

355
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
thrust rank meaning that

356
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
that that simply

357
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
an agent needs to have a certain trust

358
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,279
ring in order to

359
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,519
to be able to affect this process

360
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
and on top of that

361
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
um

362
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
and they're saying only has one vote

363
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
and this means that if you are a bad guy

364
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,839
and want to poison the the crowds like

365
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,480
database you do you can spin up like a

366
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
thousand bps's on

367
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
gtp or somewhere else because there

368
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
simply won't be enough asn to make any

369
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
difference

370
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
instead you as as a criminal would have

371
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
to

372
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,760
you know have a fleet of bad

373
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
uh agents but spread across asn essence

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
all around the world in order to

375
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
you know ever have the chance of

376
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
affecting the the consensus process

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
but

378
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,600
obviously that's not all

379
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
all that we do because we also don't

380
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
want false positives

381
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
and the one way to do that is that we

382
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
have our own uh fleet of honey pots

383
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
that

384
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
that we use to compare signals from the

385
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
from the crowd or

386
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
test

387
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
compare

388
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,959
with the signals we get from the crowd

389
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,920
and then i need some water

390
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
that was nice

391
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,959
the second thing

392
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
or the second mechanism of this is

393
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,839
it's basically a white list

394
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
so all google dns is all google xeo bots

395
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,920
all cloudflare cdns

396
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
whatever the thing services that you

397
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
that that you simply don't want to block

398
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,839
they cannot be bought

399
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
and thirdly

400
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:32,959
in the

401
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,959
it sounds a little bit like a pre-crime

402
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
maybe this but

403
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
the way um the way crosstalk also works

404
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
is that it it it looks at eyepiece from

405
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,839
the same knob net block and at some

406
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,720
point if carsick has seen and deemed

407
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
enough ips from the same the net block

408
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
malevolent then it will just you know

409
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
block the rest

410
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,320
of the um

411
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
of the net block regardless of them

412
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
having done anything wrong or not we

413
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
just assumed that yeah you will also do

414
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,680
something wrong so we'll just block your

415
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
head

416
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
and then

417
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
if it ends up in the fire database then

418
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,519
things are distributed back to

419
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,560
to crowdstick agents

420
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
and if you want to know more about

421
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
crosstak then

422
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
this is not the talk for it i won't be

423
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
talking about with os crowd stick

424
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
supports or anything more fainter

425
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,240
technical about that but if you want to

426
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,519
know more then i'll be around at the

427
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,959
pool party and i'll also be around the

428
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,040
def con just follow the trail of the

429
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
crowdstick crowdtake stickers like but

430
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,959
like breadcrumbs

431
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,599
i'll be around

432
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,600
[Music]

433
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
before we move on to the log for day

434
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,199
part

435
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
it's important to understand that

436
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
crowdstick is not a buff and this means

437
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
that the way crowdstrike works as i

438
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
explained before crowdseg needs a lock

439
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
entry in order to block something

440
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,440
right and that is that caused an

441
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
inherent problem if you know a little

442
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
bit about log4j because you know that if

443
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,399
you're vulnerable it only takes one

444
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,160
connection with just one log entry and

445
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,360
then you're screwed

446
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,399
so

447
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
we very much want to

448
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
first of all

449
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
as a security professional i cannot

450
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
recommend only depending on one control

451
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
but if you use crowdtake as one of your

452
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
controls then there is a risk that

453
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
krausseg may not detect it and block it

454
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,079
if if if if it if it's an if it's if

455
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,680
it's an ip that the crowd doesn't know

456
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,199
already

457
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
but luckily

458
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,079
um

459
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,320
we we did a little experian experiment

460
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,880
with two identical servers just to try

461
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
and try and explore

462
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,519
how much of um

463
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,519
how much of what crowdstick is blocked

464
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,279
is being blocked by a community by

465
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
reputation by the block list or or by

466
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,880
local local signals and local processing

467
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
so in order for that we set up a

468
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,360
two servers on ovh

469
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,519
cloud provider in europe

470
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,279
they were completely identical both had

471
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
the agent installed and

472
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,279
another one had what we call the bouncer

473
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,240
which is the ips part installed as well

474
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
on the basically the the bouncer plug

475
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,519
hole plugs into the to the host firewall

476
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,560
so it blocks the connection

477
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,190
and it turned out that um

478
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,600
[Music]

479
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
after three months we compared the

480
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,519
the signals or compared all the attacks

481
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
that had seen and it turned out that 92

482
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
percent of the bad traffic was aimed

483
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,440
aimed at the server is blocked just

484
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,639
based on ib reputation so basically the

485
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
the um

486
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
the the server that that was protected

487
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,160
only saw like the orange

488
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
joins part and that is good that is good

489
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,759
news for if you're vulnerable follow for

490
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
gay and and plan to use card for the

491
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,920
crowd car's sake or for that or of

492
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,120
course similar vulnerabilities

493
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,160
yeah

494
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
and conclusion of course community

495
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
matters as we all know

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
then let's move on

497
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
to the part you came for i hope

498
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
look for jay

499
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
if there should be

500
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
a symbol or a few person in the room not

501
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,319
knowing what look for days i'll give a

502
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,119
super short or super short resume of it

503
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
on december 9 2021 the pasture

504
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,799
foundation released information on the

505
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,520
critical bug in the log4j library

506
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,919
which was exploitable via remote remote

507
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
code execution

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
um

509
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,000
and

510
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,599
i didn't know that before that before

511
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,039
then that but as it turns out love4js

512
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,520
views everywhere and by everywhere i

513
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,760
mean exactly that and

514
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,480
this

515
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
screenshot is from it from a tweet from

516
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
a guy called the guest from coden cast

517
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
van gooden and that's where it dawned on

518
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
me how bad this is because basically he

519
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
said his name into this dndi string

520
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
which complains the contains the exploit

521
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
and the payload

522
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
and he got back

523
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
uh connections from apple servers

524
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
meaning apple servers were also

525
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
vulnerable and i was like

526
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
this is going to be a show

527
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,360
right so um yeah that quickly escalated

528
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
into a worldwide panic and everybody was

529
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
either patching or releasing free tools

530
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,360
and resources held out and

531
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,840
so did we

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,480
as i said before on december 9th

533
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,200
airpatch released information about the

534
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,480
vulnerability

535
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
on december 10th uh kraftwerk released

536
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
our first scenario uh detecting this

537
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
love for day thing

538
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
and then on december 12 on december 13th

539
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,400
and 16th uh

540
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
the scenario was updated because as it's

541
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,360
it's a quite natural um

542
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
development because in the in the

543
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
beginning it was just like a solar

544
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,280
obfuscated jdi string contained the

545
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,919
payload then then over time it would be

546
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
obfuscated in more and more in more and

547
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,640
more obscene ways

548
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
uh and of course the sarah needs to be

549
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
able to take care of that and since um

550
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
it's grog it's very static so in the end

551
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
it ended up

552
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
containing 34 clock patterns for for

553
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,360
matching

554
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
and the last update was in the swimmer

555
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
on december 20th where somebody from the

556
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
community

557
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
added

558
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
support for unicode

559
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,760
unicode encoding

560
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,280
so

561
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
to me this is a really good example of

562
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
why why this cloud-based approach works

563
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
because basically

564
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,039
we we create a signals signal and then

565
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,320
it takes

566
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
i should show a little bit a little bit

567
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
later how long time it takes and then we

568
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
start getting data back

569
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
and signals back of active

570
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
active malevolent actors

571
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,919
in this and that is uh to me i find that

572
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,080
pretty amazing because that is that is

573
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
really what the communities can do when

574
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
you work together

575
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
so

576
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
as you can see

577
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,640
or brought up this is a timeline of from

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,559
starting from december 9th

579
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,280
and ending on december i don't know 16

580
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
17 something like that

581
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,880
no sorry anyway the big spike is when um

582
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,080
is is on a december 12th

583
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,159
where we start getting signals

584
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,120
uh we end up we end up at that point

585
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
with around a thousand ips that we knew

586
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
were actively exploiting this

587
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,960
but as we looked at the data we saw

588
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
something strange in the sense that

589
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
that one

590
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
one ip was um had a different scanning

591
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,799
pattern and and we looked them up and it

592
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,159
turned out to be

593
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,520
a german

594
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
security resource institute they were

595
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
they were basically trying to find out

596
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,039
how big how big is this problem by by

597
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
scanning and we decided not to block

598
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
them because we would then mess with

599
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
their research and also

600
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,640
given that it's not it's not it's not a

601
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
risk so um

602
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,280
so they were filled out

603
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
this is um

604
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,720
an overview of

605
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
of the signals we have received from

606
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
lov4j until now

607
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
the big dive is

608
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
is on the may 18th

609
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
approximately

610
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,960
uh for three mo three months ago we

611
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559
still get we

612
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
we got around 100 100 signals every day

613
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
but today we get around 40 to 50. so

614
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,480
the love for day is not dead

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
rumors are gravely exaggerated

616
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
um

617
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
if you look careful there are a little

618
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
bit of spikes after

619
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,120
may 18th but two biggest one they are

620
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
quite interesting so i'll talk a little

621
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,679
bit about them

622
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,200
we're not really sure what happened

623
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
because as you may know we don't really

624
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
collect much about what's going on we

625
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,000
just know that we don't know exactly

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,320
what which payload or whatever bad

627
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
actors are doing we just know that the

628
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,159
scenario was triggered so based on that

629
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
is relatively impossible

630
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
to find out or try and find out

631
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,039
what they were doing

632
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,080
but

633
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,840
we know who did it

634
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,480
on june 21st our data scientist tweeted

635
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,360
this

636
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
and

637
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,640
that that we saw a big spike and that

638
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,559
was actually the small spike of the big

639
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,760
ones

640
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,480
and the ips 13.89.48.118

641
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,799
they're still they're still around

642
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,280
doing their business with log4j

643
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
um

644
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,840
so

645
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
you can see the graph the two the two

646
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,120
spikes there the first bike is on um

647
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,360
it was under through uh

648
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,039
well or what was on the june 21st

649
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,640
and the second wasn't was a on july 7th

650
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,080
and that was

651
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,880
double as much

652
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
and now i need some more water

653
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,200
we don't know why as i said but

654
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
we do have a theory at least for june

655
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,000
for june 21st because as it turned out

656
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
on june 20th on june 23rd

657
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
two days after the first spike

658
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
cesar the cyber security infrastructure

659
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
security agency in the us

660
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,640
released a bulletin

661
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,320
saying that uh vmware horizon

662
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
a lot for gay related um vulnerability

663
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
in vmware horizon was actively being

664
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,400
being exploited so it is at least to us

665
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,919
it makes sense that

666
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,760
this may this this may have been what

667
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,039
they were scanning for they just knew it

668
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,000
a little bit in advance

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,799
um

670
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
and

671
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
as as i said before in terms of

672
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
a love for gay being everywhere it's

673
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,200
also highly unlikely that that we've

674
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
seen the rest of this

675
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
i'm pretty sure that there are still our

676
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
love for gay things out there so

677
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
love for days definitely not dead

678
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,279
and

679
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
i guess when you think about it it makes

680
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,279
sense that we can also see

681
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,440
other interesting things in the data

682
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,279
that we see that that we receive

683
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,840
but to but to put things a little bit

684
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,520
into perspective

685
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
um this is

686
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
a number it is an overview of the

687
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
signals that that that we that we are

688
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
that we're receiving for the last three

689
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,440
months in average we have we've had 29

690
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,400
millions

691
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,679
a month

692
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,720
um

693
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,520
broken down into weeks and hours

694
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
um

695
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,880
we have around 57 000 agents in 168

696
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
countries right now

697
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,360
and it's it's crazy to to think that

698
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
that the number of number of countries

699
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
just keep rising

700
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,679
i mean

701
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,600
a month ago two months ago it was 150

702
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
and i was thinking well

703
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,000
now that's it but it's not

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
um

705
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
we get around twenty thousand ip

706
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
addresses shared every two hours

707
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,279
there's a two percent renewal rate every

708
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
12 hours which

709
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,360
brings about 400 new ips

710
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,520
every 12 hours and 12 of these ips are

711
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
are then seen for the first time

712
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,720
so

713
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,960
there is a large

714
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
number of ips or

715
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,640
there's a big change

716
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
they're being changed shifted

717
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,400
there's a big shift presented of the

718
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
there's a there's a big percentage of

719
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,600
the ips that are being shifted in the

720
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,840
beginning whereas over time

721
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
uh it's it's a it's a bit more static

722
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,640
um

723
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,440
there's an overview of that here

724
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,200
that's less than one week

725
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,679
12.63 percent but

726
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,120
over time

727
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,039
uh two percent of

728
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,159
two percent uh 2.79

729
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,039
of those ip over time are new so

730
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,279
the the the part of of

731
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,520
of ips that i knew will are decreasing

732
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,480
over time and

733
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,279
one thing that that that we realized in

734
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,880
the beginning of the crosstalk project

735
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,279
project is that the sparse resource on

736
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
uh on the internet or the scarce

737
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
resource on the internet that's ip

738
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,360
numbers so basically the more

739
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,720
difficult

740
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
we can make it for the bad guys to have

741
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,400
new ips because then you they need vips

742
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
for anonymity so basically they just

743
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,440
hang around

744
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
and try to find ips that they can use

745
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,679
for the for whatever they're doing

746
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
the more difficult

747
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,960
we can make it for them the faster we

748
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
can burn their ips the better and that

749
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,760
is basically i would say core vision of

750
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,320
crosstalk really being so many in

751
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
numbers so many agents in the world

752
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,760
and

753
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
and then the top of that being able to

754
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
block it to block them right away we are

755
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
working with um

756
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,279
with an organization that

757
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,080
we who has a pdp block list that we want

758
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,640
to work with we want to push our feed

759
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,799
into into theirs so that so that would

760
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,720
be so that

761
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
whatever cloud succeeds can be blocked

762
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,640
on bdp broader level which is like the

763
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,720
core the foundation

764
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
of the internet so that

765
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,840
there will be no router they won't be

766
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
able to do anything as soon as as

767
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,600
they're detected that that is really the

768
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
vision of crosstalk

769
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,919
um and

770
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,440
yeah

771
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
and basically as

772
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
as this says

773
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
that that they are really always looking

774
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,520
for new ips if we can disrupt this

775
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
process then things are better for

776
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
anyone or everyone except that except

777
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,559
them of course

778
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,440
this is an overview of of the block

779
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,919
lists in in total on the left side you

780
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
can see how many times this ip has ended

781
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
i set it up on a blog list

782
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,399
um

783
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
and then there are like 50 times 25

784
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,720
times 10 and five

785
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
as far as i think yeah

786
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,600
um and it turns out that 79.5

787
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
of the ips in the community blog list

788
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,799
they are there more or less permanently

789
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
for some reason

790
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
um

791
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,080
i want to talk a little bit about a

792
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
layer 7d dos attack that we saw on a

793
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,919
random use of yeah they they're big but

794
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,760
but they're still random

795
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,799
um

796
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,559
i'll show you the graph of of the

797
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,640
signals that we're receiving versus the

798
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
ips that were blocked

799
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
this is a two in one graph so it's a

800
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
little bit confusing

801
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000
but the purple line is the signals that

802
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
this agent sent

803
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
and the yellow was the unique rps that

804
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,960
were blocked

805
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,799
so on july 27th that is the big

806
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,039
blue spike to the left oh sorry to the

807
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,799
right

808
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
more than 4 000 frets was reported on

809
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
1.7 1.8 000 ips whereas on on august 1st

810
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
where the the big spike is a yellow one

811
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,240
um more than eight thousand eight point

812
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
eight thousand ips were blocked unique

813
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,440
ips so this was really adidas attack

814
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,080
but the the good good thing for luckily

815
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,240
for the for the user they had crowd 6 so

816
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,799
nothing happened

817
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
in terms of spring for shell

818
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,720
we had a

819
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,200
big spike on july 16th kind of like the

820
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,679
log for gay spike

821
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,080
only that this time around we

822
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,159
have no idea what's going on

823
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,559
basically so um

824
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,279
we

825
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
we saw that 178 agents

826
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,760
were reporting

827
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,960
signals on on this scenario but

828
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,480
we haven't really find out been able to

829
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
find out so if you know anything

830
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,320
about springfield shell

831
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,039
please let me know

832
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
another thing

833
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
that we found out is that zip is being

834
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,320
constantly hammered

835
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,039
and by hammered i'm in brute force

836
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,120
back in november we were approached

837
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,840
approached by a user a friend a friend's

838
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,480
voice over ip provider

839
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,559
who wanted us to create a scenario to

840
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,159
take stuff like this

841
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,840
um

842
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,600
and

843
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
this sip scenario was installed on our

844
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,360
honeypots it's a relatively

845
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,960
dumb scenario in the sense that it

846
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
doesn't really

847
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,559
look into what you do when you connect

848
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,399
to it you just count the connections to

849
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
it but given that it's a honeypot there

850
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,440
is no

851
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,279
reason why anybody would want to connect

852
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,760
to it next to it connect with it with

853
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,080
something with a legitimate purpose

854
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
another thing with the honeypot is that

855
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,799
it doesn't have a

856
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,080
it doesn't have a bouncer it doesn't

857
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,679
block anything but that being said

858
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,559
um

859
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,200
on one day june 23rd we go we got around

860
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,799
83 000 signals just on that just on on

861
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,320
that specific scenario just from our

862
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
fleet of honeypot which isn't that big

863
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,600
so

864
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,880
if you look at it if you look at the

865
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,480
number of agents

866
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
compared to the amount of signals we get

867
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,520
out of it then

868
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,039
crowd say oh then the sip is definitely

869
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,480
the the most

870
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,720
hammered scenario but it's not the only

871
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
one all ssh is also

872
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
um

873
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
our data is a little bit biased in that

874
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,799
crowd crowdsack is mostly

875
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,960
mostly for linux and when you install

876
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,919
crowslike

877
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,080
it automatically detects if the ssh is

878
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,159
installed and this is installed on linux

879
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,519
so

880
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,279
that's not that big a surprise that this

881
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,240
is the most common signal

882
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
daily we get around one one million

883
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,519
signals

884
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,480
from more than five thousand agents

885
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,840
and

886
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,480
around also around sixty thousand uh bad

887
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,799
actors reported

888
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
sub frets you'll recognize the the

889
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,159
orange and the um

890
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
and the cyan one because those are ssh

891
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,080
brute force and this is a slow brute

892
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,960
force and together they're more than 60

893
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
uh whereas something like windows brute

894
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,159
forcing

895
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,159
is around two percent

896
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
but again our data is biased uh windows

897
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
is not supported until

898
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,120
like so officially until a couple of

899
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,480
weeks ago so obviously

900
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
there aren't that many of those around

901
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
and honestly who would who in the right

902
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,679
mind would put a put a window server on

903
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,880
particular internet right

904
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,240
yep

905
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
another into quite interesting thing

906
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,399
that that we can see in in our data is

907
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
how how good are the different cloud

908
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,960
actors in cleaning up after these

909
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,840
attacks

910
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,960
and we

911
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,640
have looked at the data and

912
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,120
and did a um

913
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,720
the way it works

914
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,919
when when an ip is a is being hacked or

915
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,200
being taken over

916
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,279
uh by a bad actor it will start

917
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,480
appearing up in in our smoke database

918
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,600
purposely

919
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
and then when it doesn't anymore

920
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,279
we assume

921
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,279
that that is being cleaned so in that

922
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,240
period

923
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,120
of time from from once it was seen the

924
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,720
first time i was seen to win is not no

925
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,080
longer seen

926
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,640
an average of that based on all the ips

927
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,559
shows that aws

928
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,039
in average takes three days to clean up

929
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,120
whereas ovh

930
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,559
they take a little bit longer 17 days

931
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
we haven't done it for all child

932
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,399
providers yet but but we will be we will

933
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,399
doing we will be doing a

934
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,039
dedicated reporting on on asms

935
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,480
based on asn in q3

936
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,600
um

937
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
it's not completely fair to say that aws

938
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
are bad and

939
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,240
oh job is sorry that aws are good and oh

940
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,919
and obs are bad it's not that simple

941
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,279
obviously because there is a huge

942
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,320
difference

943
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,640
in what you choose to host

944
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,799
under on that virtual server that that

945
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,440
they have because if you choose to host

946
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
like a php cms that you maybe not be so

947
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,120
good at um at updating then you're

948
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,159
definitely

949
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,720
a way more vulnerable than if you just

950
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,080
have you know linux uh linux with his h

951
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,559
for instance

952
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,000
so yeah and also this is

953
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,640
a little bit more based on

954
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
this is also asn reputation but more

955
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,039
broadly um

956
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
it's a little bit small so i don't know

957
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,159
how much you can see

958
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,720
but um on the y-axis

959
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
there is a number of ips assigned to

960
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,399
this asn and the size of the bubble

961
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,119
is the number of um ips

962
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,800
that are being reported

963
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
because that is not necessarily the same

964
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,079
showing how widespread is

965
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,119
is whatever compromise is going on

966
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,800
um and interestingly enough in top four

967
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,679
um that is chinanet

968
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,719
um

969
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,839
with uh with the 50 000 reported ips

970
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,199
diesel ocean

971
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,639
24 000

972
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,079
that's half

973
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,199
number three is china unicom china 169

974
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,239
backbone

975
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,679
9000

976
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,040
and amazon 7000. so so just to say that

977
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,800
of course there's a difference between

978
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,399
the various asn and the various

979
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,159
providers in how

980
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,199
good

981
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,839
they are and how good they want to be

982
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,920
at cleaning up after the bad guys

983
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,720
yeah and if you look at the legend

984
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,599
which i know is totally impossible then

985
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,599
then you can see which kind of attacks

986
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,920
are primarily being being detected and

987
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
orange is brute force it's our friend

988
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,400
bru force attacks

989
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,520
and uh yeah was the recording what can i

990
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
say

991
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,560
uh for details of course

992
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,119
uh malicious ip origin distributed

993
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,960
between cloud actors

994
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
interestingly enough aws are are still

995
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
are number two here they are real they

996
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,680
have a lot of stuff

997
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,359
that apparently even though that they do

998
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,320
a lot of uh a lot to um

999
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,400
to clean them out

1000
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,640
basically it's not enough

1001
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,880
digital ocean

1002
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,320
yeah

1003
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
the they they are they are they are

1004
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,560
winning this one

1005
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
in terms of uh

1006
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
network strength

1007
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
these these are the the the

1008
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
countries that has the most number of

1009
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
agents but

1010
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,880
france us germany netherlands united

1011
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,040
kingdom which includes dublin and dublin

1012
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,040
is a huge aws hosting site

1013
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
cloud

1014
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,119
cloud computing kind of kind of muddles

1015
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,000
the borders a little bit here because

1016
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,960
a couple of months ago i was speaking in

1017
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,359
in besides co in the besides prisoner in

1018
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,400
kosovo

1019
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
in albania and in countries like that

1020
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
hosting a server is

1021
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
way too expensive so they use cloud

1022
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
computing all the time so

1023
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
whoever is using an ip and only using

1024
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,680
cloud we don't know where they're from

1025
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,960
um but as i said before there's around 6

1026
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,040
56 000 installs in total

1027
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
and um

1028
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
that was it for my talk

1029
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,599

1050
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,359
all right

1051
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
all right so we're gonna have time for

1052
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,520
questions but unfortunately uh we got

1053
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,119
word that there's some issues with the

1054
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,240
wireless mic so we're gonna have to

1055
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,760
stick with the wired mics if any of you

1056
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
have questions even more reason you

1057
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,119
might have to come forward and ask and

1058
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,400
just shout it out

1059
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,079
um but it costs if you could just repeat

1060
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,760
the question and then for everyone oh

1061
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,359
yeah that would probably work okay

1062
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,160
thanks any questions

1063
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,520
oh sorry and the question was um

1064
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,440
why is it so low in topping that list

1065
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,920
and uh and in terms of rotating ips i'm

1066
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,720
not sure i completely understand

1067
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,440
uh

1068
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,640
yeah um

1069
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,160
well i don't i don't really know why

1070
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,000
dear solution is topping the list as i

1071
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
said before it it it has a lot to do

1072
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
with what

1073
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,839
what people are using their their

1074
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,520
their vps is for

1075
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,680
and of course there is also

1076
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,400
like how good how good are

1077
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,680
um

1078
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,160
how good is is the company themselves at

1079
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,119
following up on the on on whoever a

1080
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,000
customer has their bps compromise

1081
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,119
um

1082
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,040
there may be some procedural there i i

1083
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
don't know

1084
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
um

1085
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
yeah i don't know really my i don't know

1086
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,839
what's more what more can say about the

1087
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,839
rotation of ips other than

1088
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,160
then it's that given that that the bad

1089
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
guys want to want to be anonymous they

1090
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,520
um

1091
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
they they change high piece a lot so so

1092
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,839
the faster the providers are cleaning up

1093
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,480
they need to find new new pools of of

1094
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,680
ips

1095
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
and um

1096
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,200
also stay anonymous

1097
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,760
so yeah that's basically as i said i

1098
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,520
don't really know what what what else to

1099
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
say about it that's uh that's that i

1100
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
guess that's that's just how it works

1101
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,880
but uh if there's no more questions um

1102
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,800
follow me find me i

1103
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,040

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,359
