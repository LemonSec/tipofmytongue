00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
technological you know especially people

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
uh i don't know how to say exactly this

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,080
in english but

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
it's not poor people how do i say like

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
they don't have the opportunity to learn

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
about technology how what they can do

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,519
with this

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
so basically it's me there's much more

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,879
than this of course i have a lot of

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,440
tattoos so lots of stories

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,159
and so what we're to talk today about

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,280
our social landscape so why this happens

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,000
and or a brazilian underground

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
like uh fro how crowds banks money mo

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
mules

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,319
scams tools i hope to get more worse

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,440
you know is the last part but i hope so

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
and why does it happens

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
okay

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
so

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
when you what comes your mind when you

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
think about brazil definitely it's not

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
about scams probably it's about caraval

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
caipirinha summer

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,799
this

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,599
so

91
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,920
but probably never crossed her mind that

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,239
one of uh brazil is one of the leaders

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,920
leading countries in uh global uh and

94
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,599
grow up sorry and on online fraud see i

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
i took this map from 2020 but

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
it's pretty much the same you know

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
brazil's

98
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,239
highest frauds and bank frauds in

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
brazil's a lot you know

100
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
according to this research is holland

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
berger we are in the fifth country

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
suffered most cyber crimes in brazil in

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
last year and january last year for

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
example we have a mega league exposing

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
data from

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,798
more than population in brazil because

107
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,440
included that the c deceased ones too i

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
mean

109
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,080
two

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
million

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
two hundred million and something i mean

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,759
a lot of data leak you know you know

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,000
what we can do with data leaks a lot

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,479
everything we can use for

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,919
any purpose you know to hack or even

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,000
just because for fun you know to do all

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
scenes in someone

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,479
so

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,600
we have

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
and in brazil beside the cyber crimes

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
they have had many many data breaches

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
all the time this sucks but happens a

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,960
lot

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
um

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
wow among this information this data

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
that was leaked there was

127
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,360
okay a social security number that is is

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
another name in portuguese but id name

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,320
birthday vinco the employer

130
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,400
identification number credit card scores

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
addresses photos education i mean

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,039
everything it was online

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,000
so was leaked and wow it's a lot of

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
information and this data as i said

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
before is extremely crucial for

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,000
criminals or not criminals i can just do

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
for

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
because just because they can use this

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,960
data for fraud for example for fishing

140
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
or smashing or whatever

141
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
so

142
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,000
this sucks you know there's a lot of

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
data

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,840
so our landscape why

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,479
why where it's begun you know brazil has

146
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,600
a massive social inequality

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,560
so

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
many many many people there

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
adopted this

150
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,600
so-called gambiah you know as a way of

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
life what is gambia

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
macgyverism

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
you know it's something like this in

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,440
brazil jerry i i don't know what's the

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
best word for this macgyver is with

156
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
jerry

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
but which one is better in english

158
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
macgyver

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,759
now i know

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,880
so the definition of gambia is this that

161
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
how you pronounce gambiah this is very

162
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
important it's completely different here

163
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
is a brazilian way of fixing things as

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,319
expression we can do our work around or

165
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
everything just to i don't know

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,160
sue a button or

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
leave just for leave you know from

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,520
battle situations for to work

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
for hacking for everything and

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
inexpensive of others this is not cool

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
of course you know

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
this is bad but people do this

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
so

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
what happens in our underground

175
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,560
underground

176
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,599
uh let's

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,280
give a quick uh overview no so back in

178
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,840
the mid of 90s early 2000s you know

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,720

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
how i do this how i can

182
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,400
check if vulnerabilities on com on that

183
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
website that's very weird at websites do

184
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
you remember that blog from 90s is kind

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,960
of

186
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,319
yeah weird so they used to deface that

187
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,120
to explore what's going on so and there

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
was a many many

189
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
uh photos to discuss this from people

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,759
from around the world but as you know

191
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,319
brazil is not a super rich country so

192
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
who have a computer was kind not rich

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,199
but

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,520

so they have this discussion oh wow how

205
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
we can exploit some vulnerabilities how

206
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
we can learn remember that time we

207
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
didn't have framework so many books that

208

didn't have like internet as we know

209
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
today you know to check information you

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
know what's hard you have to talk with

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,639
someone in almost in real life to know

212
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,000
information

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
so people talk about this and that so

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
defacement was the rule in everywhere um

215

248
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
people who know about how to

249
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
exploit vulnerabilities on the website

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,959
say okay let's do this and start to you

251
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
know break the banks and get money

252
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
and then

253
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,120
okay so with the time these guys uh

254
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
i don't know i don't want to learn more

255
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,680
about vuenerability you know to learn

256
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
how to hack things because this is easy

257
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,160
money for me

258
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
so they stopped just stopped to learn

259
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,200
and they bought this like a kit with

260
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
everything

261
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
you know someone developed and they use

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
this to exploit and that's it and they

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
then start the cyber criminal in brazil

264
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
but this is very important they don't

265
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,320
use like any tour sites or tor

266
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,279
uh on in underground farms was just

267
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,079
you know open now in the beginning was

268
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,279
irc

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,320
forums

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
and then they moved to facebook whatsapp

271
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
tick tock and now instagram so it's

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,360
super easy to find these things online

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
um

274
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
but before we go on something very very

275
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
important about you know the brazilian

276
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
things maybe you don't know about this

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
so social engineer of course is the

278
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,640
backbone of best

279
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,519
of

280
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,560
most of our scans this is very important

281
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
we have this very popular bank

282
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,680
transaction it speaks uh that is instant

283
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,279
stand payment

284
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,279
i i think there is

285
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
something

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
kind of this here but not like in brazil

287
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
because in brazil there is a central

288
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
bank it's straight with central bank and

289
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
here there's uh

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,279
someone in the middle uh zeal zell

291
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,680
something like this right so in brazil

292
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,920
this is very popular we do this every

293
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
time everything oh give me one hell okay

294
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,160
i i sent you so in order to do this you

295
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,399
need uh and then an uh kind of

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
identification maybe is my id

297
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,279
or

298
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,920
my phone number or

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,880
my email so with this information we can

300
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,720
send

301
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
for someone else but when you send this

302
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
for other person you can see in the in

303
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,079
the bank or you send for

304
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
someone

305
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,800
joe da silva for example and that is his

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,959
id number you shouldn't give for

307
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,519
everybody like social number you

308
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,680

309
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
your social number so that's this number

310
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,600

so a lot of information as you know we

313
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
can do a lot with this information if a

314
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
little piece of information

315
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
uh what else in brazil we love make

316
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
payments using volatiles uh like bank

317
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
sleep it's a kind of bank sleep is not

318
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,959
the same but

319
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,639
something like this we pay everything

320
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
with boleto especially

321
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,279
like cars we have like a thousand of

322
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
bullets we pay every single amount or to

323
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
buy appliances like a fridge or

324
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
whatever we can do this for everything

325
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
to buy a phone to buy a shoe yes this is

326
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
weird but we use this a lot

327
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
uh we use a lot of uh what's up

328
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
top counters to use what's up and of

329
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
course we have many many many scans

330
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,040
using whatsapp many

331
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
uh and

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
brazilian bank system is pretty much

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,600
digital so we it's easy to open an

334
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
account to get personal loan not big

335
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,079
banks because they have many protections

336
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360
but small banks because opens a new

337
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
digital bank every

338
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
every single day and

339
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
some of the case i present here is in my

340
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,000

makes some packages you know with

527
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720

you open a bank account you need like uh

529
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480

but some banks uh they put oh

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
sometimes too close too far it's good my

534
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
advice okay cool

535
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
so but this new bank they don't have so

536
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
much protections you know online bank so

537
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,400

but

545
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
she don't guarantee cred scarf because

546

you know but this is very cool right

581
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,480
i can't remember what github is this

582
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,799
algorithm is but i can looking for if

583
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,080

972
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,160

976
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,000
eye for this and know what you're

977

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,760
this okay

979
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,440
it's okay

980
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,079
and remember we use this for everything

981
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,599
in your life we can use this for about

982
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,880
to buy a car

983
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
can you picture like

984
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,599
24 bank sleeps you pay every single

985
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
amount if you don't pay okay you can

986
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,839
have to pay a extra fee because you

987
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,040
don't didn't pay in the same day but

988
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680

989
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,119
instant payment

990
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,800

it's super easy you know to cheat people

1035
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
because people believe they can have

1036
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
free money not work because work is for

1037

stupid people of course yeah

1038
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,800

1044
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,599
to use hotmail but there is other you

1045
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,839
know uh

1046
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,160
domain like simple domains that's not

1047
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,839
big like google

1048
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,200
but so really really simple what these

1049
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
guys do

1050
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,200
they

1051
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,440
hijack the emails you know

1052
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,720
and let me show actually the dashboard

1053
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,280
the two tests these two you test the

1054
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,480
these domains you know and searching for

1055
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,200
keywords for example boletto

1056
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,599
but only works in these small domains

1057
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,520
now different domains not google not the

1058
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,160
big ones the smaller ones so it would

1059
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,280
check for this and then oh he spotted uh

1060
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,720
oh a payment sleep okay good perfect

1061
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,319
what he does he download this

1062
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,079
and then he changed the numbers the

1063
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,119
barcode changed for the for his account

1064
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,359
and put again how he does this using

1065
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,359
imap protocol because you can change

1066
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,240
using imap you know this

1067
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
uh see oh the guy found this the star

1068
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,359
this two so is that two with many

1069
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,400
first he found the keywords the emails

1070
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,760
you know that's our round found changes

1071
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,400
uh this attach it um

1072
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,040
payment sleep so the guy you get money

1073
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,640
it's it's a

1074
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,400
a little work you know to do this

1075
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,079
because you have to looking forward and

1076
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,240
then download and then you can move like

1077
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,119
in paint brush for example really so

1078
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,720
just this and then back to the um the

1079
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,839
mail

1080
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,720
box and the person you never see this

1081
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,599
because

1082
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,560
when

1083
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,319
this um these domains use imap and you

1084
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,400
can change things you know using imap

1085
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,680
and the people

1086
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,640
don't

1087
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,160

they do this it's

1093
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,200

that's things that you're doing the app

1161
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,680
and but this too

1162
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,280
this uh

1163
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,319
they check if it is working usually it's

1164
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,640
up for

1165
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,040
check if uh the person have this

1166
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,000
severance pay in the account is working

1167
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,560
and then they try and withdraw money for

1168
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,480
usually for poor people really poor

1169
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,200
people like have minimum wage

1170
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
that sucks but

1171
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,640
it's easier to get money from poor

1172
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,400
people because

1173
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,160
it's a little money no one cares of

1174
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,920
course we care everybody cares for this

1175
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,040

that's not just for kids but just a

1220
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,880
little smarter person can do this

1221
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,960
because of course you can buy a mower

1222
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,000
you know

1223
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,920
why did you use a mower

1224
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,359
but in brazil

1225
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,000
this is uh most common in brazil guildma

1226
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,240
or astarot casbanero

1227
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
some works here in u.s in europe in

1228
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,040
latin america and in brazil just

1229
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,800
everything i say is not just in brazil

1230
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,200
they are this kind of scans is spreading

1231
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,960
all around the world

1232
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,400
but what they have in common uh they are

1233
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,599
like a frankenstein they try they

1234
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,800
uh they just buy this ready to use and

1235
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
change every time police oh you can do

1236
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,839
this i have just five minutes so i

1237
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,800
speak really fast and try to but if you

1238
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,160
have some questions i'm here so

1239
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,559

overlay screen you know they use overlay

1243
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,520
screen why this happen if everybody use

1244
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,480
because this kind of mowers is easy to

1245
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,880
use on desktop right and everybody use

1246
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,599

1248
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,359
central

1249
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,800
transactions

1250
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,680
well in brazil we have to use in desktop

1251
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,640
and they sent spend like gitma or

1252
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,880
astronaut they send like a million

1253
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,480
spends per day is a lot of so someone oh

1254
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,400
okay i can do this and click that and

1255
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,599
get fished

1256
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,319
so and they get money and they only on

1257
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,800
desktop they are super simple they are

1258
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,559
very resilient and do this every time

1259
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,119
this trojan uh don't need knowledge you

1260
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,520
know you don't beca be a super hacker to

1261
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
do this and a lot of gambia

1262
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,880
macgyverism

1263
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,839
and they are right in delphi come on

1264
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,800
it's pretty old versions really

1265
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,680
using

1266
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,559
overlay attack and the

1267
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,559
infinite patience and resilience of

1268
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,960
these guys trying over and over again in
