presentation uh blue will be presenting

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,480
today on tomb raider automating data

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
recovery and digital forensics so i'm

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
the absolute honor in uh going ahead and

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
starting this presentation

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,920
of course what presentation would be

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,439
complete without a few

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,279

uh turned into like a vibrate mode but

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,400
also please try and keep them in your

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
pockets if possible

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
afterwards uh and just a reminder of

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,600

photo of course we are trying to be

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,439
sensitive to those who are

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
in unique situations that prefer not to

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
be photographed so please try not to

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
take photos uh here without explicit

52
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,479
permission of everybody in the

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
photograph so

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,600
uh

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,839

that all right

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
so without further ado i will go ahead

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
and turn it over to blue blue thank you

60
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
so much for being here and uh have a

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,799
nice afternoon

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,119
thank you very much glad to be here man

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,319
what did you do

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
i knew i forgot something

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
okay so um please if you go if you're

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
going to go ahead and ask a question

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
there is a microphone in the middle of

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,720
the room it's not that we can't hear you

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
it's because it's being recorded those

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
who watch the recording afterwards will

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
not be able to hear the question so we

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
do request if you're going to ask a

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
question uh towards the i guess the end

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
of the you know q a session please come

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,840
up and use the microphone in the middle

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
of the room so we can capture that of

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,959
course blue it's always nice if you can

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
repeat the question

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
when they say it just so that we go

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
ahead and capture it as well so thank

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,480
you

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,239
yeah i'll repeat it no problem

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,760
this is still good for mike right you

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
guys can hear me

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,120
back of the room you guys can hear me

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
too

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
okay great

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
uh

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,800
cool

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
without further further ado's

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,200
i'm really glad to be here and uh thank

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,280
you guys all for coming so

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,720
i'm gonna be talking about a tool i made

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
today called tomb raider

95
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
much like the game there will be a few

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
jokes about that but

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
overall uh i hope the naming of it

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,440
becomes obvious soon enough

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,319
uh automating data recovery and a little

100
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,800
bit of digital forensics as well

101
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
so first

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
obligatory introduction my name is blue

103
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
yes i like the color

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
if i were green i would die

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
this guy

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
he gets it

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
his difficult life

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
pronouns are she her whatever but

109
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
uh yeah and that's the problem you get

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
the bad kermit

111
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
we don't want to see that

112
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,879
otherwise we're good to go so thank you

113
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,720
all

114
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
i like hard drives and data recovery

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
that's the topic of today

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,879
i started on my own broken hard drives i

117
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,400
think many of us have

118
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760
these

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
and uh we just had it laying around and

120
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
i figured i'll figure out how to do this

121
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,480
and work from there since then i've

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
started doing all manner of other ones

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,840
the uh ones i could find at local hacker

124
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
spaces in the dump in the trash anything

125
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,519
really

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
and uh

127
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
yeah

128
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,040
let's talk about how you do what i do

129
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
so

130
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,519
first we're going to talk about an

131
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,600
overview of everything that this tool

132
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
does we're going to talk about

133
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
the steps of data recovery

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
and a little bit of the background of

135
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
that

136
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,199
and then walk you through how we're

137
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
going to automate those tools those

138
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,440
steps and improve them with tomb raider

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
so we start with hardware prep you have

140
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,120
a broken hard drive how do you

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
go from that to an interface you can

142
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
work with

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
afterwards how do you image the drive

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
we'll talk about what that means and how

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
to do it

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
then how do you possibly recover a file

147
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
system if you've lost it

148
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
and

149
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
if that doesn't work

150
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
or if it does work how can you also get

151
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
extra

152
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
deleted files determine what

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
a random piece of memory is

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
something known as file carbon which

155
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
i'll go into in a minute

156
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
and then afterwards

157
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
some stuff where to write tomb raider

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,960
really shines is uh post-processing so

159
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,000
handling

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
all of this data that you get from a

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
given hard drive you might have

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
terabytes of data from even a small

163
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,720
like 500 gigabyte hard drive

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,400
how do we deal with that how do we sort

165
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
it out and actually find out what's ours

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
what's not or if you're dealing with a

167
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,080
random dumpster drive hard drive how do

168
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,199
you figure out what's interesting and

169
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,240
what's not

170
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,680
how do you figure out what's actual user

171
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
data and not just microsoft system files

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
additionally if you're looking for it

173
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
you can also crypto salvage and look for

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
if there's any evidence of

175
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
cryptocurrency on that hardware

176
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,039
so

177
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
first again

178
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,639
why would blue do this

179
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
well there's lots and lots of reasons

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
you are already here so i i kind of

181
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,840
succeeded

182
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,919
congratulations you've now

183
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
you're now trapped you can now have to

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,759
learn about data recovery uh just

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
kidding you can leave if you want but

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
whatever point is

187
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,919
i usually don't like asking why because

188
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,120
i mean i mean i'm already here i'm

189
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
already trying to learn it

190
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
i digress

191
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
a lot of us don't want to pay tons of

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
money

193
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
just when we could do it ourselves

194
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
we have a lot of broken hard drives i

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
did

196
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
i didn't want to

197
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
have to shell out 500 bucks for them to

198
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
maybe not even get anything

199
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,639
or

200
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,720
especially if i have my own private data

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
on there i don't want to just give it to

202
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
someone and be like hey try and get this

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,199
the only way to know if you've actually

204
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
gotten it is to get your data so that is

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
a privacy concern there's lots of

206
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
reasons you might also just want to

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
explore like i've done where you find

208
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,720
random hard drives

209
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
that otherwise would have been disposed

210
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,639
entirely and

211
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,280
figure out what was on them what is the

212
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
story there

213
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
additionally if you are interested in

214
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,120
digital forensics

215
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
i am happy to announce that you cannot

216
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,639
do forensics if you don't have a hard

217
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,759
drive with data on it

218
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,680
if you can't get the data off of it how

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
are you going to do forensics on it

220
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,960
you can determine oh this hard drive got

221
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
hit with a sledgehammer and that's about

222
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,080
it

223
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,759
but if you can't recover the actual data

224
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
from it it's a bit of a bummer

225
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,319
so

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,759
i consider this a stepping stone

227
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,479
additionally a better programmer

228
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
and a better hacker

229
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
so

230
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
first what you can do

231
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
here's what you can do with data

232
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
recovery

233
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
more than 90 of the problems with hard

234
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,280
drives with minimal effort

235
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
you can just solve them really easily

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
from my experience with ones that are

237
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,599
literally e-waste

238
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
thrown away and i have no reason to

239
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
believe that most of them were

240
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,599
i have no reason to believe that they

241
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
were

242
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
function

243
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,680
functional or

244
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,919
rather i should say

245
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,639
many of the hard drives i found

246
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
i found little errors on them that were

247
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
really easily fixed

248
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
but i presume people threw them away

249
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
because they didn't know how to fix them

250
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
and now

251
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
with this tool i was just automating it

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,599
and going through it and finding all

253
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,879
this stuff that people didn't realize

254
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
was still there they thought it was just

255
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,279
oh it's not booting this is happening

256
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,360
why is that

257
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
there are of course the other 10 though

258
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
5 which are harder software problems or

259
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,159
hardware itself

260
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
like if you did hit it with a

261
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
sledgehammer you might have this problem

262
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
where you damaged the board on top of it

263
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,839
or

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,399
in case of even worse cases

265
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
you really destroyed it in which case

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
well

267
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
i can't cover that in this talk

268
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
the other five percent as well

269
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
unfortunately i only have so much time

270
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,839
so

271
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,920
ask me about it later or in the q a if

272
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
you like

273
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
that other other five percent the five

274
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
percent that we cannot really recover

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,480
we've actually seen some death gun talks

276
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
about them

277
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
if it's properly encrypted

278
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,320
if it's

279
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,680
completely overridden with zeros

280
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
and

281
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
or random data or just new files

282
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
it's gonna be gone

283
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
if it's blown up and the platters are

284
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
broken if it's melted into slag

285
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
well we don't really yet have the

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
ability to do that unless maybe you have

287
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
a really serious microscope

288
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
like in crazy resources and patients

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
additionally some stuff with solid state

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
drives

291
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
i will cover

292
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,920
that later if you guys want to ask

293
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
questions and talk about it um

294
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,480
anyways intentionally destroyed drives

295
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
this was a hard drive that i found in

296
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,640
the san francisco uh dump

297
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
and um

298
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
you'll notice a lot of things about this

299
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,360
first off all the pins are really

300
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
weirdly bent and the ribbon cables on

301
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
the left are cut the there's cables that

302
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,399
are

303
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
directly cut without much damage to the

304
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
rest of it

305
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
which is a little unusual you would

306
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,600
expect if this just got dropped on the

307
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,120
stairs it wouldn't really look like this

308
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,480
and that's because it i have reason to

309
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,560
believe this was intentionally destroyed

310
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
um and they well they intentionally

311
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
tried to destroy it

312
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,320
because in reality all i had to do was

313
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,839
find another hard drive with the same

314
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
model replace the board

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
and then i could read off of it just

316
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,839
fine because the underlying thing

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,880
the underlying data storage device that

318
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
had all the files was still there

319
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,519
it was a little beaten up

320
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,720
they presumably threw it against the

321
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
wall or something but it was working

322
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
just fine

323
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
and on that

324
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,279
interesting things

325
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,040
this hard drive contained data from the

326
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
san francisco water this guy who's on

327
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,079
the san francisco water transit

328
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,079
authority we had some information on

329
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
boat requirements and specifics for

330
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,600
vessel

331
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
voyages and

332
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
all manner of things that had to be

333
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
ready for

334
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
additionally

335
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,079
random stuff like this presentation

336
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,399
which has wingdings in the title i'm not

337
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
entirely sure and uh

338
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
making fairies a viable transit option

339
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
this guy's article on feet of fairies

340
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
which is a little bit of a weird name

341
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
but i'm not going to judge

342
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,399
so

343
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,920
steve here feels very strongly about

344
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
fairies he would choose berries if one

345
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
day the day came down to it so

346
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,600
good for him um other stuff you might

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
find

348
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
interesting account info

349
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
first name last name

350
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,519
home addresses phone numbers this is a

351
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,839
massive address book

352
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,760
it keeps going

353
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,639
and these are just random names of

354
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,320
somebody who

355
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,839
presumably was an accountant or

356
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,600
secretary or just a home just a normal

357
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
person

358
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,959
and they left this there thinking it

359
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,000
would be gone it was not gone

360
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
there are

361
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
a scary amount of data on these things

362
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
if you're interested in finding stuff

363
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,040
like that i don't encourage using it for

364
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
bad

365
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,440
but

366
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
if you're interested and you just like

367
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,279
finding stuff like this like i do

368
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
give it a shot

369
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
uh oh yeah psychiatric records of this

370
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
guy's medical history

371
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
that was pretty rough that was quite a

372
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,120
story

373
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,279
i blurted out but

374
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,240
yeah

375
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,440
that's a thing

376
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
on a brighter note

377
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,959
i also found copies of the room by tommy

378
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,959
wiseau and other wonderful movies and

379
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,320
films like that where you can just get

380
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
for free because

381
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
why not it's on someone's hard drive if

382
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
you've already got stuff on your hard

383
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
drive and someone else got it

384
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,079
congratulations now they can get it

385
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
using this tool

386
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
you also find glitched images like this

387
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,839
which can be uh which can have little

388
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,279
stories of their own like i like the

389
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
soccer guys who are like really upset

390
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,880
about their image getting glitched out

391
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,040
and they're trying to argue it back i

392
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
have no idea what happened with the aol

393
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,480
image on the left or the ducks or

394
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
whatever that is

395
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
curious things like this interesting and

396
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,120
foreboding ones like this and the

397
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
terrifying monstrosity on the top left

398
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
that looks into your soul uh

399
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
little darla has a treat for you is what

400
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
that one in the middle says which is

401
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
let's continue to something less scary

402
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,839
oh god no anyways this guy

403
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,600
i have no idea where he came from but he

404
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
was also on a hard drive

405
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,440
his name is craig

406
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,120
and at first i was terrified of craig

407
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
because i was like

408
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
i mean no offense craig but look at him

409
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
um

410
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
but he actually just has a little

411
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,079
spatula and a little skillet on the left

412
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,440
there

413
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
and i realized he's just making a little

414
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,519
breaky and he's misunderstood

415
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
and now i love him

416
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
anyways

417
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,399
you can also find dogecoin at bitcoin

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
whatever um

419
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,240
slightly less valuable now sorry guys

420
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
but i have found a few of those and made

421
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
money but i'm not sure if that or craig

422
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,279
made me happier

423
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,480
all this from these intentionally

424
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
destroyed drops

425
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,680
you may have one like this you may have

426
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
one that's less damaged

427
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
so with that said

428
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
let's get back into

429
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
how to do this how tomb raider can

430
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
automate it how

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
you can find your own little treasures

432
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,880
how you can recover your own personal

433
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,639
data stuff that is important to you

434
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
we'll give a brief description of each

435
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,519
bid and how it works because i sure

436
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
didn't know all these steps beforehand

437
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,800
and then we'll cover how tomb raider

438
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
automates it we'll cover how we can make

439
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
that faster optimize things speed things

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
up and uh walk through it

441
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,360
to do that i'm going to employ what i

442
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
call the library analogy

443
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
and to explain that first imagine you

444
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,120
have a big library this library is your

445
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
storage device your hard drive it has

446
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
all of your documents all your downloads

447
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
all your pictures somewhere in it you

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
have it organized in your own specific

449
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,120
way using

450
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,839
a catalog an index

451
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
just like you might go to a library and

452
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,680
look up where is the fiction or

453
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,639
non-fiction where are the uh books by

454
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,000
jules verne or uh edgar allan poes

455
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
poetry

456
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,760
you have documents downloads desktop

457
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
pictures media

458
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
music everything like that somewhere in

459
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
your library of your hard drive

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
this is your file system and without it

461
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
it becomes uh really really hard to find

462
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,519
stuff

463
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
there's a lot of books in there

464
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
so

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,560
this is how we're going to represent it

466
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
and with that said

467
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
talk about deleting files

468
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,720
no data cut recovery talk would be

469
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
complete without deleted files right

470
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
so

471
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,800
library storage device

472
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
books the data

473
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,560
and our catalog is our file system

474
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,279
what happens when you actually delete a

475
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
file in your file system

476
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
the normal way throw in the recycle bin

477
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
empty the recycle bin throw in the trash

478
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
into the crash whatever whatever yada

479
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
yada

480
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,759
well

481
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,720
unfortunately for those who really want

482
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
it gone that is not going to actually

483
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,399
delete anything that is going to remove

484
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
it from the file system

485
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
but not off of the hard drive itself

486
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,759
it's never deleted

487
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
it's only overwritten

488
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,920
this is as if

489
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,360
you remove something from your catalog

490
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
from the system that stores it and lets

491
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
you find it

492
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,079
but

493
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,120
not from the shelf like that

494
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
that never happens unless you really

495
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
really try hard to get it to do that

496
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
sometimes it's easier but

497
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
by default that's not the behavior

498
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,120
and default behavior is uh what most

499
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
people end up using

500
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,320
most people who i've read these drives

501
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,279
from

502
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,320
are using specifically

503
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
and if it's still there

504
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,400
well

505
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
let's just you know take the bookshelf

506
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,280
and handle that later so

507
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
let's get your device ready for tomb

508
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,520
raider to run on

509
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,520
i usually just plug it in to my desktop

510
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
i recommend not plugging in random

511
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,679
drives into your work desktop because

512
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,760
that is basically

513
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,080
just as bad as plugging in random flash

514
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
drives into your desktop and we know

515
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,600
that's a bad let's not do that

516
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
i usually just use a normal

517
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
motherboard connection on my desktop to

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
do this you can use a lot of adapters

519
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,600
however that work just fine on most

520
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
computers

521
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
and you may not be able to recognize it

522
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
in your file system itself

523
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,559
but

524
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,039
once you find the identifier for it

525
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
which i described

526
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
on the github page and at the end of

527
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
this presentation you can see the link

528
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
to that page where you can download the

529
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,679
software and deploy it in everything

530
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
that's all documented along with the

531
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,559
software it's got usage instructions

532
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,559
and

533
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,679
even if your file system doesn't

534
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,360
recognize it

535
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,399
that's how you can find it

536
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,120
it works best on linux i did develop it

537
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
on linux so

538
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,679
yes sorry maybe future development in

539
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
the future

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
it's so much easier in linux i can just

541
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
download all this stuff and there's only

542
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
a handful of commands to set it up

543
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
if i have the time i'd love to deploy it

544
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
for other os's but uh you can also just

545
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,080
help me make code requests on the github

546
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
repository

547
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,039
please

548
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,280
anyways

549
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,720
imaging

550
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
once we've got it plugged in once we've

551
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
got it recognized

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
using tomb raider and instructions on

553
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
the repository

554
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
we want to image the drive

555
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
what is that

556
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
well

557
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,160
basically we take the entire library

558
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,559
why would we do that because it's pretty

559
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,600
big

560
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
and we don't really want to just have a

561
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,480
big

562
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,360
disk

563
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
that we have to plug in all the time

564
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
just to read it

565
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,480
it might get damaged

566
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,039
it might get

567
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
like

568
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,480
it might get damaged it might actually

569
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
get worse over time the more we mess

570
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,280
with it and

571
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,720
that's no good at all we wanted to

572
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
produce the same results every time we

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
want to be able to copy it if we can so

574
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
we don't lose anything else

575
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,120
so

576
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,840
tomb raider uses a tool called safe copy

577
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
to incrementally get as much data as

578
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
possible from the drive

579
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
it uses this incrementally makes a bunch

580
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
of passes through it tries to get as

581
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,280
much as possible even from areas that

582
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
get damaged or corrupted

583
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
safeguard is a wonderful tool so thanks

584
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
to that it's the only part that requires

585
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
the physical drive

586
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,320
after this you can unplug it

587
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,200
throw it in a blender maybe don't

588
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
but

589
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,159
you know you can

590
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,360
anyways

591
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
now that we've got the entire library in

592
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,120
a file on our computer

593
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,640
we want to try and get the catalog for

594
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
it

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
file system recovery

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
we want to find our way to recognize

597
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,600
where

598
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
our documents are to find out if we

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
still have pictures

600
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,080
what are the audio files

601
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
it's pretty helpful to have our catalog

602
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
we've likely spent a lot of time

603
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,720
organizing it

604
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
it's not explicitly necessary because

605
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
the books are all still there we can

606
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
still take the bookshelves but

607
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
it's very very helpful and we want to

608
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,760
find it if we can so we start with that

609
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
it yeah metadata

610
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600
we use testdisk to get a set of these

611
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
files yes this is another lovely tool we

612
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,760
make use of a lot of them

613
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
to get all of the files that it can from

614
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
a variety of supported file systems

615
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
and uh recover those if at all possible

616
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
because that of course if we don't have

617
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
to go through those bookshelves on our

618
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
own

619
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,520
those bookshelves on our own

620
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
let's not

621
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
because we'll see later that we'll see

622
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,080
in just a second

623
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
on that topic

624
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,159
it's not too fun

625
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,960
so

626
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
start with test disk afterwards we do

627
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
file carbon

628
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
this is if we did have to go through it

629
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,360
manually this is if we don't have a file

630
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,720
system

631
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
and we did take the bookshelves

632
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,039
if we do that we want to look through

633
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,559
them for stuff that still looks like

634
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
books we want to

635
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
discard the catalog entirely and say

636
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
screw that i don't trust anything i'm

637
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,640
just going to look through all of my

638
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
bookshelves even if it looks empty and

639
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,640
see what i can find

640
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
and that's what we call file carbon

641
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
you are carving out unallocated space

642
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,080
you're carving out of this

643
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
empty space

644
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,360
this randomized data maybe

645
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,880
actual meaningful data

646
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,440
we use headers footers there's a lot of

647
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
different mechanisms

648
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
to possibly get this data from it

649
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,840
it's super

650
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,919
fun let's go through an example

651
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,480
just to show how fun it is so

652
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
jpeg

653
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
this is uh some of the markers for jpeg

654
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
from wikipedia

655
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
i don't know if you can see this but

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
it's okay if you can't there's just a

657
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
lot of uh different indicators of uh

658
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
hexadecimal encodings whatever stuff

659
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,480
that represents the start of the image

660
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
at the end of the image

661
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,639
and here's an example image

662
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
in this example image you can see all

663
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
sorts of different jumbles of

664
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,600
hexadecimal characters

665
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
and uh if anyone can spot the start of

666
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,360
the image in this

667
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
on the right here let me know and uh

668
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
raise your hand i'd love to

669
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,679
see it as an exercise yo what's up

670
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,559
crap i i can't hear you

671
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,360
okay

672
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,440
wow they found it

673
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
it's in the top left

674
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
good eye

675
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
um

676
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
there's this random

677
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
octet right here this random set

678
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
that is the beginning of it obviously it

679
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
starts with that

680
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
and then there's another code the way

681
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,400
later down in the list that goes right

682
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
next to that

683
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,679
and that's another indicator that this

684
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
is a jpeg

685
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
very helpful

686
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
not very easy to spot we do have to go

687
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
through all this list checking for these

688
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
things

689
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,000
and then at the end of the image

690
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,080
we have to look around for the code that

691
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
indicates it's over because we not only

692
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
have to know if we're carving something

693
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
out where it starts but to know where it

694
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,559
ends

695
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,919
we don't know how big the image is

696
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,919
without this

697
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,720
so you look for a go that indicates that

698
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
and you can find that right there

699
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
now

700
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,919
let's do that for every extension ever

701
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,840
let's find wikipedia pages if they even

702
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,120
exist for stuff like rar files and uh

703
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
dot aaa files and whatever else this is

704
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,279
a list of like just the ones that start

705
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,559
with a

706
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,760
and just the ones that

707
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,440
are the very beginning of this tool

708
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
we'll cover in a minute

709
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
that'd be great

710
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,919
except it wouldn't it would suck so we

711
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,880
instead make use of and

712
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
use our own tools as well

713
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
in combination with this to recover

714
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,520
all extensions that are supported

715
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
from that uncataloged space the space

716
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
without

717
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
an index

718
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,039
this tool is awesome

719
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,600
it covers 480 file extensions and file

720
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
families those are like audio music

721
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
uh videos archives

722
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,320
and

723
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
as you might expect

724
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,279
from something that's just looking

725
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,960
through random data for anything that

726
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,720
looks like important data

727
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
it's going to make

728
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,520
a lot of resulting data

729
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,360
if i gave you a ton of specifications

730
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,200
even if i gave you random noise you are

731
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
going to find

732
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,960
stuff that looks like it

733
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,559
there's likely that we will find

734
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
something that looks like a jpeg even in

735
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,039
random noise eventually

736
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,240
and don't worry about the interface on

737
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,919
the right it's uh

738
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,679
this stuff is very thin

739
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,760
small text let's just emphasize that

740
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,919
there's a lot of extensions here and

741
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,520
that's the interface that photorec

742
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,000
provides

743
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,120
unfortunately a lot of the data that's

744
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,440
produced isn't always meaningful you get

745
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,679
a lot you get false positives you get

746
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
data that is microsoft system files you

747
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,039
get random log files corrupted data

748
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,320
so that's not useful also your

749
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
computer's out of storage space sorry

750
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,600
about that

751
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
it

752
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,159
this is a lot of data that's getting

753
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,760
downloaded from onedrive

754
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
you are getting the disk image the file

755
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,679
system

756
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,720
and now these car files

757
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
and that's a lot of that's a lot of

758
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,919
storage space

759
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
there are of course options in tomb

760
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,120
raider so you don't have to worry about

761
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,960
any storage space or as little as

762
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,240
possible you don't have to make a disk

763
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,159
image you can just read from it directly

764
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
if you're limited by space you can skip

765
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,880
the carving entirely you can just get

766
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
file system

767
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
you can literally run it with everything

768
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,159
disabled then it will say great

769
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,360
well i don't know why you did that but

770
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
great

771
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,480
so let's condense everything let's make

772
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,640
this a little bit smaller

773
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,000
and let the raid finally begin

774
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,080
we have our disk image

775
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,760
we have our file system

776
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
well we might not have our file system

777
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,799
that's the one we might not have just

778
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,640
because it might not be there and we

779
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,279
have our carved files

780
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
first thing we can do we can get rid of

781
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
the disk image now we already got an

782
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
image of it and if we are low on storage

783
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,399
space

784
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,679
we are going to get rid of the disk

785
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,679
image so that we don't have to worry

786
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,799
about it because the disk image is the

787
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,120
entire size of the drive

788
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,240
if you have a terabyte drive and you

789
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
only have 200 gigabytes on it it's going

790
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,559
to be a one terabyte file

791
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,159
if you have a library that's full of

792
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,679
that's full of books and a library

793
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,200
that's empty

794
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,120
they're going to still be a library

795
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
we don't want that so we get rid of it

796
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,760
if we can't fit a library

797
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,840
in our other library i guess um and then

798
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
we have our file system and carb files

799
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
that we want to combine with something

800
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
better

801
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,440
a tomb file system

802
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
which we can

803
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
raid

804
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
get it

805
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
yeah

806
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,080
uh and then we can continue with a more

807
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,960
efficient representation

808
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
so we're going to make a lot of upgrades

809
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
and changes for this for making it more

810
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
readable

811
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
we're going to start with flattening

812
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,159
everything into one directory instead of

813
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,000
having this massive tree structure we're

814
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,919
going to represent each

815
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
location of a file with its directories

816
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,480
it'll end up with a big file name but

817
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,320
this will also represent where it's from

818
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
without us having to go through every

819
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,559
single subfolder in every single folder

820
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
and so on trying to figure out where

821
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,600
something is

822
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
you'll just get a big list of everything

823
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
we'll also sanitize the file names

824
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
remove stuff that would break the

825
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,440
program because unicode is

826
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
god it's a nightmare we'll create an

827
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,559
index

828
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,279
and uh that will contain the file name

829
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,240
and the hash of the file name no

830
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,159
the hash of the content sorry about that

831
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,360
this should help make things a lot

832
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
easier but why do we need to get a hash

833
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,320
of the file contents for this index

834
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,279
well

835
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,320
first

836
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
a quick overview of hashing

837
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
hashing is

838
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
a one-way operation

839
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,960
if i have a hash function it's going to

840
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,039
generate a unique

841
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
identifier on the right

842
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
so if i have box on the left it's going

843
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,159
to produce that weird string of digits

844
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,840
on the right i hope you can see this in

845
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
the back sorry if you can't i'll narrate

846
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,919
um

847
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,360
and second we may have something like

848
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
the red fox jumps over the blue dog

849
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
which would also produce a different

850
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,679
operation even if we change a tiny bit

851
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,279
of it

852
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
it is going to produce an entirely

853
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
different result

854
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,399
now i know some of you are very fond of

855
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,480
cryptography i'll say hashing is not

856
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,159
encryption there

857
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,559
please don't kill me anyways hard to

858
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,880
find collisions in this function these

859
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,159
are the properties of a hashing function

860
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,240
there are pretty much two the third

861
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
one's kind of a repeat whatever i

862
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,279
digress

863
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,720
we use a hashing function to get

864
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
identifiers

865
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,159
the hashing function has several

866
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,279
properties

867
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,679
firstly it's hard to find collisions

868
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
it's hard to find one piece of data that

869
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
produces

870
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,320
the same output

871
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,640
as another piece of data

872
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,960
it would be hard very very hard for me

873
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
to find another sentence that will

874
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
produce the same output as the red fox

875
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
jumps over the blue dog

876
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,240
i'm sure if i tried very very hard and

877
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,919
used a lot of resources on something

878
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,679
that's not very secure i could and

879
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,520
people have

880
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,480
but

881
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
for our purposes we don't really care

882
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,480
about that

883
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,480
it's also hard to reverse

884
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,080
so if i just give you this random data

885
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
on the right

886
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
you can't really go back

887
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,039
and especially since these things tend

888
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
to be very very random or very very

889
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,840
different

890
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,120
you can't really determine much about

891
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,840
the input from the output

892
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,120
or really anything at all

893
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
so even if i have one modification like

894
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
a typo on the second line we're going to

895
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
get an entirely different output

896
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,679
why is this relevant at all so what

897
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,279
we're doing now and why is that useful

898
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,480
it seems like we would want to know the

899
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
input

900
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,760
well this produces a lot of very small

901
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,039
and for our purposes unique identifiers

902
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,279
for each of our books for each of our

903
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,519
files

904
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,919
these bot these books or files are just

905
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,840
data at this point they don't really

906
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,440
have file names

907
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
we only have an extension

908
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,279
so how do we name them in a way that we

909
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,440
can compare them to each other compare

910
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
them to stuff we already have

911
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
we use hashing

912
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,840
and specifically we use

913
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,600
md5 which is a fast

914
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,959
small and widely supported one

915
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,200
we use this to remove duplicates as well

916
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,320
as some other functions we'll get

917
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,919
through later

918
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,240
and

919
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,039
well why else would we do this

920
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,440
well to do that we'll cover about hash

921
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
sets

922
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,080
on the top right

923
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
on the top right just for the record i

924
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,399
usually keep the small stuff not the

925
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,440
stuff that's really small that you might

926
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,559
not be able to read it that's because

927
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
it's not that important

928
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
don't stress it in the top right there's

929
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,720
a bunch of hashes of random files and in

930
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,480
the bottom right we have a

931
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,960
bunch of different sets of hashes

932
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,279
of those of uh

933
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,279
known files

934
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,760
because some books are boring some books

935
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
are windows systems files some books are

936
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,519
log files some

937
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,559
of these files are not interesting

938
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,080
if you want them you can enable tomb

939
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,320
raider and it'll get them but most of us

940
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,679
don't really care about that if we're

941
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,039
trying to just get our own data back we

942
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,240
don't want to be

943
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
saying oh my

944
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,320
finally my uh collection of metallica

945
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
and it's just that tendon done from

946
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,679
windows booting up

947
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,399
so all these things really care about

948
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,840
but how does hashing come in

949
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,919
that bottom right picture

950
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
is of

951
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,640
what is known as the mist in irl

952
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
it is a wonderful online repository with

953
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,519
tons of known file files so these

954
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,120
windows system files they exist on

955
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,640
everyone's windows system there have

956
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
been lots of operating systems and we

957
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
know what files they have on them

958
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
so what do you do you get them all

959
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
together you collect them

960
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,120
and you provide them for anyone to use

961
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,840
by doing this you end up with a ton of

962
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,880
hashes of known boring files stuff that

963
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,039
we don't care about stuff that we can

964
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,519
ignore and save us some time defining

965
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,840
what we do care about

966
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
we use these sets to considerably reduce

967
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
the noise get rid of all that

968
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,159
garbo and get us some more important

969
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,519
stuff to continue onwards

970
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,880
any ideas for some pitfalls for this

971
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,799
where this might not exactly succeed

972
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,639
really ideas questions

973
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,240
well earlier we saw

974
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,159
we saw what happened with typos

975
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,919
even small modifications can produce

976
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,000
entirely different hashes

977
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,040
and

978
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,199
unfortunately if you're recovering data

979
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,159
you're going to end up with a lot of

980
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,040
productive data

981
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,760
so that's going to be entirely different

982
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,239
even if there's just one bite flipped

983
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,960
and it's not going to be in the hashtag

984
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
so

985
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,199
while this has been great it's basically

986
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
taken this massive library and removed

987
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
one of the bookshelves from it

988
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,119
we still have quite a lot so

989
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,440
what do we do from then well we sort it

990
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
as best we can so that we can comb

991
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,239
through it

992
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
and figure out

993
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,040
what

994
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,119
we want to figure out

995
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,199
based on a

996
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,320
better categories like music and videos

997
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,239
and

998
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,839
stuff that might have been on the

999
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,000
desktop or other stuff that was

1000
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
created later in the computer's time

1001
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,799
span if you can

1002
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,960
we already know how to classify and find

1003
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,680
what type of extension a file is using

1004
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,560
file

1005
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
classification

1006
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
using photorec from earlier

1007
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,680
and we can also create subclasses

1008
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
of those specific using those specific

1009
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
extensions like

1010
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
let's say we have

1011
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,880
a uh what's a good example

1012
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,160
you might have a png or jpg file

1013
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,400
and you might have gifs

1014
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,480
these are all subclasses of

1015
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
an image

1016
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
these are all lower on that hierarchy

1017
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,119
so we would want to sort them into

1018
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,599
different things

1019
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
just so we can more better look better

1020
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,119
and more easily look through them

1021
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,200
this is just extension classification

1022
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
we're simply taking the extensions and

1023
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,680
we can organize them into categories

1024
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,920
based on what type of extension they are

1025
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,240
it's nothing crazy

1026
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
it is however very tedious which is why

1027
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,760
tomb raider doesn't

1028
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
we can also use content classification

1029
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
we can open up the books we can look

1030
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
through them and figure out if it's a

1031
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,240
fiction a non-fiction book if it's a

1032
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,079
image if it's a

1033
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,079
piece of media if it is

1034
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,520
random noise and it doesn't actually

1035
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
seem like an image at all or rather a

1036
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,440
file at all

1037
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,480
and there's a lot of different ways of

1038
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,839
doing this for hours we use lid magic

1039
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,760
uh those who are familiar with linux

1040
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,520
will know this thing called the file

1041
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
command but

1042
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,599
it's not super relevant

1043
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,640
the point is that there's a lot of

1044
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
methods to determine the data

1045
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,760
type based on the data of the file

1046
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,800
determining

1047
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,920
what type of

1048
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,520
book this might be

1049
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,800
based on the pages

1050
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,839
we use both of

1051
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,040
them and afterwards we end up with

1052
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,200
something that is that represents our

1053
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,920
images our audio our

1054
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
video our

1055
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,079
document files our program files

1056
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,680
system files

1057
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,280
and so on

1058
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
we end up with an organized

1059
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
representation of data

1060
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,359
that was on the drive

1061
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,280
from this random massive assortment of

1062
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,960
images we end up

1063
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,839
with

1064
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,680
keep on calling your files images

1065
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,000
with this random assortment of files we

1066
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,680
end up with something that is our own

1067
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
directory structure our own better file

1068
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
system

1069
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
it also flags is for anomalies the best

1070
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,079
it can

1071
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,760
so if you have something that

1072
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
looks like a jpeg at first but then has

1073
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,839
a bunch of plain text in it

1074
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,200
well that's a little weird you should

1075
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,839
probably look into that

1076
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,760
it's not

1077
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,920
an extremely data forensics heavy

1078
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
approach

1079
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,200
but it can help save you some time if

1080
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,560
you're just looking for a quick scan

1081
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
over things after you've done data

1082
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,640
recovery

1083
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,160
so

1084
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,359
from then

1085
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,720
we have all this data what do we do with

1086
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,440
it

1087
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,119
well we can still add some other stuff

1088
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,400
to

1089
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
trim it down we can blacklist we can say

1090
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
hey i don't actually really care about

1091
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,839
program files at all

1092
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,520
i want to be really judicious about it

1093
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,359
and just get rid of all of them

1094
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,119
or i

1095
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,720
didn't have any music on this computer

1096
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,119
so let's just get rid of all of that too

1097
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,000
or uh let's say

1098
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,359
instead you're

1099
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,440
you're a photographer and you've lost

1100
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,599
your uh your hard drive got damaged and

1101
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,359
it has all your photos on it you don't

1102
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,800
care about program files you don't care

1103
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,920
about music

1104
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,480
all you want is to whitelist the images

1105
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,160
all you want is to get the images back

1106
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,799
from this drive

1107
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,440
additionally you could probably skip a

1108
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
lot of other steps you could skip the

1109
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
file carving if you can find the file

1110
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
system because you don't care about your

1111
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
deleted images

1112
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,920
you can skip the imaging process of the

1113
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
drive if you really want

1114
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,560
and you can skip every single every

1115
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
other thing too

1116
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,279
tomb raider allows you to do that

1117
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,760
and lastly it runs entirely on its own

1118
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,599
so once you start it running

1119
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,560
this operation which can take hours or

1120
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,160
even days to do

1121
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,520
all of this

1122
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
it will just go automatically

1123
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,599
i like to just start running uh the

1124
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,520
night before and then check on it for

1125
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
breakfast

1126
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,920
and find other uh

1127
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
craigs or other such content on there

1128
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
and uh

1129
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,480
be very confused

1130
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,520
so

1131
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,160
that is the walkthrough

1132
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,560
of what tomb raider does at the moment

1133
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,400
what is it going to do in the future

1134
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,520
a lot of

1135
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,839
this

1136
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,200
stuff i'm going to add as soon as i

1137
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,240
possibly can i've been a lot of my time

1138
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,359
recently has been focused on this

1139
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,119
presentation

1140
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:49,839
but

1141
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,920
first thing i'm going to do

1142
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,280
is rebuild a better version of the

1143
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
original file system this would be

1144
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,320
essentially a better library

1145
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
so instead of one that might be not very

1146
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,599
well kept

1147
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
a library or hard drive that is very

1148
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,440
disorganized

1149
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
we can make our own

1150
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,440
we can get rid of duplicate data

1151
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
we can have a better way of looking for

1152
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
what we want faster

1153
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
a lot of times computers seem to have a

1154
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,920
very hard time

1155
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,880
finding

1156
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,079
files in massive massive sets

1157
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,839
which frankly doesn't really make sense

1158
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,839
to me

1159
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,280
because we can always do other stuff

1160
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,160
like uh what's it

1161
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,960
create an index

1162
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,480
yeah

1163
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,000
but anyways

1164
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,640
we can replace duplicates of files with

1165
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
links to those files we can get rid of

1166
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,319
these long file paths these things that

1167
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,640
are under a ton of different folders

1168
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,040
we can

1169
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,800
include the files that we otherwise

1170
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,960
would have had deleted

1171
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,359
and we cannot compress stuff this is all

1172
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,240
just lovely nice to have afterwards i'm

1173
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
working on this now

1174
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,800
it works just fine already

1175
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,160
i promise

1176
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,319
and these are features that i'm planning

1177
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,319
on adding back so if you had

1178
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,480
a system that was damaged or destroyed

1179
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,319
you could plug and play and it would be

1180
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,400
exactly like you remembered it rather

1181
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
than just being something for

1182
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,319
exploration

1183
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
otherwise i'm thinking of adding an

1184
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,040
entropy classification this is uh

1185
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,160
entropy is a measure of how random

1186
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
a file or set

1187
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,839
of data is

1188
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,680
so a random number very high entropy

1189
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,640
but a

1190
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,319
shakespeare's works low entropy

1191
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,760
this is useful to us because we can

1192
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,200
compute a number zero to eight that

1193
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,079
actually measures the entropy

1194
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,079
and

1195
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,079
use that number to maybe determine if

1196
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,599
something is noise or not noise

1197
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,680
which is great right that sounds very

1198
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,119
useful why didn't we use this earlier

1199
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,319
well

1200
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,480
there's a bit of a problem with that

1201
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,319
unfortunately that uh

1202
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,800
a lot of file formats

1203
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
like encryption encrypted file formats

1204
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,680
are very good at encrypting

1205
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,480
they

1206
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,319
produce things that have very high

1207
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,599
entropy

1208
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,880
very high

1209
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,359
seemingly random

1210
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,960
data

1211
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,440
so you might have eight for completely

1212
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,520
random noise

1213
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,880
which is actually kind of hard to get

1214
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,640
because nothing is ever completely

1215
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,000
random

1216
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,960
and you might have 7.99997

1217
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,160
for an encrypted file or a compressed

1218
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,359
file

1219
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,119
because of course it wants to try and

1220
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,920
take this long organized data and

1221
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
compress it into a very compact

1222
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
unique representation

1223
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,119
additionally on another note

1224
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,920
the file formats we use for images and

1225
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,400
uh audio mp3 and jpg

1226
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
are also very good at compressing so

1227
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
they're basically the same

1228
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,359
so

1229
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,280
i didn't use this in tomb raider because

1230
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,839
i kept on finding that there was just uh

1231
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,839
too many false positives

1232
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,000
but i'm still working on it and i am

1233
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,079
hoping i can use it to filter out the

1234
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,359
signal-to-noise ratio a little bit

1235
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,000
better

1236
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,240
so uh

1237
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
yeah that's it everybody

1238
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
that is uh now uh i guess it's time for

1239
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,280
the qa and resources

1240
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,000
we use a ton of software for this

1241
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
for uh tomb raider and i

1242
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,960
special thanks to all of these amazing

1243
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,119
places for the wonderful software and

1244
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
wonderful data sets i got to use to make

1245
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,760
this thing work

1246
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,359
and put together a lot of pieces that

1247
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,160
would have taken me ages to do otherwise

1248
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
additionally uh

1249
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,960
special thanks to everyone who throws

1250
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,880
away hard drives without destroying them

1251
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,119
scott moulton noise bridge the

1252
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,240
hackerspace and lastly lowercroft thank

1253
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,839
you tomb raider

1254
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,119
uh so yeah i guess i said that was it

1255
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,119
and then i had some more to say but uh

1256
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
any questions

1257
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,599
yo can you come up to the microphone so

1258
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,200
they can hear you

1259
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,400
if you have like if you have questions

1260
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,240
can you guys come up to that microphone

1261
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,280
and

1262
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,599
ask i'd love to answer them what's up so

1263
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,560
big files with the high entropy are

1264
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
probably compressed wait no i'm sorry

1265
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
can you big files with high entropy are

1266
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,359
probably compressed small files with

1267
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,200
high entry might be interesting things

1268
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,640
like ssh keys i agree

1269
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,800
so they said uh big files might be

1270
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,560
something that's compressed

1271
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
uh and have high entropy small files

1272
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
might be something like ssh keys or

1273
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,040
stuff that's important

1274
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,160
i agree thank you and

1275
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,960
at the moment that's actually covered by

1276
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,079
the tools that we already use for

1277
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,599
classifying so the content

1278
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,200
classification and extension

1279
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,880
classification that would look for dot

1280
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,760
key or dot pem files

1281
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,599
works really well and i find those all

1282
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,200
the time they're like one of the most

1283
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,359
common things i find uh

1284
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,599
along with shadow files which are fun to

1285
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,880
test out

1286
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,560
on another note but

1287
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
yes i agree and uh that's part of the

1288
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,319
reason i want to implement it so i can

1289
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,280
use that sort of stuff to

1290
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,800
shorten things down or at least provide

1291
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
an option saying i for those who want to

1292
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,640
use it and say

1293
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,400
really really really crank down on the

1294
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,680
noise

1295
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
in which case they could just remove all

1296
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
of the uh

1297
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,960
um

1298
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,280
files with a higher entropy

1299
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,599
anyways yeah what's up

1300
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,480
so uh i first i just want to say that

1301
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,760
this is awesome this is so cool thanks

1302
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,119
so much i really appreciate it it's i i

1303
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,440
i i really love it and it's been a lot

1304
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,319
of fun making it so thank you so much

1305
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,680
and my question is uh when when did you

1306
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,000
start approaching this as a signal to

1307
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,319
noise ratio problem

1308
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,200
and what did you use to kind of get

1309
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
yourself there

1310
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,720
when did i start

1311
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,960
treating this as a signal-to-noise ratio

1312
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,920
problem

1313
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
and what did i do

1314
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,680
after that

1315
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
to like work from it okay

1316
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,760
um

1317
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
basically i would recover data and there

1318
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,760
would just be so much there would just

1319
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,400
be tons of tons of files and even on

1320
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,319
stuff where

1321
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,520
i knew

1322
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,440
more or less what it was or what would

1323
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,880
be there because i would find the file

1324
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,640
system and i could look and see what

1325
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,560
were actually documents or downloads it

1326
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,680
would just be

1327
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,359
some office computer

1328
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,520
uh there would still be like a massive

1329
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,440
amount of windows files that would just

1330
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,599
dwarf any of the user data

1331
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,240
um at that point i was looking through

1332
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,160
it and i was spending all my time

1333
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,319
trying to find actual relevant data and

1334
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:39,680
stuff that was

1335
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,400
added by the user not by the computer

1336
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,839
um

1337
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,920
that i was like i gotta work on

1338
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,440
improving this so i spent a lot of time

1339
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,040
a lot yeah there was a lot of time spent

1340
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,200
on tomb raider just doing that and uh

1341
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,720
working on shortening it down making it

1342
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,079
so that you can actually process it

1343
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,200
because

1344
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,480
there are a lot of tools the tomb raider

1345
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,839
uses

1346
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,000
these problems are not you know unsolved

1347
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,240
for recovering data

1348
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,440
and

1349
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,640
the problem is that people don't know

1350
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,040
how to use them and they produce so much

1351
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,200
noise that they can't really use them

1352
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,480
and that's why i made this i wanted

1353
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,440
people

1354
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,280
i want to do all to have a tool that you

1355
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,520
can use where you can just plug and play

1356
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,680
and run it on any sort of hardware

1357
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,839
i am so looking forward to using this

1358
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,440
thanks again for the presentation i

1359
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,000
really appreciate it

1360
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
so i looked up your tool before the the

1361
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
conference when the description for the

1362
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,079
talk was posted

1363
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,920
it looks super great it looks like a

1364
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,000
really awesome wrapper around a lot of

1365
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
other tools that we all use very

1366
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,079
frequently and so i'm excited not to

1367
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,720
have to do it all manually anymore um

1368
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,400
but i couldn't find any good

1369
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
descriptions on how to use the tool or

1370
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,079
how to set it up especially where it

1371
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,680
uses so many different tools you

1372
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,160
probably got it set up just right

1373
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,440
kind of what's the process you're

1374
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
looking at and creating that kind of

1375
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,559
documentation so we can actually go and

1376
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,359
use this absolutely so they brought up a

1377
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,960
very good point and it is that when they

1378
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,160
looked up the

1379
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
tool like a few weeks ago

1380
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,000
a few weeks ago it didn't have as good

1381
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,079
documentation uh

1382
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,559
you're totally right it's because i was

1383
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,200
making these slides and uh

1384
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,319
i am

1385
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,040
i have updated the readme since then to

1386
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,640
and other documentation to make that

1387
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,839
better and support more stuff

1388
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,200
now when i'm done with this presentation

1389
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,480
i'm going to be improving that even

1390
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,559
further and continuing my development on

1391
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,160
that uh in my free time so

1392
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
you're totally right and i'm sorry i

1393
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,079
wasn't there earlier but thank you for

1394
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,599
looking i'm glad you checked it out um

1395
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,960
i guess i didn't expect anyone to be

1396
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,119
looking at it much earlier so it caught

1397
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,440
me off guard but i will uh i'll be

1398
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,119
improving it a lot more i've already

1399
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,520
added some documentation on these steps

1400
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,960
and some usage and installation

1401
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,480
instructions

1402
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,520
thank you my pleasure thank you

1403
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
um any other questions does anyone else

1404
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,280
want to add we have a lot of we still

1405
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,319
actually have a lot of time i'm a little

1406
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,920
bit early so

1407
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,160
if anyone wants to know about uh stuff

1408
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,640
that wasn't very clear

1409
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,520
uh

1410
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,559
any possible future features

1411
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,839
bring it i'd love to hear about it

1412
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,160
hiya hi so for some of the maybe more

1413
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,440
interesting things you found like the

1414
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,880
diagrams

1415
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,480
sure the like the diagrams you found the

1416
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,559
architectural diagrams for the uh the

1417
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,119
water system have you done any reporting

1418
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,400
to the

1419
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,079
owner of that data or thought about how

1420
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,680
you might do some haven't been able to

1421
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,520
try i haven't been able to find the

1422
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,880
owner of the data

1423
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,839
also

1424
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,640
fortunately those diagrams

1425
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,920
were

1426
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,960
they seemed to be

1427
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,839
yeah they weren't they didn't seem there

1428
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,160
wasn't any actual compromising data for

1429
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,480
their systems on there just interesting

1430
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,079
stuff regarding the technical

1431
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,079
specifications of how ferries worked and

1432
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,599
how the san francisco water transit

1433
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,079
authority ran their system that's a very

1434
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,400
good question though i have reached out

1435
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,960
to a lot of owners of these drives

1436
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,520
um when i found like

1437
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
when i'll find all their data on them

1438
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,559
and i'll just be like

1439
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,960
oh wow there's like an entire

1440
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,480
this is this person's life these are

1441
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,920
family pictures and so on um oh

1442
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
yeah now to clarify the question you

1443
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
asked was have i contacted the water

1444
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,359
transit authority

1445
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,359
about this data anyways

1446
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,319
sorry i didn't say that earlier

1447
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,160
there have been a lot of people that

1448
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,440
i've found

1449
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,359
their hard drive and i have been able to

1450
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,280
find contact info

1451
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,760
tried reaching out um

1452
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,839
unfortunately usually they don't respond

1453
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,160
or they or it's out of date information

1454
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,079
because it's been in the dump for years

1455
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,400
and i just randomly dug it up but um

1456
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
yeah

1457
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
i also run a side business doing this so

1458
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,839
i can more like directly

1459
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,920
help people and help get them get their

1460
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,040
data back

1461
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
without it being any like problems with

1462
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,480
other big problems

1463
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,000
uh what's up do you have a question i

1464
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,599
actually do have a question

1465
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,800
i was interested to know only because

1466
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
you're so intimate with the topic uh

1467
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,480
what is the current state of backlog in

1468
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,559
like organizations who are trying to get

1469
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,119
through these petabytes of data

1470
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,880
using these kind of tools and are you

1471
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,640
finding the tools have been effective

1472
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,720
and trying to help them or

1473
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,240
it's been a few years since i've looked

1474
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
at the numbers as to the backlog

1475
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,480
the backlog for

1476
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
for example uh when uh they're trying to

1477
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,480
uh uh government agencies or uh local

1478
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,000
law enforcement are trying to go ahead

1479
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,559
and create a case against somebody using

1480
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,640
the digital forensics and there's

1481
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,040
usually these backlogs of years

1482
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,880
sometimes to try and get out a hard

1483
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,359
drive through for analysis because it's

1484
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,559
so manual in many say in many ways

1485
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,400
that's a really good question thank you

1486
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
um

1487
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,359
so they asked

1488
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,960
what does it look like

1489
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,559
for

1490
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,559
existing

1491
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,800
enterprise implementations of data

1492
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,079
recovery and digital forensics

1493
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,359
i can only give an approximate

1494
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,200
representation because i

1495
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,280
do not i have not worked as a digital

1496
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,800
forensics person

1497
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,640
this has just been my fun

1498
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,359
learner to do data recovery thing um

1499
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,760
however i do i did get familiar with

1500
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,000
that because my roommate works says

1501
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,760
does digital forensics

1502
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,160
and i was like hey

1503
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,599
what do you think of this

1504
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,680
and they were like oh that's great

1505
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,559
and

1506
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,880
um

1507
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,880
and uh

1508
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,800
so i guess my answer take this with a

1509
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,319
grain of salt um i think they just

1510
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,000
pay for the time

1511
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,280
they just spend a lot of time going

1512
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,440
through stuff they have to do

1513
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,359
some stuff in the manual fashion because

1514
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,119
they have to keep

1515
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,960
because it's just such a strict legal

1516
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,559
process

1517
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,520
so

1518
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
like

1519
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,119
full disclosure you couldn't just be

1520
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,079
like

1521
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,160
uh

1522
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,839
your honor

1523
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,160
here's my here's my rated tune

1524
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,720
a rest that man like that's not really

1525
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,640
how it works exactly you have to use

1526
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,319
like the original image you can use all

1527
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,599
this stuff

1528
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,760
but you also have resources

1529
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,440
and you're still gonna have to look

1530
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,280
through tons of files and you're still

1531
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,480
going to have to try and recover all

1532
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,160
this old data

1533
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,520
why not save yourself some time and

1534
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,200
automate the hell out of it and find as

1535
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
much of it as you can immediately using

1536
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,000
this

1537
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,599
that's what i made it for

1538
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,839
not as a first as a very good first step

1539
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,720
for that and a final full

1540
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,960
solution for anyone else

1541
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,400
so thank you for the question it's very

1542
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
good uh what's up

1543
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,800
so when the when the hackers all go back

1544
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,319
home and everyone's in their local

1545
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,880
municipality yes where do you suggest we

1546
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,440
look for busted hard drives

1547
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,240
that's an amazing question

1548
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,079
oh i love that question okay so when

1549
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,079
hackers go home

1550
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,400
okay i have two minutes uh

1551
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,920
when

1552
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,240
hackers go home how do they find hard

1553
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,680
drives

1554
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,920
it's a great great question so it

1555
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,119
depends what

1556
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,160
there are some places where you for the

1557
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,000
dump specifically

1558
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,160
you usually have to know people to be

1559
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,839
able to like look in the dump and find

1560
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,960
them

1561
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,079
i know people uh and made friends with

1562
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,520
the friends of people who look at the

1563
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,559
dog which is great um however

1564
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,400
that's awesome there's tons of ways so i

1565
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,440
only have so much time so i'll go

1566
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
through some of them

1567
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,119
ebay

1568
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,400
tons of stuff you just look for the ones

1569
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,280
that are like broken or for parts and

1570
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,599
then you just can buy like a stack of 20

1571
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,040
of them that are from laptops for like

1572
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,520
50 bucks it's the best um

1573
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,799
you can go to garage sales you can go to

1574
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,040
um

1575
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,119
old offices they're always throwing away

1576
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,799
computers

1577
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,119
you can go to places that have e-waste

1578
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,839
which is also old offices and other

1579
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,680
companies and

1580
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,119
if they have public access to their

1581
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,079
e-waste which sometimes they actually do

1582
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,280
and it's a little bit

1583
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,440
annoying if you work at a place that has

1584
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,640
e-waste just go there

1585
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
and then you can find a lot of hard

1586
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,960
drives and other such things in there

1587
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,720
if you find any anywhere you might find

1588
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,160
broken computers broken computers

1589
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,040
usually have hard drives um so i went to

1590
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,960
noisebridge special thanks to them which

1591
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,160
is a hackerspace

1592
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,760
to translate that just means that it is

1593
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,920
a big workshop for anyone who wants to

1594
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,799
build stuff hack stuff and people donate

1595
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,559
stuff to it all the time they have they

1596
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,480
had tons of just broken computers and

1597
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,640
shelves of them and i would just be like

1598
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,240
all right time to go get some hard

1599
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,079
drives and they used to have a lot of

1600
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,760
hard drives in those dead computers now

1601
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,319
they're all mine and i am uh using them

1602
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,240
for practicing and for testing this and

1603
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,359
practicing this um don't worry i'm i'm

1604
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,880
i'm not i'm not actually taking all of

1605
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,119
them because people should have on them

1606
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,760
and do their own stuff with it um

1607
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,160
so yeah

1608
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,799
oh cool okay

1609
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,640
all right i'll take an hour to explain

1610
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,279
the rest of this question then um so

1611
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,599
yeah hacker spaces are basically

1612
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:08,799
workshops where you can do that yadda

1613
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,440
yadda and uh

1614
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,119
people just donate spare computer parts

1615
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,119
to those you can go through those find

1616
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,599
hard drives garage sales people just

1617
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,200
throw away old computers because they

1618
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,400
don't work

1619
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,559
and it's because the hardware is broken

1620
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,480
or you know broken

1621
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,440
um

1622
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,160
you can go to

1623
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,160
what's it what was it uh craigslist

1624
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,280
lots of old stuff there crisis is like

1625
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,720
i swear craigslist is like the black

1626
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,160
market but it's like not the black

1627
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,920
market you can find everything there um

1628
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,599
what was it going to say about garage

1629
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,440
sales just um you can go through the

1630
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,240
literal trash of places that are near um

1631
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,240
corporations that's not very fun though

1632
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,359
because you can usually find them in a

1633
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,680
lot more convenient places anywhere

1634
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,359
where there are people gathering to do a

1635
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,040
lot of tech

1636
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,520
there will probably be

1637
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,000
broken computers somewhere around there

1638
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,799
and you can just say hey can i try and

1639
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,240
fix your hard drive

1640
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,400
and a lot of time it's like

1641
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,839
what do they have to lose

1642
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,359
if they just have a broken computer that

1643
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,960
they've given up on

1644
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,200
and you could fix it even if you don't

1645
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,480
fix it they're gonna be totally fine

1646
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,640
with that um a lot of the time so just

1647
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,280
uh ask around look for places where

1648
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,040
there are tons of

1649
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
leftover computers

1650
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,160
something else i'm thinking of i can't

1651
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,680
really remember at the moment um
