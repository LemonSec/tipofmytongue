1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
so welcome to Higher Ground and welcome

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,359
to being back in person it is so amazing

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,280
seeing everybody

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,519
uh it is so amazing that besides Las

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,139
Vegas actually did this virtually last

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,240
year as well my name is Kathleen Smith

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,180
I'm the lead for Higher Ground we've had

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,880
Higher Ground for seven years because we

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,220
know that people will talk about that

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,680
there's this Workforce shortage but

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,420
other than throwing a lot of job

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,279
descriptions at it a lot of people are

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,859
not changing the conversation so this is

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,020
a safe place for you to be able to have

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,239
those conversations what do I do with my

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,219
resume what do I do with this how do I

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,340
do interviewing what do I do mapping as

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,219
far as my career is concerned so today

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,440
we will have three great presentations

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,620
10 30 11 30 and 2 and then at one

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,899
o'clock we also have recruiters from the

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,820
industry that I trust

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,120
and career coaches that I trust coming

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,820
in to meet with you and talk with you

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,280
one-on-one about those sessions so I

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,379
really wanted to kick off this present

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,720
kickoff higher ground with a

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
presentation about career mapping

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,979
because when you talk about your career

30
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,500
a lot of people move from position to

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,280
position just looking for the new title

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,520
or the new salary rather than how do you

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,040
develop as a professional how do you

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,380
develop to The Next Step that will

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,479
fulfill you as a career professional

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,939
rather than just fitting in the next

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,460
cubicle so with that I would like to

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,680
introduce Steve winterfeld on his

39
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,659
presentation on a career in cyber

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,740
security thank you

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,840
foreign

42
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,460
my background I started off in the

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,920
military I built a

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,200
a computer Emergency Response Center a

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,380
sock for the Army

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,180
then I went into the doretta defense

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,680
Contracting

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,960
so I stepped halfway out of the military

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,780
for a while

50
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,740
did a lot of certifications

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,340
accreditation did the compliance stuff

52
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,120
taught a course on being a cyber Warrior

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,920
basically we're teaching admins how to

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,480
break into systems

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
so because the problem is

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
good Builders build things to work

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
and they don't want to break them they

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,140
don't think about how to break them they

59
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,720
don't think about how to abuse them and

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,760
so they just built things to work not

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,980
build things to be safe

62
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,640
uh switched over uh went to Nordstrom's

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,940
uh my wife is still mad that I left that

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,980
discount

65
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,400
um ran their Bank Nordstrom had a bank

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,500
for a while for a long time they were

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,239
one of the last two retailers to have

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,000
their own bank nurses and Cabela's were

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,099
the last two and they both got rid of

70
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,659
their Banks because the regulation was

71
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,120
too burdensome uh then I went over to

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,580
Charles Schwab and built out the threat

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,860
intelligence and incident response

74
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,959
the reason I'm so passionate about today

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,720
is I got caught up in a riff

76
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,159
and

77
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,739
I was just kind of doing like most of us

78
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,500
do my career was managed by what

79
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,840
opportunity came in front of me

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,099
and suddenly the company shrank the ctoi

81
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,260
and a bunch of others were looking for a

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,080
job and and so I really had to sit down

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,360
and think about what I wanted to do did

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,040
I want to stay in defense contract and

85
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,780
get out and all those kind of things so

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,360
I want to share that kind of a journey

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,640
and some of those experiences

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
and so today we're going to do three

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,299
things we're going to talk about people

90
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,040
coming into the career how should you

91
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,959
advise them what you should you think

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,120
about when you're coming in how do you

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,420
build a stronger you for your career and

94
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,400
then how do you figure out where you

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,939
want to go

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
so the first thing is somebody's coming

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,659
to you and they're like I hear cyber

98
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,060
security makes a lot of money

99
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,720
I wanna I wanna get into cyber security

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
so I generally kind of talk to the

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,019
person about

102
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,360
where would they fit where would they be

103
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,400
successful

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
um you know if I would have been put

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,579
into compliance right away I don't know

106
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,399
that I would have been successful

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,139
I'm happier in a an analyst role

108
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,320
uh and so I got lucky in the first job I

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
was offered was an analyst role so again

110
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,259
I don't know I didn't manage my career

111
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,720
as much as take advantage of

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,220
opportunities

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,840
and so

114
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,300
um do you like to build things

115
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,800
do you like to design do you like to go

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,320
home having accomplished something

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,419
there are a lot of us that spend days

118
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,460
and go home and not necessarily have

119
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,560
something we accomplished that week that

120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,639
month

121
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
Builders love to get things done

122
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,740
building has kind of changed lately

123
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,539
devops has changed that to some degree

124
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,340
and

125
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,139
you know more and more of our Builders

126
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,759
have to be coders

127
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,740
used to be you would come in and you

128
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
would build a server and put

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,840
you know file Integrity Management on

130
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,240
This Server you would put data loss

131
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
prevention on This Server you have

132
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,860
antivirus agents being managed by this

133
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,520
server and I managed systems I manage

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
different things like that

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,259
that is changing

136
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,880
um and I will tell you the one thing

137
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,000
that is true about cyber security

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,060
what would you guess the half-life of a

139
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,440
cyber security skill is

140
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,740
six months I would say 18 months for

141
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,080
most cyber security skills if you don't

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,300
like to adapt learn and change this is

143
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,180
not a fun career field

144
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,840
so I'm talking to my Engineers now about

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,759
are they going to become developers are

146
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,500
they going to become Cloud Architects

147
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,380
are they going to come coders what are

148
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,780
they going to be to be relevant

149
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,300
in two years

150
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,120
the next thing is I don't really have

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
technical skills I don't want to sit in

152
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
a keyboard and look at code I don't want

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,780
to look at incidents anybody that's

154
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,000
watches incidents scroll across the

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,979
security operations center a sock screen

156
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,020
knows what I'm talking about

157
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,759
you know there's a role for you

158
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,680
compliance is incredibly important and

159
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,840
so one of the people on my team when I

160
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
was doing major incident response

161
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,460
was

162
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,759
they had to design the program to

163
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,100
respond to an incident if we had a data

164
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,580
breach they designed that plant

165
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,220
there was a person on my team whose sole

166
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,919
responsibility was to tell me whether or

167
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
not I was following the plan

168
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,660
so as a CSO one of the things I worry

169
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,599
about is after the breach I'm going to

170
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,639
have two things show up

171
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,340
in banking one is the regulators and the

172
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,020
other is a

173
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,520
class action lawsuit

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
and in class action lawsuit I'm

175
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,580
literally thinking about

176
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,639
what evidence do they have access to

177
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,319
my forensic company reports to my lawyer

178
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,479
so they have

179
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,699
um confidentiality

180
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,620
and there's that lawyer client in the

181
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,599
forensic report may not be able to pull

182
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,940
into the class action lawsuit

183
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,180
my policy can be discovered

184
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,800
and now they're going to say did I

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
follow my policy I literally have a

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,660
person on my team saying hey you're not

187
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,479
following your own policy

188
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
so I mean those people are incredibly

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,139
important

190
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,520
uh

191
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,560
PCI audit how many people have been

192
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,759
through a PCI audit

193
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,080
that is so much fun

194
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,300
250 some checklist items to make sure

195
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,740
that you're handling credit cards

196
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,840
correctly

197
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,599
I need the audit team the compliance

198
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,240
team to make sure when the the PCI audit

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,639
comes annually or biannually

200
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,280
that we're going to pass

201
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
and so these are people that are

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,539
involved in strategy these are people

203
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,419
that are involved in actual incidents

204
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,300
they're not your audit team

205
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,640
they're part of your security team and

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,979
it's it's a very important job

207
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,059
now

208
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,179
the last is your analysts

209
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,399
so what is an analyst

210
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,459
your sock operator somebody that day in

211
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,860
and day out is looking at indicators of

212
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,920
compromise alerts and responding to them

213
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,060
your

214
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,640
um incident response team which is

215
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,100
different than your sock operator

216
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,560
your forensics team

217
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,540
your

218
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,399
um

219
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,019
penetration testing team

220
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,660
of all the tabs I've talked about who do

221
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,040
you think works the longest hours

222
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,339
incident response

223
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,200
your analysts or some of the law are

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
probably working you know when law 4J

225
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
comes out

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,120
the sock is fully engaged the pen

227
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,580
testers are testing

228
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,660
uh your vulnerability team is running

229
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,640
your com and so

230
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
at three o'clock on Friday

231
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,120
because that's when every zero day pops

232
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
if you're in operations if you're in an

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,940
analyst these are probably the longest

234
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,680
hours

235
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,380
so it's again it's kind of this balance

236
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,620
of what do you want out of your career

237
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,980
do you want to go do your job be done at

238
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,079
five go home

239
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,899
compliance is your best bet

240
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,000
those people have fewer crises than

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,420
you know we just got a patch so we need

242
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,459
the engineers here this weekend to push

243
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,959
the log 4J patch

244
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,420
any thoughts anything any questions

245
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,820
before I kind of move off of how I talk

246
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,380
to somebody about what they might want

247
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,880
to do in cyber security

248
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,420
all right I've either bored everybody

249
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,000
into Comas or I'm doing well

250
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,380
I was a mortar platoon leader you're

251
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,700
going to have to take off your mask

252
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,640
to get into compliance what skills or

253
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,260
what do you need

254
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,360
um

255
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,000
actually the compliance people I'm the

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,880
most happy with have writing backgrounds

257
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,980
they can they can give me competent

258
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,540
documents

259
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,640
uh so I tend to look to that first uh

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,079
I'll take people out of audit

261
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,060
backgrounds

262
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,800
um a lot of people come in and they're

263
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,560
very solid from that

264
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,120
um

265
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,860
those are probably be the first two

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,360
things I personally think about

267
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,620
so the next thing you're in your your

268
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,240
career

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,140
and so again I have three things

270
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,019
I have three sections with three things

271
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,399
in each I did not do that by Design

272
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,380
and this one is

273
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,899
the first thing is if you're a

274
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,760
compliance analyst

275
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,680
what do you need to be an expert in

276
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,500
what you're doing

277
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,720
so when I was at the bank

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,540
I had compliance experts

279
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,079
who had not read the ffiec

280
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,860
the ffic is the governing document for

281
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,600
banks

282
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,639
and I'm like how are you on the

283
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,680
compliance team and you haven't read the

284
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,639
regulation that you're responsible for

285
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,399
it it's just

286
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,320
negligence

287
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,240
you need to be an expert in whatever

288
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,920
you're doing

289
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,459
that means continuous learning it means

290
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,860
constantly coming up with ways to think

291
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,920
about thank you what you need to do and

292
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,760
so

293
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,980
being an expert

294
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,139
um constant training constant

295
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,459
development

296
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm going to drop down to the bottom

297
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,680
here

298
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,040
every six months I pick a new topic that

299
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
I want to be an expert in

300
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,540
last year my entire year was devoted to

301
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,940
artificial intelligence

302
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,579
the first six months of this year

303
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,380
was devoted to the industry of fintech

304
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,180
and there's fintech and there's

305
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,100
Insurance Tech and there is regtech

306
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,980
but what is what does all this mean what

307
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,959
is this doing how does it affect the

308
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,940
market and how we're approaching the

309
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,019
market at Akamai

310
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,399
the next thing is you have to understand

311
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,860
how to be a good partner so this next

312
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,779
six months I'm actually studying

313
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,300
marketing

314
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,079
um

315
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,500
it is it is hard for me to study

316
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,540
something that I'm not excited about

317
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,940
but if I want to be a good partner

318
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,820
I already know what the CFO does because

319
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,160
I studied that early in my career

320
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,199
I already know what you know a lot of my

321
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,360
partners does so I I said what is the

322
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,420
weakest stool what is the weakest leg in

323
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,399
my stool and I said it's marketing so

324
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,459
for six months I've got a mentor

325
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,459
it's the head of marketing in Akamai

326
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,440
who's now in another company but still

327
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,060
my mentor

328
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,779
um

329
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,579
and

330
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,959
I'm becoming a an expert with my partner

331
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,620
um so you have to be good at what you do

332
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,380
the next is you have to be able to lead

333
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,899
now there are two things you can lead

334
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,600
you can manage a project

335
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,339
or a product

336
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,279
or you can manage a team

337
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,079
very few people are going to be able to

338
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,420
get through their entire career

339
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,240
and not manage either

340
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,579
if you're just pounding out code all the

341
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,740
time you're probably still managing your

342
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,420
projects

343
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,699
uh right now you're you're going to go

344
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,760
get certified as a scrum master

345
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,320
and that's how you're going to manage

346
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,720
that's the certificate and the

347
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,279
leadership style that you're going to

348
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,820
leverage in in some companies

349
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,760
but you have to be able to lead and so

350
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
what does that take

351
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,480
um

352
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,339
how many people would like to come up

353
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,019
here and take my place and be in front

354
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,740
of people speaking

355
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,079
some some are comfortable there

356
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,959
I had an analyst and I said listen if if

357
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,420
you want to move forward you're going to

358
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,740
have to be able to share your thoughts

359
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,820
you're going to have to be able to get

360
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,079
in front of the group

361
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
you're gonna have to stand in front of

362
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,740
the CEO the CFO and the ciso and tell

363
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,019
them why you think we had a data breach

364
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,339
or

365
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,459
I'm going to do that and you're going to

366
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,959
sit there and not get credit for what

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,980
you did

368
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm fine doing that for you but if you

369
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,139
want to grow if you want the job I have

370
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,079
you got to be able to stand up here

371
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,120
and he went to

372
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,800
um Toastmasters

373
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,600
which I was surprised is still around

374
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,639
and still doing well and Toastmasters

375
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,019
got him to the point where he could go

376
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,500
do that he developed the skill to be a

377
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,459
leader

378
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,519
to stand in front to share his ideas to

379
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,100
fight for what he thought

380
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,660
um

381
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,060
there are a number of books out there on

382
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,680
how to be a leader there are a number of

383
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,279
ways you can do it uh a common way I've

384
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,860
encouraged my team is if you don't want

385
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,420
to do it at work go volunteer

386
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,639
um you can be on the b-sides here they

387
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,980
need members of their committee there

388
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,839
are so many places you can go volunteer

389
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,120
to develop your skills

390
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,360
project management

391
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,019
there are just a ton of certifications

392
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,320
how many people have heard of PMP

393
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
how many have a PMP

394
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,839
you know it's it's another we'll talk

395
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,360
about certifications and how useful or

396
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,459
useless they are later but

397
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,259
again it's another way to go get

398
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,320
certified to develop your skill set

399
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,720
for me sometimes I need an artificial

400
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,579
deadline

401
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,680
like when I said I was going to study

402
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,740
artificial intelligence after two months

403
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,439
do you know how much time I spent

404
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,599
studying artificial intelligence

405
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,939
yeah I saw a couple zeros it was pretty

406
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,799
close to zero

407
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,140
it was pretty close to zero

408
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,500
so I went out and I I signed up for a

409
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,720
course to give myself an artificial

410
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,079
deadline because I know I need that

411
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,319
yeah

412
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,380
yep I like that you know if you put your

413
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,059
money up you're more likely to follow

414
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,320
through

415
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,360
uh even if it's a company's money the

416
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,220
company's gonna hold you accountable so

417
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,840
yeah

418
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,340
um that and that's what it was for me it

419
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,380
was that artificial deadline

420
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,940
now

421
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,280
um marketing I'm doing fine because

422
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,440
again I have a mentor

423
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,320
and I have a meeting with my mentor and

424
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,700
they're going to say did you do what you

425
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,740
said you were going to do

426
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,600
and because I picked a mentor I have

427
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,340
respect for I'm really not going to show

428
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,679
up to that meeting and be like no I blew

429
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,780
off everything we agreed to

430
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,840
um

431
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,480
but how to become a great leader

432
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,440
um

433
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,539
the other thing is how to get rid of bad

434
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,160
habits

435
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,760
so my first leadership job was in a very

436
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,460
specific industry

437
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,559
I was an Airborne Ranger

438
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,020
a lieutenant in the Infantry

439
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,000
and it comes with a very specific

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,740
leadership style

441
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,140
I am now pleasantly surprised when

442
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,820
people are surprised I was in the

443
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,500
military

444
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,720
it took a while to get rid of bad

445
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,760
leadership styles

446
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
and you can learn as much from a bad

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,620
leader as a good leader things you don't

448
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,820
want to do

449
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,660
but again what's your goal

450
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,059
and the last is

451
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,980
if you don't understand how your company

452
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,780
makes money

453
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,780
can you tell me what the risk is to any

454
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,299
incident that happens

455
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,520
no

456
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,140
so

457
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,419
how many people subscribe to CFO

458
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,960
magazine

459
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,919
I mean why not why aren't you learning

460
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,799
what your company cares about

461
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,780
if you want it by the way if you want to

462
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,880
get money out of the CFO for your next

463
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,960
project

464
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
you should speak the same language he

465
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,059
speaks

466
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,240
you know so again understanding how your

467
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,620
company makes Revenue reading your 10K

468
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,580
understanding if there's a cyber

469
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,799
statement in your 10K if you're a public

470
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,980
Trading Company is important

471
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,620
now again how important is that to a

472
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,320
sock analyst

473
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,120
day in and day out probably not

474
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,679
important

475
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,539
but if you want to grow into the Future

476
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,340
these are the skills I want you to think

477
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,100
about developing now is all three of

478
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,960
these should be well-rounded

479
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
and

480
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,120
for me I prefer a structured forward now

481
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,880
learning styles is another thing that I

482
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,460
found interesting

483
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,340
so I read I'm an Avid Reader I probably

484
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,260
go through

485
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,039
um

486
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,419
three to five books a month

487
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,679
and one of those will be personal

488
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,419
development one of those right now I'm

489
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,580
reading Atomic habits great book I

490
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,799
recommend it uh one of those will be

491
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,960
professional development

492
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,000
um This Is How They tell me the world

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,260
will end

494
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,120
I got through it

495
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,080
um

496
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,500
and so uh

497
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,559
when I was teaching a class somebody was

498
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,299
talking to me about something they had

499
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,679
learned and I'm like where did you read

500
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
that and they said I watched the History

501
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,700
Channel

502
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,220
and I'm like I need to get over my

503
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,580
prejudiced I'm a dinosaur I believe in

504
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,179
reading books uh there's a group I

505
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,919
belong to for a long time called the

506
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,159
Cyber uh Canon uh that's out there that

507
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,200
that does book reviews and recommends

508
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,299
books to read

509
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,080
I've actually listened to audiobooks now

510
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,620
uh I do you know training on YouTube uh

511
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,559
there's so many ways to train so again

512
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,840
I if you ever thought about this think

513
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,780
about how you learn most effectively

514
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,320
some people have to go physically do it

515
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,500
some people need a lab that's fine

516
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,320
other people can read other people I'm a

517
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,780
little ADD

518
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,000
so my wife is lying I'm not super add

519
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,919
I'm just a little

520
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,419
and so

521
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,640
um You Know audio books are harder for

522
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,900
me

523
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,100
because

524
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,260
I'll I'll realize I haven't heard

525
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,539
anything for the last 20 minutes

526
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:57,059
so it's not a I won't do something

527
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,039
that's important to me on an audiobook

528
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,740
so think about how you learn invest in

529
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,260
that and follow up on that in a

530
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,760
programmatic way

531
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,179
uh anybody want to share ways they learn

532
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,820
that may not be that common or ways that

533
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,159
they really love or

534
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,840
you know

535
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,539
some Channel they love

536
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,600
you

537
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
um

538
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,419
fighting at the most

539
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,020
importation but it's pretty terrible and

540
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,320
I think

541
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,900
so really immersive totally immersive

542
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,960
learning leadership skills and

543
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,059
management skills by

544
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,940
overseeing a volunteer team learning how

545
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,620
to communicate with different people

546
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,140
that are not paying to communicate

547
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,980
because

548
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,080
age

549
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,500
then also you know judges versus Pros

550
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,480
over here definitely a great way to

551
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,039
learn your skills one thing that I

552
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,220
always tell people is if you're here on

553
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,100
your work time or not on your work done

554
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,460
you a ground up at the end of doing this

555
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,799
year what did you learn what did you see

556
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,500
new and then when you go into your next

557
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,080
apartment review you say my main report

558
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,299
that I learned something new by going to

559
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,400
these apartments you may not want me to

560
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,380
have done it but I learned something new

561
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,299
and then you can present because you

562
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,440
learn

563
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,919
yeah I was in training two weeks ago and

564
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,539
I have to take notes when I'm in

565
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,279
training

566
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,960
and I don't know if it's just because

567
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm institutionalized from so much

568
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,240
school but it's important for me to take

569
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,320
notes

570
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,559
because when I write it down it really

571
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,600
makes it go from short-term memory to

572
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
long-term memory for me

573
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,240
I rarely go look at those notes but but

574
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,740
for me

575
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,580
it's it's a meta retention mechanism

576
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,039
other thoughts or or techniques

577
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,799
so you say you you do it real time

578
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,659
you're on the job learning

579
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,840
are you reading are you talking to peers

580
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,158
how are you getting smart

581
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,880
so

582
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,240
yeah

583
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,159
yeah and that's that's an interesting

584
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,720
statement if you really want to learn

585
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
something teach it

586
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,799
uh it's a Quantum shift in and what you

587
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,820
have to synthesize understand to be able

588
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,559
to teach is is huge

589
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,370
whatever

590
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,379
[Music]

591
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,760
and doing the Hands-On I saw also think

592
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,600
is much higher retention

593
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,559
so I studied for my cissp

594
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,860
I took the exam I went to a bar I had a

595
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,120
beer

596
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,000
how much of my retention washed away

597
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,020
with that beer

598
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,159
and so

599
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,679
um yeah I think when you when you do it

600
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,200
in a way that makes a difference or you

601
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,419
teach it or depending on how you studied

602
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,880
you know if you took an exam cram and

603
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,039
took the test yeah

604
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:23,760
95 with that first beer

605
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,820
um

606
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,720
so

607
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,260
how would you go learn about

608
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,899
how your company makes Revenue are you

609
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,240
comfortable going asking your controller

610
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,260
or your CFO

611
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,740
and a lot of them will take on that

612
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,260
mentorship role

613
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,520
um

614
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,860
tons of video out there

615
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,600
and this is almost where you get to

616
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,199
overload

617
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,419
so most if you start to try to

618
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,279
understand Finance are going to be how

619
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,159
to work the stock market or you know how

620
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,440
the treasury Department works

621
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,080
and that's why I like CFO Magazine and

622
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,640
there are some others like that that are

623
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,020
focused on how companies do it

624
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,880
um but yeah you should be able to

625
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,860
understand and if you're in a public

626
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,779
Trading Company it should be fairly easy

627
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,640
because the documentation's out there

628
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,260
what your corporate strategy is again

629
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,539
ciso's love to say oh well my security

630
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,120
is mapped to my corporate strategy oh

631
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,020
great what's your corporate strategy

632
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,820
I it's classified so you know it's worth

633
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,080
learning all these all right

634
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,059
so we talked about coming in

635
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,480
some ways to think about what what makes

636
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,299
sense to pursue when you start

637
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,340
now you're in

638
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,100
and you're building your career

639
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,140
and sooner or later somebody to say hey

640
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,820
you're kicking butt

641
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,279
I want you to be a manager

642
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,039
I want you to take over product

643
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,039
development I want you to do this next

644
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,460
job

645
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,080
and you're going to say great and take

646
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,799
it

647
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,200
and then your career is going to be

648
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,539
managed by opportunities you're not

649
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,760
going to manage your career

650
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,279
and so now what I want to talk about is

651
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,640
thinking about what you want for your

652
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,580
last job the job before you finally

653
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,360
retire

654
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,559
so again I've picked three examples I

655
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,899
you know and again this is it was

656
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,580
interesting we'll talk about a fourth

657
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,020
option here in a minute

658
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,240
don't let me forget

659
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,760
and so there are obviously other

660
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,919
examples but I I came up with three that

661
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,020
I think are fairly representative the

662
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,140
first is you're an entrepreneur

663
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,299
you eventually want to run your own

664
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,399
company

665
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,700
so your skill set is

666
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,919
talking to investors and getting them to

667
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,659
invest in you

668
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,860
hiring people

669
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,539
paying taxes

670
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,679
you know running a company it is not

671
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,640
about being technically competent

672
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,679
now it's much easier to have a

673
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,659
successful company if you have a good

674
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,120
product or something that's in high

675
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,620
demand

676
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,539
But ultimately

677
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,640
that's not a guarantee of having a

678
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,140
successful company

679
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,279
so

680
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,320
if you're an entrepreneur

681
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,240
then the skill sets are suddenly very

682
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,220
different

683
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,880
um

684
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,539
there's a book out Angel Investing

685
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,360
I went and watched a couple videos to

686
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,980
decide if I wanted to read the book

687
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,840
because that's one of my litmus tests

688
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,500
now uh and he's got a couple great ways

689
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,039
that he thinks about who he invests in

690
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,260
and I don't have an entrepreneurial bone

691
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,600
in my body

692
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,419
um and so it was fascinating to me but

693
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,700
not motivating

694
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,299
um but go you know the step one is

695
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:14,039
stepping out there doing it

696
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,519
because on day one you are probably the

697
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,260
CEO the CFO Chief marketer

698
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,019
bottle washer

699
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,080
if you're starting your own business

700
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,139
um

701
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,360
second option

702
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,700
you don't want to run a company you want

703
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,220
to be technical

704
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,380
you don't want to turn into winterfeld

705
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,779
who hasn't touched a computer to do

706
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,539
anything technical in a while

707
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,640
and when my daughter said

708
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,980
could you really hack into my computer I

709
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,860
said well I'll be honest I would

710
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,720
probably need at least 30 days to

711
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,940
rebuild the box and validate that the

712
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,460
tools that I used are still there and

713
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,100
still the right tools I need two or

714
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,500
three months to get competent on the

715
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,320
tools again I need at least a month to

716
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,840
make sure I've built enough you know of

717
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,580
an infrastructure with proxies and

718
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,399
cutouts and tour to cover myself

719
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,519
so I could probably hack your box in six

720
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,419
months

721
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,460
but to be honest I'll just go on the

722
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,140
dark net and hire somebody to do it for

723
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,640
a few thousand dollars and I'll be in

724
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,019
tomorrow if I went in and she's like

725
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,460
okay I believe you

726
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,039
but but I don't have technical skills

727
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,000
anymore

728
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,240
I can have architectural discussions

729
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,279
but I can't sit down on a box and do

730
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,899
anything useful

731
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,240
so I surrendered that now there are

732
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,360
other cisos that have not

733
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,299
so some are trying to keep that balance

734
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,880
and you can do it they are successful

735
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,159
but for me you know

736
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,740
do you want how far away are you going

737
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,419
to step from being technically competent

738
00:32:57,419 --> 00:32:59,580
and if if that's where you're excited to

739
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,080
come to work

740
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,320
then think about being a CTO

741
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,539
and there are variations of this you

742
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,580
know different titles but then I'll come

743
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,100
back to the guy that knows how to make

744
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,620
things work

745
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,500
and they make good money

746
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,559
and it's a respectable position

747
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,980
so this again is a career I and I'm

748
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,200
going to come and I'm going to say hey I

749
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,179
want you to manage a sock team and your

750
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,840
answer should be

751
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,100
I don't know if that's going to make me

752
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,840
a CTO

753
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,299
can I manage the architectural team can

754
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,360
I become the principal architect

755
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,519
does being a sock manager get me to

756
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,899
being a principal architect

757
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
actually do

758
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
stock operations advantage and stock

759
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,159
a little bit better I'm not saying that

760
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,639
you're only going to be getting worse in

761
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,139
you know you're

762
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,800
almost

763
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,339
out together

764
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,619
all of that because as a CTO your

765
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:26,119
profession is available customers

766
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,139
me

767
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,399
okay

768
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,300
so going back to the previous slide

769
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,639
you need to be technically competent you

770
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,619
need to have leadership skills and

771
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,619
revenue skills so a CTO needs to have

772
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,800
leadership skills

773
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,720
if the CTO is in a mssp

774
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,820
then I would agree with you

775
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,280
if the CTO is you know securing uh let's

776
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,920
say the product is data loss prevention

777
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,760
in the cloud

778
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
then then the example is

779
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,660
I don't know that

780
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,760
they would need as much management

781
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,800
skills and an mssp definitely would

782
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm not saying so much

783
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,240
correct

784
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,020
and I could say that he could come in

785
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,900
and build out the infrastructure

786
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,060
and then take over the Architects team

787
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,099
and still be the CTO

788
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,980
and the guy that ran out and so so

789
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,960
I don't want to go too down far down the

790
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,000
rabbit hole but you're right

791
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,140
um

792
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,480
none of these mean you never manage

793
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,579
people being a CTO

794
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,020
um

795
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,180
how many people know if their CTO

796
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,920
manages people raise your hand if your

797
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,560
CTO does manage people

798
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,500
and you're if they do not

799
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,320
so more ctOS in than not our running

800
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,020
teams today

801
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,339
um and then the last is being a ciso

802
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,320
and here I would say you're probably

803
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,700
having

804
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,980
more business skills

805
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,240
uh more leadership skills than

806
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,760
anything else you've got to be able to

807
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,280
lead in a crisis you've got to be able

808
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,160
to convince people that your strategy is

809
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,599
correct and they should fund your

810
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,700
strategy

811
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,319
you have to be able to talk to a board

812
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,680
um

813
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,859
talking to board is a unique experience

814
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,359
uh

815
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,339
it and boards are becoming more and more

816
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,780
technically competent because more and

817
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,579
more companies

818
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:11,160
have a portion of their right up in the

819
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,380
res tied directly to their technology

820
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,240
capabilities

821
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,400
and because of that you're seeing that

822
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,920
more and more have you seen the recent

823
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,680
SEC requirement to have a somebody with

824
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,960
computer security requirements on a

825
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,280
board

826
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,800
so it's also becoming a regulatory

827
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,339
requirement

828
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,220
um so as a ciso

829
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,200
one of the skills you should be

830
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,780
developing is to become a board member

831
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,280
because you're going to go talk to the

832
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,240
board

833
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,339
so there are courses in how to be a

834
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,640
director

835
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,260
so we're seeing more and more people and

836
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,700
I don't know that you need to go be

837
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,640
certified in this uh

838
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
this is one I've heard mixed reviews on

839
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,500
whether or not you can go volunteer

840
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,040
and be on a board of a non-profit and

841
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,119
get credit for the same skills needed to

842
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,740
be on a

843
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,400
you know for-profit board uh I tend to

844
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,619
think that the skills should be somewhat

845
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,260
transferable but a lot of that is uh

846
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,599
I've seen a lot of debates on how

847
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,260
transferable that uh is today

848
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,980
so again

849
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,940
eight to ten years in the career field

850
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,000
building out some secure architecture

851
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
bringing things to Market

852
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,240
that I've shown success

853
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,839
so

854
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,260
uh like what's the youngest

855
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,380
chapter in the field

856
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,440
virtual

857
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,920
so the question is

858
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,940
um

859
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,400
when do you see someone being ready to

860
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,960
be a CSO and what do you think of the

861
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,839
virtual CEO CSO and what do you think of

862
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,520
the virtual CSO

863
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,640
um

864
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,400
you know if you're a startup

865
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,660
um

866
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,160
the

867
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
the qualifications are a lot lower

868
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,859
and everybody there is accepting higher

869
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,140
levels of risk

870
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,740
um

871
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,579
typically once a company makes it around

872
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,980
10 to 50 million

873
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,040
in Revenue they start going away from

874
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,440
the startup culture to a process driven

875
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,579
culture

876
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,140
because you have to

877
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,720
when you start getting not everybody

878
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,960
knows Sally runs travel

879
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,819
you know you need a process to run

880
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:17,000
travel not a person

881
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,619
and then when you get up towards the

882
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,579
fortune 5000 Fortune 500

883
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:24,200
um

884
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,240
then there's real

885
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
uh

886
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,280
financial responsibility and experience

887
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,160
and it goes along with it

888
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,880
so you know I don't have a problem with

889
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,880
people coming out of college and taking

890
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,940
a role as a startup

891
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,460
because everybody there kind of knows

892
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,619
how much risk is being

893
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,060
does that is that a fair answer

894
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,000
it takes longer to become a CSO

895
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,119
well

896
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
I don't think

897
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,599
CTO and ciso are the Catch-22 positions

898
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,800
it's hard to get it until you've had one

899
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,980
um and and yeah that's why you see uh

900
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,720
people have taken a step back in their

901
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,900
career to get a title

902
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,880
to move forward in the long run

903
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,339
and all those rules are in constant flux

904
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,839
I have no advice on whether or not

905
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,000
that's a smart move the second question

906
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,700
was around the virtual ciso

907
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,660
um

908
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,119
so I feel really bad about this uh I

909
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,440
don't know if any of you listened to

910
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,700
cyber wire

911
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,180
uh but Rick Howard on cyberwire and I

912
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,780
were talking to RSA and I was talking

913
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,319
about the virtual CSO and he goes yeah

914
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,880
we should talk about that on one of my

915
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,800
shows and we both kind of agreed on our

916
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,200
stance and before I got on the show I

917
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,599
did some research in

918
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,000
um there are virtual CFOs

919
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,020
there are virtual CEOs

920
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,960
and the thought process is

921
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,380
I am going to I have a startup company

922
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,680
I don't want to be my own CEO because

923
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,880
Winterfell said all those things that I

924
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,079
don't want to do I don't want to do

925
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,480
marketing I don't want to do hiring

926
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,000
people I want to be like the chief

927
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,180
technical officer that's also the CEO

928
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,579
so I get a virtual one

929
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,240
I was shocked to see that there was a

930
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,800
virtual CFO

931
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,300
because

932
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,819
how many times have you seen people say

933
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,099
what skill does the ciso need do they

934
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,760
need an MBA or a technical degree that's

935
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,619
been a big debate lately

936
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,960
you've never heard anybody say should a

937
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,619
CFO have a financial background

938
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,160
and that's always kind of irritated me

939
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,520
and the reason is so many cisos go up to

940
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,440
the board as technical advisors

941
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,020
not business advisors they go up and

942
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,440
talk about technology and risk not about

943
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,119
the business

944
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,220
and because of that

945
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,980
the board wants people that are

946
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,780
interested in making the business better

947
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,060
and they want cisos that will talk about

948
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,280
business how to be a better partner how

949
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,359
to move the company forward

950
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,440
very awesome

951
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,900
Powerball through our industry that I

952
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,400
think

953
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,260
requirements actually be technical

954
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,980
security experience

955
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,160
so if you didn't hear the end that was a

956
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,339
statement that said CFOs being

957
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:26,040
financially competent is a recent

958
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,800
development in 2004 the regulations

959
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,160
started driving that

960
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,960
and we may see something similar in

961
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,660
cyber security where it's going to drive

962
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,079
back to competence in the field rather

963
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,260
than just good leadership skills and the

964
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,060
ability to be uh

965
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,259
a business partner

966
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,160
um

967
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,660
so again the virtual ciso question

968
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,220
um

969
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,160
because so I think there is a role for

970
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,980
the virtual cisl but I think there's an

971
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,740
incredible amount of danger

972
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,420
because if I have a virtual ciso for my

973
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,920
startup

974
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,960
at what point do I need to hire a

975
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,160
full-time ciso

976
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,000
does a 50 million dollar company need a

977
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,859
full-time ciso

978
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:26,119
if they're in manufacturing and have low

979
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,619
intellectual property do they need a

980
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,300
full-time cisf

981
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,920
and so

982
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,180
um

983
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,839
I think there's a slippery slope here

984
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:38,640
um I don't think it's necessarily A Bad

985
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,140
Thing

986
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,119
I just don't know where that slippery

987
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,339
slope uh starts to gain traction

988
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,900
certifications

989
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
um

990
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,680
say again

991
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,300
thank you

992
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,640
oh um the fourth one thank you good

993
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,119
catch uh I was mentoring somebody and I

994
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,740
was going through my stick

995
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,700
and he says well what if my final job is

996
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,899
to be a husband and a father

997
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,040
well

998
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,040
that was an excellent question and so it

999
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,319
goes back to the balance

1000
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:22,260
a lot of these jobs up here aren't

1001
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,520
designed for balance

1002
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,640
um and so uh

1003
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,380
I would just encourage you to think

1004
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,319
about that as you decide what you want

1005
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:38,880
to do and you know I've got a nephew who

1006
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,300
truly right now works to pay for his

1007
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,780
free time

1008
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,619
so

1009
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:48,900
you know that's that's a great life and

1010
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,540
I don't have any objections to that

1011
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,319
uh

1012
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,400
hahaha

1013
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,140
I mean you'll have great vacations right

1014
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,098
but it's absolutely

1015
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,319
and the statement was balance and timing

1016
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,920
uh and so you may want to think about

1017
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,559
when you hit where I am which is an

1018
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:52,440
empty nester which is awesome

1019
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,079
um then you know maybe you can put more

1020
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,619
time into work uh I've had so many High

1021
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,480
Travel jobs it was interesting you know

1022
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,280
my wife and I used to joke that when I

1023
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,220
retired she was gonna have to come up

1024
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,440
ways for me to to stay out of the house

1025
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,140
enough to keep our relationship sane

1026
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,359
and fortunately after the lockdown we

1027
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,160
discovered we still like each other so

1028
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,079
retirement's going to work out but yeah

1029
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,480
that that life balance is incredibly

1030
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,859
important

1031
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,079
certifications

1032
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,800
um so basically

1033
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,900
they'll get you through the HR gate

1034
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,480
that's all certifications are for in my

1035
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,319
opinion

1036
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,839
if Auditors love them

1037
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,780
I have my sock go through an internal

1038
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,720
certification program because Auditors

1039
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,940
now say oh well they're certified

1040
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,920
they're good

1041
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,240
so yeah certifications are an HR gate

1042
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:48,960
um

1043
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,540
if you're interested in a job

1044
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,000
spend some time on LinkedIn and see what

1045
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,099
certifications are required for the

1046
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,500
field you want to go into

1047
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,900
and then you know

1048
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,000
um

1049
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,400
so

1050
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,020
if you're going to go look for a job

1051
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,640

um

1066
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,540
LinkedIn and your resume should look the

1067
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,880
same and they should only talk about the

1068
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,780
impacts you've had

1069
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,680
that's what I'm looking for what did you

1070
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,059
accomplish what did you do I don't care

00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:52,619
about your job titles or your duties

go in decide on your budget

1075

decide on whether or not you're willing

1076
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,339
to move decide how important a title is

1077
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,680
before you start

1078
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,599
those are discussions to have with your

1079
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,520
family

1080
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,599
um

1081
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,880
practice interviewing

1082
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,660
uh nobody here would go try to run a

1083
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,980
marathon tomorrow

1084
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,000

1085
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,500
practice negotiation practice

1086

interviewing

1087

I've been interviewing a lot of people

1088
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,319
I forgot when I went to go interview

1089
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,099
they're different muscles

1090
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,059
so I had to go get back in shape to

1091
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:38,460
actually do an interview and the last

1092
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,380
and most important thing

1093
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,680
have an emotional support system

1094
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,260

1095

1096
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,980
make sure you have a buddy or somebody

1097
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,059
