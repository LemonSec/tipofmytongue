we are we talked about everything's on

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
fire yesterday or things were flammable

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
and stuff's on fire

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
so let's have a fireside chat with some

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
of our favorite journalists

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,600
um

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,080
there are a lot more puns in our wedding

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
dolls than there will be on stage today

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
but um

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
so

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,720
a couple things just to frame the day

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
and then we'll get to uh introductions

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
for our panelists or our fireside

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,159
chatters

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
is yesterday was really about we started

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,600
the cavalry nine years ago we wanted to

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,759
tell people stuff was flammable that our

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
dependence on

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,720
software and technology and critical

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
infrastructure was growing faster than

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
our ability to secure it we were worried

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,200
about where bits and bytes beat flesh

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
and blood but we knew and we told the

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
room that no one would really listen

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
until there was proof of harm until we

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,079
had existence groups and feel people are

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,360
actually hacking these it's one thing to

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
do stunt hacking of a car or a medical

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
device it's another when it manifests

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,399
harm and could represent

58
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,240
a crisis of confidence in the public to

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
trust these connected technologies and

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
we don't want that so while any loss of

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
life would be tragic

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,160
we realized the failure mode was not

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
merely a loss of life but any sort of

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
crisis of confidence for people to trust

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,000
otherwise superior medicine

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,599
driverless vehicles

67
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,959
that the light switch would turn the

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
lights on or that the water was

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,840
drinkable

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,160
and in the last two years

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239
in in parallel with the global pandemic

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
we saw successful attacks of the water

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
we drink the food we put on our table

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
the oil and gas that fuel our cars our

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
homes and our supply chains the schools

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,920
our kids attend

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
the municipalities who run our towns our

78
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
cities are

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
functioning of government

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
and even timely access to patient care

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
with uh

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,239
mortal consequences as we saw with

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,080
kendra's talk yesterday about the sisiko

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
task force findings so we have seen that

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
delays affect patient outcomes and loss

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
of life and protracted cyber attacks

87
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
introduced delays sufficient to drive

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
those outcomes

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,879
so i think one of the head scratchers

90
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
for us in the cavalry was now that

91
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
people can see on john oliver on hbo or

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
on you know it's main street news that

93
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
you couldn't get gas so there have been

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
disruptions and there's been hacks

95
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,200
we really thought there'd be more

96
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
political will and more advanced

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
conversations about what to do about it

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,519
and now we're asking between yesterday

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,879
and today is how should the mission of

100
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
the capillary change and evolve

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
now that we're not telling people and

102
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
educating that things are flammable but

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
now

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
hopefully trying to drive down and

105
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,680
minimize risk a little bit more fire

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,080
fighting or engaging those underserved

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
by either the private sector or the

108
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,879
public sector

109
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
and we lovingly call that the cyber poor

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,120
so what i really wanted to do is we've

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,799
always loved working with our press and

112
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,080
it's always been a difficult thing to

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,920
talk about future risks and slow moving

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
risks if you saw the movie don't look up

115
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
today's opening session is to say

116
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
how did the world look nine years ago

117
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
before there was proof of harm and how

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,159
does it look now that we are having main

119
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
street mainstream kitchen conversations

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
to quote bryson from yesterday about

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,200
cyber attacks affecting

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,760
food water shelter safety

123
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,599
and maybe learn from some of the

124
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,879
journalists that have been on this ride

125
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
for a while

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
how this room and this community should

127
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
think differently about pitching stories

128
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
making ourselves available focusing on

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
the public good instead of the private

130
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,600
enterprise good focusing on public

131
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
safety human life instead of record

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,560
count

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
and

134
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
we don't have good answers to this but

135
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
i've started some conversations with

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
lily and joe

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,040
and i will let them introduce themselves

138
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
so we can get into some content and

139
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
there are microphones and if you do ask

140
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,840
a question i'll either have to repeat it

141
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
for the streaming because people are

142
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
watching from their rooms and from the

143
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,400
intertubes

144
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,240
or just go up to the mic and uh you'll

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
be heard yourself but uh let's get

146
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
started on the meet the press would you

147
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
like to introduce yourself lilly

148
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
hi hi everyone i am lilly hayne newman

149
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
i'm a senior writer at wired and i've

150
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
been on information security

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
cyber security digital privacy beat for

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
six years and i was a general interest

153
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,600
tech reporter before that so uh

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
going back to

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
the start of the cavalry uh i

156
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
was

157
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
definitely writing about adjacent stuff

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
uh so it's yeah i'm happy to be here and

159
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
it's it's really interesting to think

160
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
back to that time

161
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
and sort of reflect on where we are now

162
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
i think we don't always

163
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,039
have a moment for that type of

164
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
reflection and i think it's really

165
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,800
productive

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
um my name is joe youtube um i am let's

167
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,719
get a little closer

168
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
sorry about that my name is joe youtube

169
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
and you can hear me now

170
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
uh i am a reporter for sc

171
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
media um which is a business to business

172
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
cyber security publication before that i

173
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
was at axios and started the code book

174
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
newsletter

175
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,080
which i think they're about to bring

176
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
back so

177
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,880
hooray

178
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
um i've been covering

179
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,319
cyber security as

180
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
um like as an ex

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
exclusively covering it since

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,800
just before sony so what's up

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
2014

184
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,960
2013 2015. it's weird that i can

185
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
get the

186
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
i now date things

187
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,560
by news stories um

188
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
but yeah since around then um

189
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
it has changed a lot uh i think

190
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
back

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
in uh

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
when i was starting out i could not show

193
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
up to the office and nobody would know

194
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
and now now it now it would be a thing

195
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,520
if the cyber person wasn't that

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
yeah during our prep i was trying to say

197
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
so i guess this is a good a good place

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,280
to go which is um

199
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,039
if we try to do a deliberate compare and

200
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,240
contrast between 2013 uh

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,360
and now

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,039
um one of the things i pointed out is we

203
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
had just had the snowden revelations and

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
there was

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,280
probably the worst levels of

206
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
trust between hackers and government

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,120
that we were going to see for a while

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,599
and quite a few white hat hackers or

209
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
helpful hackers were pretty angry and

210
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
looking at

211
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
maybe uh

212
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,479
going a little gray or a little charcoal

213
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
colored in their hats and

214
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
people were upset and it was really

215
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,840
difficult to say let's try to be a

216
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
helping hand to

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,280
drive safer outcomes with government

218
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
partnerships but we also were pretty

219
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,960
worried about that

220
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
we'd seen some medical device hacking

221
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
from barnaby jack in fact he tragically

222
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
lost his life just before we launched in

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
fact he was supposed to be in the room

224
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
with us

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,440
we uh saw some car early car hacking but

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
it was considered theoretical or it's

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,199
not hacking at times um

228
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,879
and one of the things we told the room

229
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,560
was people would have to die first

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
before they're really going to listen to

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
us and then somebody shouted out why do

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
this then and i said well we want to be

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,479
have a head start and build the trust

234
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,680
and lay the groundwork and the

235
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
scaffolding so that they turn to us

236
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
instead of lesser people with lesser

237
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
motives and lesser ideas so that we

238
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
don't have an overreaction like a cyber

239
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
patriot act or something

240
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
but the whole goal here was to maintain

241
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
the trust of the public so if you

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,720
situate yourself in post-snowden

243
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
revelations anger and distrust between

244
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,479
government

245
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,520
no fda regulations

246
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
and what did coverage look like um

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
and now just free of pre-associate i

248
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
guess well i was just thinking we were

249
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
talking about data you know dating the

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
passage of time with news stories and it

251
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,279
that era was really like a data era i

252
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,440
feel like where like data can be

253
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
accessed or it exists in tropes like

254
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
that was the big concept because i'm

255
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,519
thinking about i think it was early 2014

256
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,720
like maybe

257
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
february or march that the target

258
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
breach was revealed and like neiman

259
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
marcus and i don't know this is feeling

260
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,440
very retro in my mind i'm like wow we're

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
back in this era but um

262
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
i feel like that was those were some of

263
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
the big mainstream discussions that year

264
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
along with you know what you're saying

265
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
about the snowden revelations so it's

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
sort of like a

267
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
you know

268
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,399
bulk

269
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,880
surveillance collection

270
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
corporate data troves

271
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
what if people were to access this data

272
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
like moment or that that was like where

273
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
people were at

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
in sort of the mainstream in terms of

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
what the press i think

276
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,279
was trying to convey to the mainstream

277
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,959
audience

278
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,760
um

279
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
i

280
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
sorry i almost did the same thing again

281
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,120
um

282
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
it's strange like a lot of the result

283
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
i don't think we quite knew what we were

284
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
covering yet because so many of the

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,600
threats hadn't materialized so a lot of

286
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
things were very speculative

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
but

288
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,279
crime was

289
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
since it was crime was

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
as as always

291
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,120
mostly

292
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
data breaches

293
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
and the the nation-state

294
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,839
kind of level

295
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,880
was still very

296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
very driven by um

297
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
it was still very uncertain like we

298
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
people didn't understand how attribution

299
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
was going to work there was the north

300
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
korea

301
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,320
thing where

302
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,800
people sort of sort of reject it

303
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
um i think since then we've seen

304
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,040
sort of the rise of news covering um

305
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
every breach and making that the big

306
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
event like a breach by breach by breach

307
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
and that being the big news story of the

308
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
day and not really taking a broader look

309
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,279
at it

310
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
um

311
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,519
i think that's sort of dying down but

312
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
only because they've been concentrating

313
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
on single breaches longer but it seems

314
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
to be

315
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
very event-driven now um

316
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,160
whereas in the past it was more

317
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
speculative if that makes sense

318
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,839
yeah and i'm also thinking about like we

319
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
used to cover i don't know even thinking

320
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
you know i always

321
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
and i'm sure you the same way like we

322
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,560
were always trying to

323
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
uh

324
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
have the most context possible and do

325
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,480
smart journalism like joe and i are both

326
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
trying to like do good reporting and not

327
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,320
just go breach to breach or something

328
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
but it feels quaint to think back to

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,680
some of the coverage like you know even

330
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
five years ago or something

331
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
stories that wired readers were super

332
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,120
super interested in like massive traffic

333
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,519
which not for its own sake but in terms

334
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
of who was reading like the number of

335
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,959
people who were reading

336
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,240
uh i'm thinking about like stories about

337
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
what's the biggest

338
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,959
volumetric ddos attack that's ever

339
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,959
happened it would be like now github was

340
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,720
hit with the biggest one now this was

341
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,160
hit with the biggest one or cloudflare

342
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
whatever and like people were very

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,880
interested in reading those stories and

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
it would cause you know maybe outages

345
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,480
for a few minutes or an hour or like the

346
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
company wanted to talk about it because

347
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,079
they didn't have any downtime at all or

348
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,800
like whatever but it you know

349
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
it's just to say that that was where we

350
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
were at in terms of the collective

351
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
conversation of cyber attacks and

352
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,480
impacts

353
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
one thing that we don't get to write

354
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
anymore and it's for the better

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
around 2016

356
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
and for for obvious reasons there was

357
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
the rise of the

358
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
um

359
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
that wasn't hacked news story

360
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
like where there would be a power outage

361
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,079
and you'd have to write a new story

362
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,040
about how

363
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
that wasn't hacked or apt

364
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,480
um i think people are

365
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,810
a little bit more

366
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,480
[Music]

367
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
a little bit less on edge

368
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,639
that

369
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
anything could be

370
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,800
any anything that went wrong could be

371
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
hacked well i mean it isn't really

372
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
anything that can be wrong for that it

373
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,040
was really all power grid um and i think

374
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,920
that's uh so

375
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
but yeah sorry

376
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
yeah it's it's hard for me to even ask

377
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,079
these questions because i've always been

378
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
on the i care less about my

379
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
credit card and more about my access to

380
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
patient care you know we've been here

381
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,040
for nine years we've been trying to get

382
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,760
the world to catch up a bit but you know

383
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
i would say that as you think of how we

384
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
used to characterize stories it was

385
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
record count or dollar amount was the

386
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,519
unit of impact

387
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
and now it's

388
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,720
potentially quality of patient care

389
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
or how long are you without oil and gas

390
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,240
or

391
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
how long can a municipality not function

392
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,560
and perform the duties it needs to to

393
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
keep its citizens safe and

394
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,639
you know one of the supply chain

395
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
cascading impacts of a meat packing

396
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
facility getting hacked or cream cheese

397
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
my daughters were about to riot because

398
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
they couldn't have cream cheese for

399
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
their bagels for a while and people

400
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,120
didn't know why and part of why was

401
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,399
there was a hack

402
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,600
of one of our

403
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
concentrated uh

404
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
developers of cream cheese um

405
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
exacerbated by trucker shortages

406
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,079
exacerbated by

407
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
other covent factories but the net

408
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,920
outcome here is if there's not enough

409
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,839
slack in the system

410
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
you know even these seemingly

411
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
unimportant ransoms of a single entity

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,240
could have cascading rippling effects on

413
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,519
you know if my kids are going to riot

414
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
for cream cheese so i care a little bit

415
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,880
less about cream cheese and more about

416
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
losses of life

417
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
but

418
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it is often difficult and this group has

419
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
found it difficult to

420
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
get these stories told that are about

421
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
the public good instead of a specific

422
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
victim

423
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
so we're all ears for advice on how

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
editors are shifting focus or what

425
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,600
stories have a chance and which ones

426
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
don't you know

427
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,440
how we might

428
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
both respond in organic changes but also

429
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
try to affect maybe some deliberate

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,839
changes so that we can ensure there's

431
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,600
not always

432
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,760
and i can't i still find people who say

433
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
well yeah josh people might have died

434
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
but what about the record count like

435
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
there's just a really palpable part of

436
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
us that is painful yeah

437
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,399
i think

438
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,920
there's a belief that and it may it

439
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,440
might bear out in in traffic numbers but

440
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
there's a belief that

441
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,480
if unless it's

442
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
kind of

443
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,800
unless it's unless there's an enterprise

444
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,920
angle

445
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,720
unless you're talking about um

446
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
you're talking to businesses it's tough

447
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
to sell advertising uh um

448
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,519
at least that was the sense i got at

449
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,880
axios

450
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
um

451
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,959
where uh

452
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,279
they wanted it to be more

453
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
more either about controversies from big

454
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
tech brands or um

455
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,839
more about businesses

456
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,040
or know

457
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
i i hope that's changing um i i've been

458
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
at a been at something that solely

459
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
covers the enterprise for the past two

460
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
years but uh

461
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
i think that there's

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,320
as people have seen

463
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,959
real-time chaos engineering

464
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,920
um

465
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
you know the power outages in texas or

466
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
like you were mentioned colonial

467
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
pipeline people have a better sense of

468
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,720
what can go wrong but i think it's one

469
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
at a time yeah

470
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,519
i don't know if there's

471
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,160
i think that people are very driven by

472
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
stories like not not necessarily

473
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,920
um

474
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,199
people like a narrative rather than a

475
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,240
fact and that's it's easier to tell a

476
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
narrative about

477
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
people lining up for you know lining up

478
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,040
for gas to put in their trash bags

479
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,480
than it is to say um

480
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,000
to cover the you know the effect of

481
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
copyright law on uh

482
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,290
on on

483
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,760
[Music]

484
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,839
hacking

485
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,480
hardware well and yeah i i want to add

486
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,240
like we should talk a little bit josh

487
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,079
about what we've been discussing about

488
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,240
the interdisciplinary nature of some of

489
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,559
these stories because i just want to say

490
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,799
first that you know i think what we were

491
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,440
saying about what you said about it used

492
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,039
to be i could take a day off and no one

493
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,039
even noticed and now it's like where is

494
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,640
the person who needs to write about this

495
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
every single day like i've that is a

496
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
real thing and that's a real issue with

497
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
getting stories written and getting them

498
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
to break through is that there's just so

499
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,240
much going on i mean it used to be

500
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
when i would come to black and defcon

501
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,440
and

502
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
and b-sides and cover talks at all the

503
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
conferences

504
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
like

505
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
there was nothing else i needed to be

506
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,880
doing that week but that right like that

507
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
that was the you know news that really

508
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
needed to get out there that week and

509
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
now it's like 30 other things are

510
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
happening this week and i'm like

511
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
like what you know my editors and i are

512
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,039
like what do we do because you know

513
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:15,919
so

514
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,559
anyway i think and so especially you

515
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,720
know to transition to you know what we

516
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
had been talking about like

517
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,280
stories and what you're saying about

518
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,919
narratives and real human stories that

519
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,600
are the most important stories that we

520
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
all really want to be telling that are

521
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
the most impactful

522
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
those stories take a lot more time a lot

523
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
more sensitivity and

524
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
and various types of expertise

525
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,559
and

526
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
it's just a very

527
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
there's like a lot of cooks in this

528
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
kitchen you know

529
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
i think one thing that's worth noting um

530
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,880
and this is for the better um

531
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
more people who write about cyber

532
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
security are focused on cyber security

533
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,679
now than there were um

534
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,240
at any other time in history

535
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
it's a fun thing to be able to say um i

536
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,679
think that

537
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,760
if you remember

538
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
uh norse

539
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,799
um

540
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,360
with the aei report that uh

541
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
um

542
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
speculated that iran was

543
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
hacking the united states

544
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
hundreds of thousands of times a day it

545
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,799
just turned out it was you know

546
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,679
background noise and ppu

547
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
um

548
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,960
that can happen those kinds of stories

549
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
can happen the uh

550
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
the

551
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,120
the

552
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
power grid story in the washington post

553
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,039
i think that that was

554
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
the vermont was that

555
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
there was a there was a time that they

556
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,080
had said that some did have the power

557
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,080
grid that turned out to be

558
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,960
the ms blaster from 2013 that one no i

559
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
think it was around 20 well

560
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
yeah the fact that there's more than one

561
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
example point um

562
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
a lot of those things slip through

563
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
because the people who ended up covering

564
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
cyber security stories

565
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
were people who had no infosec

566
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,760
background and can be easily swayed by

567
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
the um

568
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,760
by things that sounded very impressive

569
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
um but not but didn't really have a

570
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
sense of how to evaluate whether or not

571
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320
they were true

572
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
wow there's so much i want to unpack

573
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,440
from this i'm just going to scatter shot

574
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
a few things i heard that we could play

575
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,360
it on us

576
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,799
choose your own adventure because any

577
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,000
one of these could turn into an hour

578
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
conversation

579
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,080
one of the things that surprised me um

580
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
i'll just enumerate them uh not

581
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
prioritized one of the things that

582
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,960
surprised me is i've actually seen a

583
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,159
thinning out

584
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
of journalists um a lot of

585
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
really good journalists and really good

586
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
beats have gone away and now some of

587
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,360
those excellent journalists are in

588
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
sponsored corporate journalism they're

589
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,799
still doing good stories but there's

590
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,000
always that risk that there's an

591
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,640
editorial slant towards that market or

592
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
that product set

593
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
and i still love and respect these

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
journalists and it's it's sad to me to

595
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
see so many of them not working for a

596
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
news outlet or independent news outlet

597
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
but doing news under the inframater of

598
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,200
some corporate entity

599
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,240
so

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
number two um a bunch of us are

601
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
observing there's stunningly few

602
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
journalists here in vegas this week and

603
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,840
it's possibly kova it's possibly

604
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,440
competing stories it's possibly that

605
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
this isn't sexy anymore

606
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
um but that is an observation i think

607
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,919
worth noting i'm very glad you're both

608
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,039
here

609
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,240
um

610
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
number three um

611
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,360
i

612
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
worry

613
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
um

614
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
about where lily was going we talked

615
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
about this in advance

616
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,760
some of the stories that came out of our

617
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,280
 code task force were so

618
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
multi-disciplinary in nature you

619
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,039
couldn't find a single journalist with a

620
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,200
single beat that felt comfortable doing

621
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,360
it and unless there was

622
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,919
capacity in their medical

623
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,840
companion or their government oversight

624
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,039
companion

625
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
these stories couldn't get told so there

626
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
was a level of complexity

627
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,480
that

628
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,799
created enough hesitation for the harder

629
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,600
the

630
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,480
the more substantive stories to get told

631
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,320
so pick apart any of these are none of

632
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
these but

633
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,159
i have some concern over this

634
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,640
i i guess working backwards um it's easy

635
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
it's easy for me to say uh

636
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,200
lily should do it but um

637
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,440
the uh i think i'll take all your scoops

638
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,039
too

639
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,440
the d i think that there you with uh

640
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,600
things that are extremely

641
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,320
multi-disciplinary you might have better

642
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,559
luck with magazines where they have time

643
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,320
to do

644
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
thought out coverage uh compared to

645
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
newspapers where we're expected to

646
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,039
increasingly put out a story not only

647
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
every day but every

648
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,600
few hours

649
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
when i was at the hell um i was at the

650
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
hill but also i didn't say that in my

651
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,679
bio um but the expectation was four or

652
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,320
five stories a day wow um

653
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
and by the time i was leaving they were

654
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
trying to figure out which four or five

655
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
stories a day and i remember they were

656
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,880
really excited about a lacrosse team

657
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
that was hacked because i thought that

658
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
would be very popular it did not turn

659
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,480
out to be very popular

660
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
um

661
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
but uh

662
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,320
at least i got to learn that there was a

663
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
professional lacrosse league so that's

664
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
that's something but

665
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,720
in terms of the uh

666
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
the five story a day model isn't great

667
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
for things that we have to learn outside

668
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,000
uh learn something new um

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,919
one story a day isn't great for that but

670
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,200
it's possible um or

671
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
but the people who have time to really

672
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,679
write things out

673
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,840
uh probably have the best chance of

674
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
understanding something that covers more

675
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,200
than one thing

676
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
but i think you really hit on it because

677
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
the thing is

678
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
i think the jbs

679
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,400
uh meet

680
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,320
you know ransomware attack supply chain

681
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
attack uh is

682
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,960
a great example because it's like

683
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
to use the example of wired

684
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
the thing we don't have at wired

685
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,360
is

686
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,520
someone who's sourced up on the meat

687
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,480
supply chain right right like who does

688
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,279
or who does like meat futures or like we

689
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,880
have no meat coverage guys

690
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
so

691
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
i i think this really raises a good

692
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,279
point that some of the blind spot or

693
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,960
some of the

694
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,080
like

695
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,559
you know best intentions where stories

696
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
don't end up happening that josh you're

697
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
saying like how do we get these stories

698
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,440
to happen

699
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
comes from the fact that certain

700
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
publications

701
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,039
potentially have the like institutional

702
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
expertise if you put multiple people

703
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,760
together but there's the pres those are

704
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,000
newspapers and like wire services and

705
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
stuff that have their own

706
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
pressures right like

707
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
reuters for example they do amazing

708
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,720
cyber security coverage um

709
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,559
they they were an organization that i

710
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
was like okay they're more likely to

711
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,679
have

712
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,400
solid stuff on jvs i'm just using this

713
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,039
as an example because

714
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,799
they've got cyber security reporters

715
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,600
they've got you know meet people they've

716
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,960
got you know all the different like um

717
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
whatever import like you know reporting

718
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
expertise or import export all the

719
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,120
different things you'd need but they

720
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
don't have time right they only do a

721
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
certain type of story like the the the

722
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,200
sort of 200 word or 400 word reuters uh

723
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,039
and i mean occasionally amazing long

724
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,960
investigations whatever but just to use

725
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,600
this example whereas wired can go really

726
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,840
deep on something but

727
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,600
can only put one or maybe two reporters

728
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,840
on like a deep investigation

729
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,279
uh so

730
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,400
yeah i think that's really getting to

731
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
there's an interesting thing that goes

732
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
along with that um kim zetter once made

733
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,559
the point and uh

734
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,159
that um

735
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,440
one of the nice

736
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,799
one of the ways you could tell it was

737
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,880
going to be a good news story is if one

738
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
of the names in the byline was the the

739
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
research

740
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
person you know the person who

741
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
um

742
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
many newspapers have a not just an

743
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,840
archivist but somebody who's in charge

744
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,760
of sort of be doing background and

745
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,240
research fact checking and things like

746
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,919
that that sometimes will get their name

747
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,400
in print um as part of a story

748
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,279
and that

749
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,840
creates a great sense of institutional

750
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
knowledge and i don't think that

751
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,440
cyber security really has that a lot of

752
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,360
the reporters are young

753
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,320
um

754
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,240
and i think that that sort of gets some

755
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,279
one of the other things you're saying a

756
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,760
lot of the reporters going to

757
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,840
either either becoming a lot of the

758
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,799
older reporters moving towards um public

759
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
relations or um

760
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,880
the

761
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
you know things like the record which i

762
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,919
say that they are independent so uh just

763
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,279
to be fair to

764
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,919
right um um

765
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,039
there are

766
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
great farm systems now uh i think cyber

767
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,600
scoop

768
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
has created a bunch of really good

769
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,200
reporters

770
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,360
um chris ping came from there um

771
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,200
a few other

772
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,240
and we were supposed to have a

773
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,840
cyberscooper on this panel right

774
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,200
make the flights for that one yeah

775
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,799
suzanne's had some great initial stories

776
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,559
shannon you know like a bunch of really

777
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,600
good people have come from that and

778
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
one of the things that's really

779
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,039
difficult in journalism is finding

780
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,559
somewhere that will train you to do

781
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,159
something well

782
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,120
and so um

783
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,159
while

784
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,919
some of the more venerable people may be

785
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,360
doing

786
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,679
more things that seem

787
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,840
that seem distasteful i think that

788
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
there's a group of people

789
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,960
there are more people who exist who

790
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,039
might be able to

791
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,360
okay to handle them

792
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,120
and um

793
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
it's hard to jump off my own shadow when

794
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,720
i ask this it's a bit of a loaded

795
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,960
question but as somebody who i think has

796
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,919
kind of

797
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,080
rallied the public interest public good

798
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
public safety

799
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,679
subset of the hacker community

800
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,320
we often cringe when we see people we

801
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
like and respect for their enterprise

802
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
perspective or their corporate

803
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,360
for-profit perspective being quoted

804
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,840
on public safety stories when the

805
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
message is optimized for private

806
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
interest instead of public interest and

807
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,480
i think some of it i've seen is just

808
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,799
people get used to you know reliable

809
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,480
sources or people that are quote worthy

810
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
or might get more clicks because their

811
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,640
name but they may exactly be the wrong

812
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,159
person to ask like we'll see something

813
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,360
where there's

814
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,679
collectively 100 years of experience in

815
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,880
the room

816
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
and somebody who spent no time on that

817
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,440
topic is the lead quote um and you know

818
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
i know that that's some journalism 101

819
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,679
stuff but is there a need or an

820
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,919
opportunity to differentiate between

821
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,159
corporate security and consequential

822
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,799
security or private interest security

823
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,960
and public good

824
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
could there be a discipline where it's

825
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,559
easier for any journalist to find

826
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
sources in category a versus b or am i

827
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,200
just butchering my articulation here i

828
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
think lily might have a better sense of

829
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
it than me uh because your beat is more

830
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,640
business to business right he's more

831
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,480
business to business um

832
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,480
but i think that that's the fact that

833
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,320
there are publications that are business

834
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
to business and not publications that

835
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,399
are public to public right um sort of

836
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,159
says something that uh

837
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,640
the uh

838
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,320
people are interested in the enterprise

839
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
point of view because many of the

840
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,640
readers of these stories are in fact

841
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,039
enterprises uh and want to know what

842
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,480
they should be doing and want to know

843
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,720
how they won't be in the next one of

844
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
these news stories

845
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,399
um

846
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,039
i don't want to say that

847
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,880
the public doesn't matter but um

848
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
from our perspective

849
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
yeah don't say that yeah

850
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
from yeah from from from we have a

851
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,640
business model and you're yeah

852
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,120
from the business model that i see is

853
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
to

854
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,240
talk to enterprises about what they

855
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
should be doing rather than talking

856
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
about public good yeah and uh

857
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
i am no longer in cisa i didn't work on

858
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,440
the colonial gas

859
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,200
example so i'll ask a question from a

860
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
distance without inside knowledge but

861
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,679
that's an example where typically

862
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,120
in a country

863
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,919
a public good like

864
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,320
oil gas public utilities it's it's a

865
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
responsibility of the public sector

866
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
but in our system of government we

867
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
delegate a lot of that the ownership and

868
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,880
operation to private entities so when

869
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,679
you have a breach like that

870
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,960
and people come monday morning

871
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,960
quarterback the decisions made

872
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,039
it seemed to me from the outside that

873
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,640
the right thing for shareholders might

874
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
be to preserve

875
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,399
integrity and billing and shut things

876
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,720
down but that that unilateral decision

877
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
might hurt the public interests of the

878
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
eastern seaboard for a while

879
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,399
so when you have a tension between

880
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
what's right for the enterprise and

881
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,240
what's right for the country or the

882
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,600
region

883
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
um i think there's an incredible story

884
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,360
here of

885
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
have do we need to recalibrate the

886
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,320
social contract between the

887
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,480
public-private partnership and

888
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,159
you can delegate operation from the

889
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,200
government to the private sector but

890
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,039
you're still accountable for it

891
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
so are we actually able to govern

892
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,519
reliable maintainable access to critical

893
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,880
infrastructure

894
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
or have we gotten out of balance and

895
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,279
i i found it really there were a couple

896
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,519
of decent stories about what happened

897
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,600
but maybe not the strategic implication

898
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
of that public-private partnership

899
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
yeah i'm having trouble organizing my

900
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,559
thoughts but i think it's because of

901
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,320
what you said that th

902
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,559
this is like a societal level

903
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,120
recalibration

904
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
that one could argue needs to happen

905
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,399
in the us

906
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,840
but then i'm also thinking about how

907
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,399
globally

908
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,320
like a thing about when we're thinking

909
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,399
about this you know the years of the

910
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,799
cavalry or you know since 2013 or just

911
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,880
like recent years of cyber security and

912
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,320
the security industry

913
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,679
like the

914
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
the private sector has been so

915
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
uh

916
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
just

917
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
has

918
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,960
has led so much of the narrative and and

919
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,039
shaped so much of the narrative

920
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
uh and and

921
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
sometimes in good ways and sometimes in

922
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,159
like court leading the horse ways

923
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,799
um so there's like a sort of parallel

924
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,039
thing there but i think that issue you

925
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,640
know some of what you were talking about

926
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
just now is us uh

927
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,559
centric but the the larger security

928
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,440
industry and like what people understand

929
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
to be the scope of cyber security topics

930
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
uh and even

931
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,519
like uh uh thinking about like the

932
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
concept of cyber war

933
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
so much of that has been driven by the

934
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
private sector

935
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
that i i can see why there is this like

936
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,000
decoupling that needs to happen or that

937
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
someone might feel needs to happen

938
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,760
because it that's sort of how all of

939
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,559
this

940
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,799
has sprung up and i guess that's sort of

941
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,640
the classic

942
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,519
like

943
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,559
black hat versus defcon thing of

944
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,320
well where's the space for all the

945
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,960
vendors to be and where's the like you

946
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
know economic engine of this whole thing

947
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,679
um and then

948
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,120
you know

949
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
like other folks in the community

950
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
feeling like

951
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,360
well

952
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,679
i just want to do my research and focus

953
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
on like what's actually impacting people

954
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
like i think it's a

955
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
big big issue

956
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,840
so i'm going to

957
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
float in a opinion you've triggered um i

958
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
also want to remind people that we do

959
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
have the mic in the room we also have

960
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,919
the streaming chat um so if there is a

961
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
burning question you would love to ask

962
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,279
either these two

963
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,039
fine journalists um

964
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,399
please do

965
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,600
um

966
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,480
while he's heading up there um i think

967
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,239
one of the areas that this dynamic got

968
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,560
it wrong was ransomware i think the the

969
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,960
hacker elite rockstars thought it was

970
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,560
boring

971
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,320
and we just kept paying it and we

972
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,520
created this juggernaut that's

973
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,480
unstoppable and i think one of the ways

974
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,760
i put it after rsa we were sitting in

975
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,320
the garden i said

976
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
the attackers have figured out how to

977
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,320
monetize the cyberpoor

978
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,239
defenders haven't

979
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,239
and it's going to be a feeding frenzy

980
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,239
it's so big now there's no stopping it

981
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,839
there's no single

982
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,000
even international move that's gonna

983
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,320
stop the business model

984
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,199
of unavailability no matter what you do

985
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,599
your unavailability can be monetized

986
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,520
and unless and until this becomes

987
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
interesting to either rockstar hacker

988
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,719
voices and or commercial coin operated

989
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
we've got a real public health issue

990
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,520
that was possibly preventable in its

991
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
infancy but it's it's it's not going

992
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
away anytime soon

993
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
the uh the government will set a lot of

994
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
the narrative there and i think that the

995
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
government right now is putting a lot of

996
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,079
the prep pulling out of that pressure

997
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,280
into two spaces one of the of

998
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,960
international

999
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
uh partnerships

1000
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
um which doesn't get as much coverage as

1001
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,880
the other one which is you know forcing

1002
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,240
uh which is you know requirements for

1003
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,359
security requirements through the

1004
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,280
executive order and things like that

1005
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,079
um

1006
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,920
it is a much broader topic than that but

1007
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,280
i think that for the most part when

1008
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,480
people

1009
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,359
look for coverage it's going to be

1010
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
what the government what the the cover

1011
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,440
what the what the

1012
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
elected person said

1013
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
they were doing

1014
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
um

1015
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,960
oh yeah

1016
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,759
all right

1017
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
we have a question

1018

1021
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,920

1022
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920

1024
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
not not just you too

1029
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,400
you're great but i'll i'll just say

1030
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
the press more broadly uh when it comes

1031
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,079
to stories and pitches and

1032
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,640
background etc

1033
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,118
um

1034
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,839
how do we keep up

1035
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,800
yeah it's really tough i always go back

1036
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,160
to

1037
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
um

1038
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,560
just trying to

1039
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,000
it's gotten tougher and tougher like we

1040
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
were talking about but i i just try to

1041
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,359
go back to having as wide a source space

1042
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,640
as possible people i know people i sort

1043
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,560
of know but who won't be freaked out if

1044
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,520
i dm them or you know whatever and just

1045
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,920
really trying to always be in touch with

1046
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,680
people and hearing about what they're

1047
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,160
thinking about from as many different

1048
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,400
uh perspectives as possible and that

1049
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,280
ties into what you were saying about how

1050
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,240
how to get the right voices into the

1051
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,079
right stories but there is

1052
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,480
you know every journalist like that's

1053
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,599
our job and we pour a lot of work into

1054
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,200
it but there is

1055
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
a limit to just like how many people we

1056
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
can know or how many sources we can

1057
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,160
maintain and relate you know those

1058
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
relationships so i think it's like an

1059
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,520
important ongoing question of combining

1060
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,760
all the journalists like networks and um

1061
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,599
efforts to do that

1062
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,560
to to try to do the full coverage you

1063
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,680
know because you really the beat is way

1064
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
too huge now for just like a few

1065
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,480
reporters to cover alone

1066
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
so that's on on that piece

1067
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
um in terms of uh

1068
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,640
how i am the cavalry can uh

1069
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,440
sorry i missed the microphone again

1070
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,599
in terms of how you can

1071
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,240
get more stories placed

1072
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
um

1073
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,480
reaching out is a good start

1074
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
i don't

1075
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
and not just reaching out

1076
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,160
through press releases and things like

1077
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,480
that if you pick your shots

1078
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,560
and just occasionally say this is

1079
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,680
important

1080
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
um i think most people will will listen

1081
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,520
um

1082
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,680
at least most people who

1083
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,520
have a sense of

1084
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
what you're what you're talking about

1085
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,160
will listen

1086
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
but i also think it's like the proactive

1087
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,079
thing of

1088
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,200
you know by the time you

1089
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,160
like

1090
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
implement network segmentation or

1091
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,599
something like it needs to have already

1092
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,359
been done it can't happen once the

1093
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,400
crisis is going on uh i think maybe it's

1094
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
sort of like that with reporters that

1095
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,079
it's

1096
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,680
it's helpful to

1097
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,800
just like be in each other's orbit

1098
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
so that you can then

1099
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
you know

1100
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,880
if one you know if i know one of you and

1101
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,200
we've you know met at b-sides and

1102
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,720
chatted a little bit and we keep in

1103
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,160
touch and send each other memes or

1104
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
whatever and then if you dm me and you

1105
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,520
say this is really important i really

1106
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,760
want you to look at this you know

1107
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,359
that helps a lot versus like my my email

1108
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,920
or what like my inbox is just like

1109
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,440
a hellscape

1110
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,000
like i can't keep up with and sometimes

1111
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
there are really important things in

1112
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,079
there signal tip line same way like but

1113
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,240
it's so difficult i'm always worried

1114
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
that i'm missing stuff so i think that

1115
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,280
personal connection you know like

1116
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
befriend your

1117
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,960
neighborhood journalist like now before

1118
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
you need them you know

1119
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,599
all right do you have a question i do oh

1120
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,839
there we go

1121
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,280
not step on the mic

1122
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,520
uh thank you for coming and i have a

1123
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,200
question since a lot of the news seems

1124
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,000
to be

1125
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
uh very kind of western-centric i was

1126
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,400
wondering if in your experiences and in

1127
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
your connection circles and your

1128
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,359
professional kind of working lives

1129
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,520
do you see a similar investment or

1130
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,200
divestment of resources of opportunities

1131
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,160
in

1132
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,599
international

1133
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,160
partners that you may or may not have

1134
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
places in like europe is obviously a big

1135
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
one but other

1136
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,920
non-like english-speaking countries you

1137
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
see kind of like a similar

1138
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
uh like oh we should kind of cover these

1139
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
like security things or

1140
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
do you believe that certain governments

1141
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,760
are more oppressive in that manner and

1142
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,680
that they go you should not report on

1143
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
these things otherwise your family will

1144
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,960
disappear

1145
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
forever

1146
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
that's a good question um we certainly

1147
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,599
have some good uk journalists but that's

1148
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,839
a fairly close partner to the us yeah

1149
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,000
joseph is great joseph cox yeah great

1150
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,839
dude

1151
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,079
he's one of the top joes

1152
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,319
we have a lot of joes yeah just a bunch

1153
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,920
just one too many

1154
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
i think there definitely is in

1155
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
uh and and like has been for quite a

1156
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,599
while but you know it's very fair that

1157
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,680
like the effects you haven't necessarily

1158
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,079
seen the fruits of this so much but i i

1159
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,640
think there has been like long-standing

1160
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,240
interest in doing

1161
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,119
more and more international coverage

1162
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,079
um like you're saying i think reporting

1163
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
uh

1164
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,800
getting

1165
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,839
uh

1166
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,520
working with sources in a way that's

1167
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,560
safe for them is difficult in a bunch of

1168
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,079
countries uh so that is like a factor

1169
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,119
but

1170
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,040
means it's all the more important to do

1171
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,319
it and

1172
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,400
just one other thing i would say quickly

1173
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,359
is like

1174
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,370
i think um

1175
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,680
[Music]

1176
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,599
this is another area where the the

1177
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,839
private

1178
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,800
security like threat intel juggernaut is

1179
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,119
like good but also

1180
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,520
you know limiting because

1181
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,119
that's a lot

1182
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,520
of uh how

1183
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,280
journalists but also the community in

1184
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,480
general uh hears about certain types of

1185
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,599
attacks and especially government uh or

1186
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,040
like apt

1187
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,839
uh

1188
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,839
activity in a bunch of different

1189
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,960
countries globally and um

1190
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,440
so we're all sort of at the

1191
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,880
mercy of

1192
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,040
those um that framing or or that uh

1193
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
yeah mindset yeah i think i think the

1194
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,040
the the

1195
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,359
the company with the most visibility in

1196
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,599
china is 360 right um and they publish

1197
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,079
in chinese

1198
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,040
and

1199
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,319
you'll have to forgive me for not

1200
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,440
knowing

1201
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,280
which which version of chinese because i

1202
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,720
can't tell the difference and that's one

1203
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,920
of the problems

1204
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,440
is uh there's a language barrier to the

1205
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
sole source

1206
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
to the person with the most telemetry on

1207
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,280
on a field on an area

1208
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,280
um

1209
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,160
i don't know how to fight that

1210
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
yeah it's a it's a fair question and i

1211
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
the cavalry is a pretty international

1212
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,598
movement and we

1213
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,079
i have been personally burned because of

1214
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,960
just translation issues um like when i

1215
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
was at the atlantic council for a while

1216
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,800
i made out of my way to call it cyber

1217
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,560
safety instead of cyber security to

1218
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,800
differentiate the cyber physical impacts

1219
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,480
and in some of the countries covering us

1220
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,240
they were the same word like there

1221
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
wasn't a different way to put it so here

1222
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
i am trying to mince

1223
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
and nuance u.s language

1224
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
and one of the stories almost got me

1225
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,440
attacked by anonymous i mean this is

1226
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,520
before the cavalry but like i said what

1227
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,680
i said i said it cleanly and clearly but

1228
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,560
it was

1229
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,240
lost in translation and an op was

1230
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,640
declared trying to destroy me and my

1231
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,119
family so it got called off you know we

1232
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,720
had some people from anonymous call it

1233
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,680
off but

1234
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,640
i'm probably more timid myself even

1235
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,000
though i'm a confident media trained

1236
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,119
person

1237
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,280
to get lost in translation so it's

1238
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,400
probably an error we could put some more

1239
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,880
deliberate focus into and specifically

1240
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
on things like our hippocratic oath for

1241
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
connected medic and medical devices or

1242
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,280
the s-bomb work we were delighted to see

1243
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,119
translations in french and german in

1244
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,400
japanese

1245
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,560
because when you're speaking some of the

1246
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,640
strategies are universal and translated

1247
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,920
and we've had some

1248
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
really powerful partners in singapore or

1249
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,640
elsewhere who cared more about some of

1250
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,000
these topics than some of our us

1251
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,359
partners did

1252
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,440
but i think we could be more deliberate

1253
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,839
in international reach than having

1254
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,440
researcher friends who could maybe be

1255
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
more confident in those

1256
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,480
areas

1257
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,640
this might seem like a hard transition

1258
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,920
but one i really want to get to because

1259
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,000
lily and i had some fascinating

1260
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
precursor discussions how many raise

1261
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
your hand if you've seen the the

1262
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,880
documentary film called um don't look up

1263
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,119
okay it really hurt for me to watch that

1264
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,440
um probably kendra too anybody this is a

1265
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,079
code task force it felt autobiographical

1266
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,319
um

1267
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,160
we have a

1268
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,240
i have been surprised and i'm usually a

1269
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
pretty grounded expectations even though

1270
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,599
i'm a dreamer it's usually pragmatic

1271
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,240
idealism but i was really shocked to see

1272
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,480
how how little people actually cared

1273
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,560
about loss of life and health care and

1274
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,440
i'm gonna

1275
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,800
do a little bit of an exposition here

1276
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,960
we keep hearing from health care that

1277
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,480
there's no money there's no staff

1278
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
there's no appetite there's no political

1279
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,680
will we're doing the best we can people

1280
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,480
die

1281
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
and they say until somebody dies

1282
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
you know we're doing the best we can

1283
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,839
so there was a story in germany of a

1284
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,040
woman who had a branson had her go

1285
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,760
too far away a very long ambulance

1286
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,280
diversion to the next near facility and

1287
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,000
now we have our first loss of life

1288
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,040
and

1289
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,920
it has since been refuted and debunked

1290
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,680
but maybe less so than you probably were

1291
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
told

1292
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,720
because we know that delays affect

1293
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,960
mortality and that in cyber introduces

1294
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,560
delays so if cyber introduces delays and

1295
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,640
delays and introduced mortality you know

1296
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,040
we we shouldn't be in even in the

1297
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,000
proximity of this but there's a palpable

1298
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,760
desire for the private sector in the

1299
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,280
hospital to say that no one's ever died

1300
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,880
no one's ever died

1301
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,200
and that one we let go of because it was

1302
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,280
debatable enough we let go of it and

1303
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,640
then on october 1st 2021 uh wall street

1304
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
journal front page talks about the baby

1305
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,760
who

1306
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,680
prior to the pandemic in alabama

1307
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,520
potentially um

1308
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,319
was a victim of degraded technology

1309
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,920
assist they said if we had had the

1310
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,440
imaging if we had known this we wouldn't

1311
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,720
there were text messages between the

1312
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,800
physicians saying had we known we

1313
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,880
wouldn't have treated the pregnancy this

1314
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
way

1315
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,920
so people are like okay we finally have

1316
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,280
a named person but then we say oh it's

1317
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,040
just an anecdote it's a one-off you know

1318
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,720
we can't shouldn't change policy over

1319
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,119
that well that same day our team at

1320
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,040
cisco task force public statistical

1321
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,720
proof that we could measure hospital

1322
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,280
strain associated with excess death

1323
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,680
in pretty large numbers and we could

1324
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,440
analyze regions hit hardest by

1325
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,599
ransomware to show that they were in

1326
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,520
those excess death stress zones for a

1327
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,079
projected amount of time so non-zero

1328
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,079
numbers of people

1329
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,839
lost their lives due to delayed

1330
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,920
integrated access to patient care in

1331
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,160
vermont in san diego and other parts of

1332
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,839
the country

1333
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,960
so

1334
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,800
we we kind of have this proof but what i

1335
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,240
was talking to lily about now that i'll

1336
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,160
get past the exposition is

1337
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,079
even really intelligent people even

1338
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,760
leadership people in the isacks and the

1339
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,119
secretary councils in the hacker

1340
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,880
community we still continue to say no

1341
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,040
one's ever died from cyber like we can

1342
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,280
actually have a smoking gun with a named

1343
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,720
victim we can have a smoking gun with

1344
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,480
statistical proof we can have them come

1345
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,319
out on the same day

1346
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,720
but there's something about slow moving

1347
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,400
this is a human psychology thing that

1348
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,240
maybe we could all try to simmer

1349
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,440
ourselves on

1350
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,640
which is

1351
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,319
these slow-moving threats these

1352
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,839
strategic threats we're really really

1353
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
bad at risk management as a species and

1354
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,680
we tend to like these bite-sized things

1355
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,200
where we have a control sphere maybe

1356
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,400
there's something we feel we can or

1357
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,480
can't do about it

1358
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,200
but i think my hyperbolic slightly

1359
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,119
exaggerated concern is nine years ago we

1360
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,720
were too early

1361
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
and now

1362
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,559
no one's coming back to tell the fuller

1363
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,920
story of

1364
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,839
these things and why we should be we

1365
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,839
should listen

1366
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,000
to the warnings and there are stories

1367
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,520
covered and you i don't want to put

1368
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,079
words in your mouth or um

1369
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,000
or tell them about the dumb thing i said

1370
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,480
is that true it wasn't done no no the uh

1371
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,680
but you said there are certain people

1372
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,880
that every time someone's like why

1373
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,000
aren't you covering this or why didn't

1374
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,359
you cover this there's usually evidence

1375
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,880
of it so can you get into the pro public

1376
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,079
like we're i'm trying to wrestle with

1377
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,000
why don't we have an easy way to talk

1378
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,640
about high impact slow moving threats

1379
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,880
like climate change or

1380
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,319
oh okay no this wasn't uh

1381
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,160
i thought we were talking about uh i

1382
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
know examples of stories and i i gave

1383
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,040
like a silly example uh but

1384
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,079
no i i

1385
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,240
just trying to think how to summarize i

1386
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,920
i do think there's a bit of there's a

1387
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,480
concept in general or like a thing that

1388
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,480
happens in general not just in this

1389
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,599
field where sometimes people will say

1390
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
why isn't the press covering x

1391
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,240
and

1392
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,079
often right we hear this all the time

1393
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,040
currently

1394
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,400
and uh my response just to myself you

1395
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,040
know internally as i'm seeing these you

1396
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,359
know arguments or whatever is like but

1397
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,240
there is coverage just no one wanted to

1398
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
read it no you know it didn't like come

1399
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,839
above the baseline of noise because no

1400
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,440
one was amplifying it no one was

1401
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,920
interested in it from the readership

1402
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,200
um and

1403
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,440
yeah one example i gave was like often

1404
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,599
when people say this there's like a big

1405
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,520
propublica investigation that happened

1406
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,839
five years ago or whatever about xyz

1407
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,240
thing that just everybody forgot about

1408
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,680
and you know but and there's other

1409
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,319
examples too uh you know and and

1410
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,800
sometimes it's my own coverage or joe's

1411
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,119
coverage or whatever where i'm like no i

1412
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,520
i did cover that like a lot you know and

1413
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,000
just no one read the stories or or one

1414
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,240
of them was big but you know then no one

1415
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,319
read the other stories to follow the

1416
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,720
narrative or whatever so i think that's

1417
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,200
one component of it but i

1418
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,800
and and so that's where we were talking

1419
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,760
about

1420
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,920
you know climate change as

1421
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,559
like i think that is a big

1422
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,119
potentially analogous example where

1423
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,640
people always said why isn't it on the

1424
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,960
front page why isn't it you know every

1425
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,319
single day

1426
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,720
and it's like well it's actually i i

1427
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,559
think genuinely a more complicated

1428
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,880
question about like the service

1429
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,760
that you know of news and what is

1430
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,079
newsworthy each day and it doesn't mean

1431
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,240
the coverage isn't happening but what

1432
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,280
people

1433
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,480
want to read more of is relevant to

1434
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,800
what gets covered more

1435
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,400
and there's just all these feedback

1436
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,880
loops that are kind of complicated but

1437
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
it's i mean it's not to make excuses at

1438
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,000
all i i you know i think it's just to

1439
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,880
say like these dynamics aren't so it's

1440
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,280
not always just why isn't it being

1441
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,200
covered sometimes things are based i

1442
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,359
think when people say why isn't it being

1443
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,599
covered they usually mean why isn't that

1444
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,760
the conversation on twitter

1445
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,960
this thing or why isn't it on the

1446
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,160
the prime time opinion shows or you know

1447
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,520
talk shows

1448
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,280
um and reporters don't really have

1449
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,000
control over that uh we can just

1450
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
you know go about our beats and

1451
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,359
submit things uh as we can but um

1452
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,119
i

1453
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,680
think for specialized news coverage

1454
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,800
areas

1455
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,359
um and that includes homeland security

1456
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,599
and national security

1457
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,720
there

1458
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,200
it's harder to

1459
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,119
for the public

1460
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,359
to keep multiple stories

1461
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,760
that are outside of like a very

1462
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,960
narrow set of parameters in mind at a

1463
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,280
time

1464
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,280
and i think people still view

1465
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,640
infosec

1466
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,280
as a specialized topic as opposed to

1467
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,119
something that no matter what your job

1468
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,440
is and no matter where you live

1469
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,319
it affects you at home and at work

1470
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,559
so i guess this is a i i got the hook we

1471
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,800
have like three minutes left so um we

1472
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,000
can continue the conversation in the

1473
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,480
hallway and throughout the day but um

1474
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,760
i guess where i'd like to end is maybe

1475
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,800
with a semi-rhetorical question which is

1476
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,640
i think this group has done incredibly

1477
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,359
important work to warn and to be calm

1478
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,680
voice reason and lay the groundwork so

1479
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,119
that we can be better prepared for when

1480
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,200
things go south i think now that things

1481
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,559
are going south

1482
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,640
a concern i have is when you let it go

1483
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,079
too far south and there's victims then

1484
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,000
you have knee jerk reactions and the

1485
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,079
entire thesis of what we started here

1486
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,079
was to be left a boom

1487
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,119
and be

1488
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,920
prepared for a more thoughtful planful

1489
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
response

1490
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,040
if you have advice of either the right

1491
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,119
all you know sibling organizations like

1492
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,280
propublica or documentary films or the

1493
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,520
use of fiction or

1494
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,000
alternative ways to enhance the yield of

1495
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,160
this mission whether it's right now or

1496
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,280
later

1497
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,040
i do think it's worth

1498
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,280
you know our own family's access to care

1499
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,599
and food water shelter safety that

1500
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,119
this group gets better at it i think

1501
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,040
everyone's trying really hard but we are

1502
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,960
very humbled and open

1503
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,960
to increasing our yield in alternative

1504
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,040
and creative ways and would treasure any

1505
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,760
advice you'd give us any last words from

1506
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,040
either of you

1507
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,839
yeah i would just say um same like

1508
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,559
appreciate all of you and um just want

1509
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,520
to be in touch

1510
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,280
uh

1511
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
