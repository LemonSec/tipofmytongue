1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
so without any further delay uh see

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,240
across you

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,879
all right hi uh good to see you i'm glad

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,520
you could all make it

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,559
so we're doing a presentation here on

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,519
reverse engineering real ms das game

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,199
from 1994

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,320
for fun

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
because we can't feel free to take

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,439
pictures of anything that's on the

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,960
screen nothing here is uh privileged or

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
an issue

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,840
so

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,119
uh

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,920
um my actual name is andrew luten i do

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
go by uh cpros corc pro for most of it

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,920
uh my early childhood consisted of

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,079
taking things apart making all my

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,040
battery powered things act up uh

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
yo learning how to put things back

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,640
together

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
after uh i had taken them apart

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,520
um and i got to the point where i wasn't

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,160
leaving any extra screws or extra screw

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
holes that is important

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
uh so i got bit by the computer bug and

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,079
uh in preschool by an apple two plus uh

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
computer using a 6502 processor

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,040
and um

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
yeah so

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,840
the basic deal with that was i'm not

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,240
kidding i got on that computer and i

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
either put it into a test mode or i made

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,840
something in apple basic that caused a

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
bunch of junk to scroll across the

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
screen computer teacher thought that i

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
had broken the computer which if you've

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
ever used an apple ii you can't break it

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,040
um and so they sat me in the corner

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
you know put my name on the chalkboard

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
didn't get my snack for the day

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
i was hooked

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
had to do computers how to have my own

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
so they were prohibitively expensive in

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
the 90s like

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,479
and it was really hard for me to justify

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
it or get one but i was going to do it

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
so what i ended up doing

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,320
quite a few years later was i was at a

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
computer swap meet and they had a pile

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
of original ibm pcs

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
um and i bought one for 42. and for my

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
42 dollars best 42 dollars i've ever

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
spent i got myself an ibm 5150 the

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
original pc a clicky clacky keyboard

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
um two five uh and a quarter drives 256k

57
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
of ram a monochrome green screen

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
and i my parents and me truck this stuff

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
home

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
and uh the first thing i did was take it

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
apart put it back together take it apart

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
put it back together learn exactly what

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
it was and i started upgrading it i put

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
a 42 meg hard drive in it 640k of ram

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
cga graphics

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
learned everything the hard way about

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
dip switches and jumpers

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,879
um so

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
after that i built my first computer at

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
nine i got my plus

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
at age 13.

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
um kind of funny story about that my mom

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
brought me to uh

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
icon uh business solutions who did a

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
plus testing

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,040
um and uh the front desk secretary said

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
uh

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,920
ma'am uh you're gonna have to you know

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
leave your son somewhere else for not a

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
daycare facility

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,040
my mom said oh no he's taking the test

82
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
so

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
so yeah so

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,920
that was fun so uh back then they

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
offered a good deal half off if you take

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
the brand new test and the old test and

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
whichever one you pass you get to have a

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
great plus certification i passed both

89
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
and i did better on the adaptive test

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,360
which i was supposed to do worse on

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
because he's supposed to ask you more

92
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
questions about stuff you get wrong

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,640
anyway i have to thank my parents for

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
being amazingly encouraging and

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
supportive thank you

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
um so now for something completely

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,360
different in 94.95 my parents bought our

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
first nice computer

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,519
that is a gateway 2000

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
75 megahertz it had the f div bug it was

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
a socket five uh cpu eight megs of ram

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,720
790 meg five meg hard drive a 2x cd rom

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
a 14 for uh fax modem vibro 16 sound

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
guard which is a cut down version of the

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
sound blaster 16. it came bundled with

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,519
some software and some games

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,720
um and one of them was this game called

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
the lawnmower man

109
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,239
so

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
i'm going to change video sources here

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
so i can kind of show you

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,480
uh

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
what what this game was and why it was

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
kind of

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,639
bonkers to me

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
so

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
we're gonna wait for that to come up

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,160
so keep in mind this is 1994.

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
and i need to adjust some things

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,259
[Music]

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
unfortunately when you're doing things

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,120
like this uh

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
you have to just make things up as you

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
go along

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
so the graphics in this game are pretty

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,080
pretty good because it's actually video

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,440
hang on let's recalibrate here

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
so this is actually gameplay right here

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,860
[Music]

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
so it goes right into this whole

131
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,199
sequence here

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
you'll see the catwalk

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
and this is having anyone here play

134
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
dragon's lair the arcade game

135
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
this is quick time events before quick

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,000
time events uh with coin is a term

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,039
so this expects you to press buttons at

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,759
a specific time

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,719
get

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
[Music]

141
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,080
so we'll get into the technology

142
00:05:47,080 --> 00:06:03,198
[Music]

143
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
and so okay so i missed that one but

144
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
this is good because you see

145
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
games were brutal back in the game

146
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,680
killing you

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
not enough

148
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,318
you ready for this

149
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:27,950
[Music]

150
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,039
[Music]

151
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,560
uh

152
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,329
[Music]

153
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
needless to say this made quite an

154
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,360
impression on eight-year-old me or

155
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,290
whatever it was

156
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,419
[Music]

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,880
so uh kind of cool thing

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
this is

159
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
your only pause screen in the entire

160
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,240
game

161
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
if you hit this button you have five

162
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
seconds

163
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
and then it restarts the entire game no

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
matter where you are if you accidentally

165
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,639
press the escape key up it's gone

166
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,680
so uh let me go back to the other

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
computer right now

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
so i hope that kind of gives you an idea

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,360
of what we're dealing with here

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
which is

171
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
complete insanity

172
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
so

173
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
this game made an impact but

174
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,599
clearly as you can see for the wrong

175
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
reasons

176
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
so

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,639
one does not simply run an ms-dos game

178
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
so getting this game to load is a

179
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
challenge if you're if you remember back

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
in the day

181
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,919
you had to edit your config assist your

182
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,919
autoexec.bat your emm386 your highm.sys

183
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,400
you had to configure everything properly

184
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,759
in order for your game to run usually it

185
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
broke other games and windows

186
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
so

187
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,560
there are terms that are very close to

188
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
each other but they're not quite right

189
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,800
so there's xms and ems memory i'm in dos

190
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
and uh

191
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
they're completely different things

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
so if you have one and not the other

193
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
then you're in trouble especially trying

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,559
to run a game like this this game

195
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,279
happens to use like xms memory

196
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,120
but if you did everything right you

197
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,399
configure it you remembered what you

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
changed so you could change it back

199
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,760
later so you could still boot windows

200
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
then you were fine

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,680
so as you saw you pressing escape at any

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
time exits you and dumps you to dos

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
there's no menu system there's no save

204
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
system there's no pause button puzzles

205
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
are timed and

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
they would fail you if you took too long

207
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
uh the pamphlet was vague about how to

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
play this game it was not intuitive

209
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
you're supposed to figure out how to

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,839
play this game by trial and error

211
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
um you got three failures

212
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
and that was game over and that's over

213
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
the entire game over all the different

214
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,959
levels if you failed it three times

215
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
you just restarted the game

216
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,839
um and of course the continue button had

217
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,920
a five second time delay and if you

218
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
didn't hit it well

219
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
tough

220
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
uh so yeah the the game used quicktime

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
events which is not to be confused with

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
apple quicktime i only remember apple

223
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,320
quicktime

224
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,959
um before the tournament turned and uh

225
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,000
it's like dragon's lair so

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,040
yeah so these video segments are bridged

227
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,839
by logic puzzles and captured video um

228
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
which i can show a bit later if i get

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
the time so neat things this thing was

230
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
way ahead of its time for 94.

231
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
like it was mind-blowing that it was

232
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,279
even possible to do this on a computer

233
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
you got full motion animation video and

234
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
audio you got some pretty cool music i

235
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,320
think

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
um the story picked up from where the

237
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
last movie left off so it's almost like

238
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
another movie in fact i kind of wish one

239
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
more man too

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
had had this plot from this video game

241
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
it would have been a lot better

242
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
um and it gave you hours of serial

243
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
gameplay so

244
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,399
how the hell did they do this in dos

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,320
that's the question i had

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,440
um so 28 years later

247
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
uh how to drop down a rabbit hole

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
so

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
how did we get here well it was just i

250
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,720
was i was thinking about it i was like i

251
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
want to get i want to dump the music

252
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
from this video game

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,560
because i think it's awesome and that's

254
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
why as well so why all of a sudden now i

255
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,800
don't know

256
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,600
but uh you know it's a good time

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
retro computing's big now and uh you

258
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,360
know

259
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
it's time to bring up some of the

260
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
interesting skeletons in the closet so

261
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
i came here for an argument not abuse so

262
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,120
if we look

263
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
if we look at our if we look at our

264
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
files on our cd we got all kinds of

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
stuff going on here this is not your

266
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
standard binary executable

267
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
um game this has

268
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
some really big files some really small

269
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
files everything in between the um eight

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,640
sx files which um are at the top there

271
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
uh like act granted act denied well that

272
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,360
sure sounds like it could be sound

273
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
effects right so

274
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
you know in my brain before i even start

275
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,200
opening things up in hex editor i want

276
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,839
to kind of see what the developers

277
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,800
uh did oh cool laser pointer

278
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
don't know how to use it but uh

279
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
oh it's green cool thanks

280
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
so uh but yeah these ones right here

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
they sure sound like uh you know audio

282
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
files to me so

283
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,320
a m um let's see let's see is there any

284
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
of them yeah there's

285
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,640
so

286
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,240
maybe a m is an animation file

287
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
uh brs uh

288
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,279
well the brs file that we've got

289
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,839
let's see where is that thing is uh

290
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
right here it's screen save so maybe

291
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
it's a screen saver

292
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
i don't know so uh we got another one

293
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
called lbm

294
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
and uh let's see where is that

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
very bottom okay so

296
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
lbm file

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,000
and we also have one called logo here so

298
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,120
logo

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
logo is probably an image file right

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
so we got map files um

301
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
maybe it's a keyboard map maybe it's

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,240
mapped to files i don't know maybe it's

303
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
an in-game app

304
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
um and excel

305
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
and

306
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
i really think this is our video

307
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
maybe our video and our audio

308
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
and sht let's not try to think about

309
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,200
that one too hard

310
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
um

311
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
but uh what we do know about them is

312
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
they're tiny like 658 bytes tiny

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,959
so what could they possibly be well

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,360
let's let's try and figure that out so

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,160
let's look at an hsx file first

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
bang it's a sound effect file

317
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
and we can figure out that it recorded

318
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,839
with whatever studio 16 from sunrises so

319
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
you jump down that rabbit hole and you

320
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,680
find out yes it's a product for the

321
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
amiga

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
you know it's a whole entire digital

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
workstation digital audio workstation

324
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
cool so now we know

325
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,519
that that file came out of an amiga

326
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
and since the card was for an amiga 2000

327
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
it probably came from the omega 2000

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
so maybe we can uh

329
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,480
you know work on that and think about uh

330
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
what there is uh as far as that's

331
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
concerned i need to grab um audio here

332
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
so bear with me just a moment

333
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
one part i didn't test

334
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
all right

335
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
so

336
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
we've got an audio file it looks like it

337
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
didn't play but that's fine with me it's

338
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
just basically it says access granted

339
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,639
so

340
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
we uh then need to look at the other

341
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
files

342
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
and uh what we what we found out is uh

343
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,399
that the lbm files

344
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,160
are actually

345
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
deluxe paint files which is another

346
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,959
popular program for the amiga

347
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,959
so we're starting to get a picture that

348
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,240
this game might have been actually made

349
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
on an amiga

350
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
this pc game this pcdos game was made on

351
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
amiga

352
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
so

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,639
we uh then take the animation files and

354
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,639
we take them and we take them apart

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
using this program

356
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
that's made to work with the amiga and

357
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
we find out

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
indeed

359
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,480
we have the precursor to jiff here which

360
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,920
is deluxe paint animation

361
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
how cool is that

362
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
we were able to actually open this up on

363
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
a pc

364
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
so now that's not the entire game

365
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,959
but uh

366
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,160
we need to start putting the pieces

367
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,000
together so

368
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
the map file

369
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
contains

370
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
all these different files and where they

371
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
are

372
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
so this is how the game actually knows

373
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,959
where they're installed

374
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,279
and that's important because you have

375
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
the ability to install all the animation

376
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
files on the hard disk not the video

377
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,320
files though

378
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
you can install i think up to like 50

379
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
megs of uh

380
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,639
of these animation files onto your hard

381
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,920
disk so it wouldn't have to load it from

382
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
the cd

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
but the game had to know where to where

384
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
to point them so it has when you install

385
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
it on the drive it hard codes it to

386
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
where the path was so if you make the

387
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
unfortunate uh

388
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
the unfortunate mistake of renaming that

389
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
path or that directory the game will

390
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,639
break because it's all hard-coded

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,759
so

392
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
what about this executable file that we

393
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
got here dtv play

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
well thanks to some people who actually

395
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
took apart the program we were able to

396
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
find the hidden switches

397
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
and kind of funny because we have a dos

398
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
program that uses case sensitive

399
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,279
switches

400
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,160
so

401
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,279
s

402
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
lower case we'll skip frames

403
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,920
s capital will actually override

404
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,600
which sht file we use sht files it turns

405
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
out we'll get to later

406
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
so uh

407
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,000
yeah it's crazy this program runs in

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
16-bit real mode

409
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
and basically takes complete control of

410
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,440
the computer

411
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
and uses all of its resources to play

412
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
these video files

413
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
so just really really neat stuff

414
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
um

415
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,320
so

416
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
i really want to find out the real

417
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
origins of this game so

418
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,240
um

419
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
i found

420
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,560
all kinds of weird weird things here

421
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,639
like

422
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,160
cdtv.device cdtv cd tv error so

423
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,079
i thought it was for commodore cd tv

424
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,279
because

425
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,800
you know

426
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
it would make sense it was one of in

427
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
commodore's interesting failed projects

428
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,079
um

429
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,120
they made a lot of mistakes like this

430
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
so

431
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
i'm curious

432
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
has anyone ever seen a commodore cd tv

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
before

434
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
so yeah it's uh

435
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
back in the day in 1991 it was a

436
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
thousand dollar console

437
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,119
so the people whining complaining about

438
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,760
the ps3 being 6.99

439
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,679
got nothing on this thing

440
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,640
so

441
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,400
it was basically

442
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,599
uh for all purposes an amiga

443
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,320
500 that was shoved

444
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
into a fancy case that kind of looked

445
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
like um you know a cd player

446
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
and they really compacted i don't know

447
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
if you can see that motherboard there

448
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
but it's crammed

449
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
and so

450
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
they released it in 91.

451
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,919
the movie came out 92 of march

452
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
the uh commodore cd tv was actually

453
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,799
discontinued in 1993

454
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
during the development of this video

455
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
game

456
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
and then they finally released it 94 for

457
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
the pc

458
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,280
so

459
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,520
pencil spoken gun probably

460
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,840
uh so

461
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
looking for the information on lawnmower

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,280
man and his potential connection to the

463
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,559
cdtv i found a guy named peter who

464
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,960
detailed the cdtv games that didn't make

465
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
it uh

466
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
and um the definitive cdtv retrospective

467
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
part two uh we wrote for uh amiga world

468
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,320
so he said the llama man sales curve

469
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
wound up as an ibm game but started out

470
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,120
as a cdtv project it is a series of

471
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
linked arcade flying and puzzle games

472
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,919
based around the rather silly movie

473
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
which i can definitely say is a rather

474
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,960
silly movie uh the game was well along

475
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,160
he says he saw the show in 93

476
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
but they dropped the project um

477
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
for something else

478
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
so

479
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
interesting

480
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
so if we look

481
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
um i was able to actually find out that

482
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
there were two different conferences in

483
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
93

484
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
um in germany so if anyone's got footage

485
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
of that i'd love to see if there's a cd

486
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,400
tv running the lawnmower man um in any

487
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
of that buried footage

488
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,120
i haven't found any yet though

489
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,160
so

490
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
my theory is that i think it's possible

491
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
to take the files that are on the cd

492
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,360
and actually make it run

493
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,679
on an original platform

494
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,480
so

495
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
um we've yet to decode the video files

496
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,080
uh as of yet but we're working on it um

497
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
i'm hoping that between b-sides and

498
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,919
defcon i can have some you know a whole

499
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
bunch of people who are smarter than me

500
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,200
take a look at it

501
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
and see what they need to see and

502
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,039
actually take the video and dump it

503
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,080
directly

504
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,200
i think that's going to be an

505
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
interesting fun challenge

506
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,919
and kind of what i'm hoping to do here

507
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,919
so my theory is that they might have

508
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
used a video toaster

509
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,039
in order to dump the files out um and

510
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,960
they probably use magneto

511
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
optical drives in order to actually uh

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
to actually take the footage

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,520
from the video toaster to the pc

514
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
or whatever dev platform they were using

515
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
then

516
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
and then burn it into the final so i

517
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
think these might be raw video toaster

518
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
files that's my theory on it and uh they

519
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
would include audio so it'd be kind of

520
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
like a precursor to avi it would still

521
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,559
be you know interlaced video audio just

522
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
in a format that you can't open with vlc

523
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
player or anything recent

524
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
so i do have an amiga 2000 i do not have

525
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,480
a video toaster i do not have the uh

526
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,440
appropriate licenses or equipment to

527
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
open up the files but maybe someday i

528
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,039
will

529
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
and then i'll be mistaken because if

530
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,559
they did something else but

531
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,320
again that's why i'm here

532
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,840
so

533
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
i hope that kind of gives you a

534
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,200
interesting background of some of the

535
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,919
technology that went behind this game

536
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,000
um

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
so i actually contacted

538
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,400
the pro one of the programmers who

539
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
worked on this game and he got back to

540
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,280
me

541
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
as soon as uh this talk was actually

542
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,000
accepted so i found out some pretty cool

543
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,840
things

544
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,679
um so

545
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
here are his words on it but i'll i'll

546
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,039
uh you know paraphrase some of this so

547
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
uh this just happened to be the best

548
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
seller they had and they had another

549
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,640
dude who ported it

550
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,960
to the to the pc

551
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,799
and this was actually meant for the

552
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,360
amiga not for the cd tv this was meant

553
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,320
as a full pledged amiga game which makes

554
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,559
a lot of sense

555
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
limitations in color palette

556
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,640
everything that you see the way that

557
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,320
they went about it the fact that they

558
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
used an amiga as a development system it

559
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
all makes perfect sense

560
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,520
um

561
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,360
so

562
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
he told me that he i was right that the

563
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,480
sht files were actually shot files they

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
actually set up the uh

565
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,360
the order that the video files run in

566
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,840
um which is fascinating to me because it

567
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
means that each one's a sequence and

568
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
what he said was

569
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
the way they made it work was they run

570
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,400
two videos at the same time

571
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
and depending on

572
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
what input you put in

573
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,799
it either gives you the fail or the the

574
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,480
one that doesn't fail it's actually

575
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
running the two at the same time even

576
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,400
though it's a single speed cd drive

577
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,159
and they did some pretty interesting

578
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,480
hackery to actually make that happen

579
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
as a result the input for the pc is

580
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,200
actually quite janky

581
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
it's not pulling

582
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,360
very quickly so you can be pressing the

583
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
button and it'll miss the pull so you

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
almost have to spam the button

585
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,200
for it to pick it up you know it's sort

586
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
of like you know when you're frantically

587
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
trying to press uh delete or f2 or f12

588
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,080
for your bias settings on a pc

589
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
so

590
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
yeah

591
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,039
the fun part about the actual pc version

592
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,320
was that he said that

593
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
he they had an interrupt request

594
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,600
blocking function in the program

595
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,640
and

596
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
it corresponded to when it was actually

597
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,440
reading

598
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,200
data from the disk so input from the

599
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,120
keyboard wouldn't actually modify the

600
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,280
data that was being run in through the

601
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
dma and such

602
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,520
so as a result you had no control during

603
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,799
a discrete function

604
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
and you really had no control at all

605
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
because you're just watching a video of

606
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,520
what happened after you hopefully put it

607
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,760
in the correct input

608
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
so

609
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
the fact that they actually made it work

610
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
is amazing to me

611
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,960
because they had just

612
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
so many crazy things that they had to

613
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
overcome in order to make this thing

614
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
happen

615
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,760
so

616
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
um right now i want to take some

617
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
questions uh before i actually have

618
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,240
someone try to play the game because i

619
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,919
really want you to see how crazy this is

620
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,760
hey how you doing thank you very much

621
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,600
for your time

622
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
i was wondering uh

623
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
when i think amiga sound i think mods

624
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
those mod files like they were like

625
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,960
sequenced yeah i used to play with those

626
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,919
a lot when i was a kid um

627
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,640
do you know like a big issue was like

628
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,240
they're porting all this from an amiga

629
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,159
to a pc what about all the licensing all

630
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,279
the libraries and stuff they have to

631
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,960
port i mean that just seems to make the

632
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,799
game prohibitively

633
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,960
like expensive to develop i think they

634
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,039
just hacked it they were just a game

635
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
studio of like a couple of people

636
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
i think they just hacked it and made it

637
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,080
work

638
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,000
they didn't even export it to wave or

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,520
anything they just made it work i think

640
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
most of the audio is actually inside the

641
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
video file the raw video file

642
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
um the only thing that's different is

643
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,159
the things that are that are like the

644
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,600
mod files which are these uh asx files

645
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
here

646
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
that i showed earlier

647
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,559
and these happen to have samples and

648
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,240
such and they must have written their

649
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
own home built player forum instead of

650
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,840
dealing with any of the licenses

651
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,159
yes

652
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,760
delhi player can play it

653
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
in fact i got it right there on deli

654
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
player so you can play the sound samples

655
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
but it's usually just drum loops or

656
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,880
maybe access granted or access denied

657
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,559
you know it's nothing

658
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,120
it's nothing really uh

659
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
is none of the music is in there

660
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
um let me see if i've got anything else

661
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,080
on that

662
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
don't think so

663
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
but yeah so that's pretty much it on

664
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
that um they just made it up as they

665
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,200
went along

666
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,320
and hacked it until it worked

667
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
any other questions go ahead

668
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,320
wait wait wait you gotta get the

669
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,080
microphone first sorry about that

670
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
that's my bad so the engine was made for

671
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
multiple games not just lawnmower man

672
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,080
have you explored any of those other

673
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
games and tried to get them to run as

674
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
well um i found that although the game

675
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,799
engine was used for some other games

676
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,559
they are so wildly different it's

677
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,480
ridiculous and one of the other engines

678
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,159
isn't even the same it's just named the

679
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
same

680
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
um pretty interesting

681
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,760
so

682
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,360
question for you um

683
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
is you know with

684
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,960
uh i know you're reverse engineering

685
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,799
this that makes sense and i probably

686
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,440
have this this disc somewhere i can't

687
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
find it but is it posted anywhere we can

688
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,200
get to it is it has it gone into the

689
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,440
common domain yes uh you can grab it on

690
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
archive.org

691
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
um you just type in the lawnmower man

692
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,919
and you can grab the iso of it

693
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,640
um and uh it's there for uh messing

694
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,039
around with and uh

695
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,039
it's handy and if you want a physical cd

696
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,640
i can give you one of those too because

697
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
i got a couple of extras

698
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
yeah so uh let me get this game set up

699
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
um actually while i'm doing that let's

700
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,799
see here

701
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
oh i got one more thing i want to do

702
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,720
first because i think this is going to

703
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
be funny um remember i told you that

704
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,400
there were logic puzzles in this game

705
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,760
well

706
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
i'm going to pull one of those up right

707
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
now

708
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,559
so uh do

709
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,840
who here is good at logic puzzles

710
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,439
let me uh get the audio in here

711
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
all right it goes in the one that's

712
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,840
underneath the volume knob

713
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
so this is one of the one of the

714
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,159
stumbling blocks i ran into as a kid was

715
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,080
this game has these logic puzzles in it

716
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,039
um

717
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,799
anyone want to give it a shot because uh

718
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,320
you have to come up here and act pretty

719
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,279
quickly

720
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
i'll try and give you an idea of what's

721
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,559
going on

722
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,919
but it's more fun to watch people

723
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,240
struggle so anybody

724
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,480
anybody at all okay you come up here

725
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,480
give him a hand

726
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
no don't worry

727
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,520
so uh this logic puzzle each column is a

728
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
separate puzzle so don't look at the

729
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
ones to the right just look at the one

730
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,480
to the left

731
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,720
and it is a

732
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
one of these things doesn't belong you

733
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,880
can ask the audience for help okay

734
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,559
up and down

735
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,320
moves it up and down so just wait for it

736
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
to come up first and you'll see a little

737
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,360
red cursor that selects it

738
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
and you have to get four of these

739
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,679
puzzles right past

740
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,459
[Music]

741
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,960
thank you

742
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,159
so uh

743
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,279
which one of these doesn't belong

744
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
all right so go down to the six and

745
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
press enter

746
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,799
wait for it

747
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,799
all right uh which one of these doesn't

748
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
belong

749
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
all right presenter

750
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,890
[Music]

751
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,050
any idea in this one

752
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:05,220
[Music]

753
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,159
so you can see that this would have been

754
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
a stumbling block for eight-year-old me

755
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
right

756
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,679
[Music]

757
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,080
thank you

758
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,399
so yeah

759
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,480
that was just an example of some of the

760
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
crazy things that are actually in this

761
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
video game

762
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,679
so i thought i thought you'd definitely

763
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,440
enjoy that

764
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,279
so um there are plenty of other

765
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,600
interesting things um like the fact that

766
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,679
in the second level they reverse the

767
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,440
controls on you

768
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
um

769
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,559
so

770
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
did you bring this level selector yeah

771
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
it's a completely batch system i learned

772
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
how to make batch menu systems a long

773
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,159
time ago

774
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,880
and uh basically all it is is i'm just

775
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,799
running a command that brings up the gtv

776
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,480
play and selects the level

777
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,960
manually

778
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,799
so uh

779
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,399
they switched to controls because you're

780
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,880
in an airplane now down is up and up is

781
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,919
down

782
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,440
but they don't tell you that anywhere

783
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
you have to find out through trial and

784
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,240
error

785
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,679
but look at this

786
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,679
1994

787
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,429
[Music]

788
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
so the way they did this was each one of

789
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,600
these segments is a video file

790
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,320
and then they string them together in

791
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
order to form whatever track they want

792
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,199
oh yeah you have to shoot too

793
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,840
nice

794
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,640
so this game captivated me for hours

795
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,000
because well it was interesting and very

796
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
difficult

797
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,919
and also it crashed a lot too i remember

798
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,919
which you know if you spent eight hours

799
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,000
getting through a game

800
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
and then it crashes

801
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
you know you're upset or if someone

802
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,120
comes in and presses the escape key

803
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,420
it was like no

804
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:17,679
[Music]

805
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
so i hope you guys enjoyed this that's

806
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,158
all i've got
