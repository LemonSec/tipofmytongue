1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,599
welcome everybody

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,760
uh this is panel discussion today is on

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,920
software bill of materials and we have

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,080
with us fortunate to have a great panel

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,360
that we're going to discuss and talk

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,280
about where we stand today with it and

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
where we plan to go with software bill

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
of materials or s bomb as we've got to

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,880
let her speak first

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
so uh

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,840
katie would you like to introduce

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
yourself yes sure hi

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
i'm katie bratman i work at new york

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
presbyterian hospital as part of the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,640
vulnerability management team and also

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
as part of the daggerboard development

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,719
team we'll be talking a little bit about

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,200
daggerboard today it's an sbom analysis

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,160
tool

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,800
adam hi i'm adam kojak um i'm um a

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
developer at new york presbyterian

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
hospital as part of the information

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
security team

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
alan

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,360
i'm alan friedman i'm from the

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,640
government i'm here to help i'm from

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
sisa and i'm the guy who doesn't shut up

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
about us bomb

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
and lastly my name's christopher gates i

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
am a medical device developer and an

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
expert in embedded product cyber

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,040
security and i've worked with alan now

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,119
for seven years on various projects

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
something like that yeah

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,400
so the first question here is uh why do

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
we need an s bomb

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
so

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
if you go to the store and you buy a

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
twinkie it comes with a list of

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
ingredients uh to me it's just kind of

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
baffling

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
that the most important software in the

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
world doesn't have the same level of

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
transparency as we expect from a

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
non-biodegradable snack

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,840
uh

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,079
the important analogy of sort of that

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,280
list of ingredients that list of

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
ingredients by itself

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
won't magically save you

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
but one

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
would you buy from someone who couldn't

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
tell you

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
what they were encouraging you to eat or

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
in this case have your life depend on so

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
the value of doing it even if you can

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
never touch the data yourself you still

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
want someone to know that they have it

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
but the other thing is right you can't

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
do all of the things that we might do

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
with a list of ingredients uh right

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
protect your family from allergies

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
vulnerabilities uh follow

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,040
a uh

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
a certain religious based restriction

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
right the analogy there might be hey i

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
don't want things from certain types of

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
development environments or countries on

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
my network for certain reasons

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
so it really enables a lot of great data

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,560
to say or it's the data layer that

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
allows us to sort of think more broadly

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
about different kinds of risk

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
um i'll let you guys jump in about why

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
it's important for your orgs yeah so we

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
work in healthcare and where s bombs

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
really come in handy for us what we're

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
seeing is with medical devices so

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
oftentimes what happens is like we get a

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,160
medical device it's thrown on our

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
network we can scan it with a

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
vulnerability scanner but we don't get

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
the full picture of what it's made out

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
of that list of ingredients and so this

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
is where an s bomb can really help us we

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
can take an s-bomb before we buy the

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
device in our

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,599
purchasing process and then analyze it

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,360
and say do we really want to continue

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
with purchasing this

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,959
if there's a risk that was found how can

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
we mitigate it before implementing it

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
and so on

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,159
so i'll join with one more thing

95
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,799
there are organizations in the world

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,959
that only use like six types of software

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,680
right if you are just a traditional bog

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
standard enterprise then

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,000
s-bomb is gonna be nice for you but

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
there's going to be public security

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,480
advisories for your microsoft products

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
your cisco products right those have

103
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,440
mature product security teams and

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,920
data about vulnerabilities and risks in

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
those products is well documented and

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,159
easy to access

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
what we're talking about in the cavalry

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
track is a very different world right

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
it's the world of things that are

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
literally matters of life and death

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
those tend to be much smaller

112
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
organizations that produce them

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,519
and

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,280
yes some of them are starting to do

115
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
vulnerability disclosure and security

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
advisories but often the risk is not

117
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,560
going to be

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
this particular widget

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
uh in part because they haven't they

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
don't have security advisories and also

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,040
because

122
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
someone may not have developed a

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,720
targeted attack for a foothold

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
on that product the risk is sort of

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
automated scanning tools that are going

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,199
after some of the components and so

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
that's why particularly in safety

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
critical world medical infrastructure

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,199
ics

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
having that understanding is going to be

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
important and the last thing is right it

132
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,040
doesn't always feed into hey i need to

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
patch this some of you are familiar with

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
just how hard it is to patch something

135
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
that if i unplug this

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
people lose power people lose water

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
people die

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
but what we can do is start thinking

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
about it as more maturely of oh there's

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
a potential risk here so uh my long-term

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
plan is segment my network my long-term

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,199
plan is work with my threat intel to

143
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,720
sort of see if there's anything being

144
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
disclosed so again it sets up the longer

145
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
term risk especially in our cavalry

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
mission space

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
in a word it's all about transparency

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
and it allows you to assign risk to the

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
end user because somebody manufactured

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,479
something here you manufactured this box

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
or that

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
particular projector or that wireless

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
access point that's sitting over there

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
we look at that and as engineers we go

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
oh i know what that is and i can do a

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
physical attack on it tear it apart

157
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
reverse engineer it all right but as a

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
user

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
what they don't know they're bringing

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
this in and putting it into their

161
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
environment and potentially affecting

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
their environment their neighbors

163
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
environment everybody's environment i

164
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
mean we've seen a lot of denial of

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
service here distributed denial of

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
service attacks so it's actually more

167
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
than just the 16 critical

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,280
infrastructures the united states it's

169
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,199
everybody we don't want another marybot

170
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
type of episode again

171
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,199
transferring that knowledge to the end

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,440
user so they can say how much risk do i

173
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
feel comfortable with

174
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
right oh this has got a vulnerable

175
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
version of openssl in here i can live

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
with that i don't really care and some

177
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
people will other people will take it

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
offline and pull it out so it is about

179
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,080
disclosing all of that information not

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
keeping it a secret moving it to the

181
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,199
people who really are going to be

182
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
affected by it and that isn't the people

183
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,840
who manufactured it

184
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
so about four years ago

185
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,759
uh

186
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
i was working with alan on another ntia

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
project that had to do with updating

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
firmware and how you patch and do

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
upgrades of firmware and for devices in

190
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
the field and we rolled off that and

191
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
alan said hey i'm thinking about working

192
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,840
on another project here

193
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,199
that's called a software bill of

194
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,919
materials i said oh what's that

195
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,840
he says it's kind of like a list of

196
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800
ingredients uh-huh

197
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,479
of what goes into your products i went

198
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,520
hey you know

199
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
what are we going to do a month of that

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,919
i mean that's going to be a short

201
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,960
project

202
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
that was four years later i hadn't a

203
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
clue what all the edge conditions were

204
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,319
that we looked at

205
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,319
and in that period of time allen put

206
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
together um

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
multiple working groups that cover

208
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
different aspects of software build

209
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
materials

210
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
but they all consisted of experts in the

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
field

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
and really humbling experts i mean i

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
quickly realized just how

214
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,840
ignorant i was of what this environment

215
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
required and how to handle this and to

216
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
this day i still find things that's like

217
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,680
oh yeah i didn't think about it that way

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
that somebody else already thinks about

219
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,720
great multidisciplinary group nobody

220
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
nobody heard cats like allen

221
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
all of these people are experts they're

222
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
we're all egocentric a-holes all right

223
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,280
and we all have our opinions and this

224
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
man would manage to keep us going all in

225
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
the intended direction and everybody

226
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
working together uh you know if we spot

227
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
that uh comet that's about to hit the

228
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
earth and we need a team to

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
mitigate that i want him leading it all

230
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,599
right so it's been really interesting

231
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,080
and very educational over this period of

232
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
time and now recently allen moved from

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
ntia to csa and where this new working

234
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
groups have started up so

235
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
ellen i've talked too much already

236
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
what what are your what's your feeling

237
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,840
on the work groups both at ntia and csa

238
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
first of all flattery gets you

239
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
everywhere thank you um

240
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
the and and this is actually what i love

241
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
about what we built for the s bomb

242
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
community right it's always very clear

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
very much not my idea in fact since i

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
joined government pretty much every idea

245
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
i've stolen from the cavalry and said

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
okay they start off with a great idea

247
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
let's actually try to use uh the flag

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,599
behind us to pull together communities

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,159
to make it happen so i want to uh doff

250
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,880
my hat to uh josh and bo and everyone

251
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
who's been part of the cavalry i think

252
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,399
it's it's this is what it's supposed to

253
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
do it's supposed to sort of take ideas

254
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
mature them and then hand them to folks

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
who can implement them

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,640
so

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
uh the first phase we have to do is

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,120
actually come up with a shared

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
definition

260
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
the idea of an s bomb as chris said

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
is is not that complicated but we need a

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
couple things one we need a shared

263
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,839
vision of what it looks like uh and no

264
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
one had actually sort of articulated

265
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
this is what an s-bomb is these are the

266
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
boundary conditions and how to make it

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
happen so the first years was focusing

268
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
on the what the why and the how

269
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,040
uh

270
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
and

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,000
there are the

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,839
good news is there was at least one data

273
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,800
format that could transfer and to convey

274
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
s-bomb in a standardized fashion the bad

275
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
news is there was more than one uh and

276
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
that's some fun that we still have is

277
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
sort of managing the data formats uh

278
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
we're gonna have a meet up in right

279
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,519
after this if anyone wants to talk more

280
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,800
about that

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
so we're now at a stage or last year we

282
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,399
would have staged where we have the

283
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,360
basics

284
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
there's no reason why an organization

285
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
cannot start producing s-bombs asking

286
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
for s-bombs thinking about how to use

287
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,120
them

288
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,279
our focus now is on operationalization

289
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
scale and automation right if we can't

290
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
do this if we can't integrate this data

291
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
into all the other things that we care

292
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
about in security then we're not going

293
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
to make the progress we need

294
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
uh right my vision three four years from

295
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,079
now is that we're actually not talking

296
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,560
about s-bomb as a unique thing it should

297
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
just be a standard part of our security

298
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,920
ecosystem the same way that right most

299
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
of us don't spend our days thinking

300
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
about cves there is a small community

301
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
that does but it's really we just

302
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
integrate it into how we think about our

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
security data

304
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
so

305
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,880
the plug for the work that's going

306
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,839
forward

307
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,279
uh if you'd like to get involved and

308
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,360
i'll remind you at the end uh we've got

309
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,079
a couple of uh focus points one is uh

310
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,920
cloud and sas

311
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,160
a lot of the focus on s-bomb thus far

312
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
has been on on-prem software which makes

313
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,920
sense right i have to defend it it's on

314
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,680
my network uh and certainly in our

315
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,040
safety critical domain around the

316
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
cavalry uh that's huge but i would and

317
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,240
you guys can tell me if i'm wrong i

318
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
think most medical devices now have a

319
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
cloud management component right

320
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
frequently yeah pretty quietly uh and

321
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
same is true in ics the same is true in

322
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
in a lot of other in automotive

323
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,120
so we need to be able to tell a story of

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
what does transparency mean

325
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
for a sas application that may have a

326
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
daily or hourly build

327
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,240
uh and could be very large so we want to

328
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,240
tell stories of use cases and then

329
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
ultimately implement it right so

330
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
does the s-bomb of a container is it

331
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,680
just the application logic is the

332
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
application logic in the os is it the

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
application the os and the orchestration

334
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,760
we want to sort that out we want to do

335
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
that with both producers and people who

336
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
use that data defenders

337
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
the second piece is going to be focusing

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,440
on tooling

339
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
how do we

340
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
make sure that if two different

341
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,000
suppliers or two different open source

342
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
projects produce an s-bom they're

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
reasonably similar uh and then we're

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,079
going to talk a lot about consumption

345
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,839
and the great tool that nyp has

346
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,600
developed in a little bit

347
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,480
we're also going to be focusing on

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,079
um

349
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,600
moving this data around so how do we

350
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
move all this metadata around especially

351
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
the complex supply chain so it's got to

352
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
go from you know an rtos vendor to a

353
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,079
medical device manufacturer to a

354
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
reseller to

355
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
the hospital

356
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
and then the last piece uh is going to

357
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
be continuing some work that started

358
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,399
ntia

359
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,760
uh which we call the awareness and

360
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
adoption group uh which was very ably

361
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
run by audient josh uh

362
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
and that is to sort of help think about

363
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
one how do we make it easier and cheaper

364
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
for organizations to uh engage in s-bomb

365
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
and also how do we coordinate all the

366
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,120
different things that are happening

367
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
around the world so right now there's

368
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,399
some work that's happening at the

369
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,320
international medical device regulatory

370
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,760
forum one of chris's favorite

371
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
organizations

372
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
uh there is there's great work happening

373
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,600
in all sorts of different corners of the

374
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
ecosystem we want to make sure that

375
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,480
there's a common hub to share

376
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
information

377
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,680
absolutely and when we started off i

378
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,200
mean really the only person i'd ever

379
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
heard talk about software billion tills

380
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,079
before allen was josh and josh started

381
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,680
this and he was sort of out there alone

382
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
and we all went okay i don't know what

383
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
that means and kind of ignored all that

384
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
but in these working groups he really

385
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
set the pace with crawl walk run uh and

386
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
how we implement that and we have been

387
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
crawling for the last four years

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
literally the we spent a number of weeks

389
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,680
deciding how to spell s bomb i'm not

390
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,440
kidding okay

391
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
is it a lowercase or a you know

392
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
uppercaseout all right there were things

393
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
like that and we started at that level

394
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
and now we have all these tools and

395
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
techniques of how to apply this more

396
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,880
importantly we've got an executive order

397
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
that came in that now makes it not just

398
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
little medical that's involved because

399
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
they were the first ones into it but the

400
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
16 industries of that are critical to

401
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
the infrastructure united states so now

402
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
we have vendors and organizations that

403
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
are looking at this saying oh yeah i

404
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
need to supply you with an s bomb

405
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
we're moving from crawling we're into

406
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
walking what is run look like and how do

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
we get there that's what we're doing

408
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
we're moving forward this is both an

409
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
open source

410
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
problem and a proprietary you've got

411
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
tools from both sides

412
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
and that's where we are right now we're

413
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,199
right now and walking and trying to head

414
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
toward that running

415
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,440
so um

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
i keep talking about medical because

417
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
that's what i do is make medical

418
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,639
equipment but there's a lot of other

419
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
industries that are right behind us in

420
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,000
some cases they might be ahead of us i

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
mean automotive comes to mind they're

422
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,519
very much into this and certainly it's

423
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
not just the united states it's across

424
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
the entire world countries like japan

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
and stuff are very interested in this

426
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
and what are you guys seeing are you

427
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,000
getting other interesting you know

428
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
comments from other industries or i'm

429
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
going to put it to all three of you

430
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
or even from other hospitals besides new

431
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
york press and what does this look like

432
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,959
is there interested in adopting this and

433
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
getting ahead of this ball

434
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
uh i do think something that's

435
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
interesting in the hospital field is

436
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
we've seen some hospitals start by like

437
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
when they negotiate new contracts with

438
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
different vendors saying okay well when

439
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
you provide us with a medical device we

440
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,360
need you to provide us an s-bomb as well

441
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,800
otherwise we won't

442
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,920
sign this

443
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
so that's one way that people are really

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
pushing s-bomb in healthcare

445
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
money works money always works don't

446
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
count on somebody's better nature if

447
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
it's in their financial interest you'll

448
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,079
have an s bomb the next day

449
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,920
and then i think something interesting

450
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,800
that's come from daggerboard is so we

451
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
publish daggerboard it's open source and

452
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
it's on github and we're seeing people

453
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
that are wanting to contribute they're

454
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
kind of interested and recently we were

455
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
asked okay so how can the results from

456
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
daggerboard integrate with an asset

457
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,720
management system and that's something

458
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
that we'll talk more on later but it's

459
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
kind of an interesting idea that's

460
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,719
really pushing us bomb further

461
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
so the tools that have come out of this

462
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,560
like daggerboard and we're seeing them

463
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
break up to it as we first got into this

464
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
in ntia early on we realized we had to

465
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
do authoring tools because it's a

466
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,880
chicken and egg problem

467
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,399
and we've got to start somewhere all

468
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,759
right nobody was asking for this but

469
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,120
then nobody could create one even if

470
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
they were asking for it nobody could

471
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
consume one nobody could distribute one

472
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
so we're starting to see these tools now

473
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,639
come out for the the two major formats

474
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,839
spdx and cyclone dx that are used for uh

475
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,639
software build materials and the tools

476
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
are there we're starting to see more

477
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
these pieces of the chain over its life

478
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,000
cycle fall into play and and tools like

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,880
daggerboard are definitely it and uh i

480
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
think that's good that we're seeing both

481
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
commercial ones i hope they hang in

482
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
there long enough to see success as well

483
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
as open source ones like daggerboard and

484
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
uh at this point we've been talking

485
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
about daggerboard and why all this but

486
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
uh adam and katie

487
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,560
history of daggerboard where did this

488
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,959
come from i when i think of open source

489
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,600
my first thought is not a hospital uh so

490
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,320
how did this how did this come about

491
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
as the fact that you guys created one of

492
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
the better tools out there yeah i think

493
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
that we feel really lucky to be on a

494
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
hospital information security team and

495
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
have the opportunity to make this tool

496
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
actually it was a lot of fun but

497
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
basically where we started was so arcizo

498
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,119
he's a member of the healthcare working

499
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
group proof of concept for s-bomb and

500
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
based on some of the meetings that they

501
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,799
had he came out with this idea that was

502
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,760
hey

503
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
uh we have the resources i think we want

504
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
to make this tool that makes it easy to

505
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
take an s-bomb and analyze it find all

506
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
the vulnerabilities associated with it

507
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,439
and report it so that the user really

508
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,679
doesn't have to do that much because

509
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
there wasn't anything out there that was

510
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
like super freely available at the time

511
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
so

512
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
that's where the whole idea came from

513
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,120
was let's make this easy to use and free

514
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
and here we are now we actually managed

515
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
to make this app open source it and it's

516
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
free

517
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
something that was kind of interesting

518
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,919
along the way was it's just like any

519
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
other sort of open source project where

520
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
we started really small we had

521
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
the ability to do one thing like a

522
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
script that analyzed s-bombs and now we

523
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
have this project that's just grown a

524
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
ton it can do a bunch of things um we'll

525
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
see in a minute in a little bit like

526
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
we're going to add more features have a

527
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
version too uh and because it's open

528
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
source we are always looking for people

529
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
that want to contribute and work with us

530
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
yeah and it started out as a beta

531
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
project originally by the vulnerability

532
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
team

533
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
and we linked up as the devops team just

534
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,559
to make it revamp the ui make it easier

535
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,799
for the analysts to use as a whole see

536
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,480
all your vulnerabilities in one place

537
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,960
all the packages in one place as well as

538
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
making open source which was really one

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
of the main goals for getting this app

540
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,160
uh

541
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
out there

542
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
some of you folks i may have undersold

543
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
what an s-bomb is you're thinking hey

544
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
i've used three pieces of libraries and

545
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
frameworks and operating systems in my

546
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,120
product in my device that i've created

547
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,760
why do i need tools like daggerboard

548
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,039
and the answer is transitive

549
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,520
dependencies

550
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
are you all aware of log4j and what

551
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,679
happened last december okay yeah i'm

552
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
getting a lot of head now it's good okay

553
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
log4j is a very commonly used java

554
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
library for implementing logging so

555
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,320
you're sitting there at your day job and

556
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
one of the requirements says oh my

557
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
application has to have logging first

558
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
thought that comes to your mind is log4j

559
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
it's used by everybody in fact some 80

560
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,080
000 projects have used log4j

561
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
so you reach out you include it

562
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
when you include log4j you go hey that

563
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,200
would be one of my elements in my

564
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
software bill of materials and indeed it

565
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,679
would

566
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,720
but there are 294

567
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,919
sub dependencies in log4j that you as a

568
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,840
developer have no clue you just brought

569
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,000
into your product

570
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,360
and with

571
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,919
intentional corruption of these public

572
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,640
libraries skyrocketing last year it was

573
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
650 percent the year before that was 400

574
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
and some percent i don't know what it's

575
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,760
going to be this year we just heard

576
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
today about pi pi there were 10

577
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,600
libraries commonly used libraries in pi

578
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
pi that have been intentionally

579
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
corrupted to harvest credentials

580
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
people are poisoning these repositories

581
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
so if you have 294 of those

582
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
sub-dependencies you can't do that

583
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
manually

584
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
that's why you need tools like

585
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,919
daggerboard and other tools to go there

586
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
and look at this and tell you what it is

587
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
on a daily basis to come up and say oh

588
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
this one's buried 17 levels deep and we

589
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
found it here and it's we now have a

590
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
known vulnerability that's in this

591
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,559
product

592
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,480
so it is the only way it's where

593
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
everything in cyber security is headed

594
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,039
you've got to automate it all of this is

595
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
becoming way too complex way too big for

596
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
any person or group of people to do with

597
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
a manual process so tools like

598
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,320
daggerboard accent and with that let me

599
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,280
stand out of the way and why don't you

600
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,840
do a demo of daggerboard

601
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
i'll sit up here with ellen wow thank

602
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
you thanks for keeping me company but

603
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
yeah by the way uh we're originally

604
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,640
under direct i was like where's your

605
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
jacket i don't understand we had a whole

606
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,559
plan

607
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,840
didn't happen

608
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
all right so let's go over

609
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,200
you know

610
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
what's important when we built this

611
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
application so s bombs we need them all

612
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,039
in one place but we need to start at the

613
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
design level so and i don't want to bore

614
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
you guys with the technical stuff but

615
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,039
i'm going to go over pretty much how

616
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,600
simple it was just to start the project

617
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
and what features it had so first and

618
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,120
foremost like we use the django

619
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
framework just to start the application

620
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,600
to build the as a web application django

621
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
is very friendly with it's very data

622
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,679
driven very friendly with using data and

623
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,360
you know using sbom data it worked in

624
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,559
our favor

625
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,480
so and mainly

626
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
the main tool is to scan and parse the

627
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,200
s-bombs and being able to scan based on

628
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
spdx or cyclone dx

629
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,600
another thing was to be able to

630
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,919
integrate it within any application and

631
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,159
that's where we had ldap and local

632
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,159
authentication so you could implement in

633
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,480
your your own and we have fancy charts

634
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
and graphs all over the place so any

635
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
analyst could look at all the all the

636
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,159
graphs that are needed there and most

637
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
importantly the open source that we made

638
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
it for open source purposes

639
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
so our app doesn't generate s-bombs and

640
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
we want to be clear with that um

641
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,400
s-bombs should be provided by the

642
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
manufacturer uh but if an s-bomb needs

643
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,039
to be created from a manufacturer so if

644
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,120
you're from a manufacturer um it's very

645
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,919
easy to build and that we for for us

646
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,440
whenever we need to build one we use

647
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
sift which is a great tool and it's

648
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
really easy it's just a one-liner um

649
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
just you could connect it to your docker

650
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
image or your requirements and produce

651
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,919
all the s-bomb in any format in cyclone

652
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,760
dx or spdx

653
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,559
any format that's required

654
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,159
so for daggerboard what are the

655
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,240
important tags in this case for this

656
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,039
this is an example of an spdx document

657
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,000
and

658
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,679
the document name we use the document

659
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,240
name the

660
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
creator the organization the package

661
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,360
name and the package version those are

662
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
the four main tags that we use for all

663
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,120
the analysis that we perform uh within

664
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
the application yeah so

665
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
in a minute we'll show like an actual

666
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
demo of daggerboard all the data you see

667
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
in daggerboard it's just coming from

668
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,720
these tags mostly in an s-bomb file

669
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
yeah and this is just a quick example of

670
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
how easy it is to upload an s-bom within

671
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
our tool

672
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
pretty much you go to the upload

673
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,039
choose the spd-x or cyclone dx document

674
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,320
submit it

675
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,799
and you are prompted and the analysis

676
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,039
begins it's all automated that way you

677
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,280
don't have to go through an xml document

678
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
and pick it out yourself so we we do all

679
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,000
that for you yeah and again so this is

680
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
like not really a live demo um we don't

681
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
have internet right now but that's why

682
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,480
we're showing a pre-recorded s-bomb

683
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
upload yeah we're really worried about

684
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
the demo gods um we don't know if our

685
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
internet will work or not so we

686
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,919
pre-recorded that and have a local

687
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
instance for you guys

688
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,720
so what's down the line what's on the

689
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
road map um do you want to go over so

690
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
before we get into the full-on demo um

691
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
these are just our next steps for

692
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,760
daggerboard so the the next thing that

693
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
we want to integrate is vect support

694
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
this will give us the ability to reduce

695
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
false positives we have in our data

696
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
maybe for a given product it'll we can

697
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
more reliably say these different s

698
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,120
bombs contribute um

699
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
so we should mention what vex is

700
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
first off vex was a term that came out

701
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
of the working groups was a term that

702
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
came out of the working groups

703
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,440
that absolutely everybody in the working

704
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
group hated and still hate we hate this

705
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
term it's a horrible term but what it

706
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,039
stands for is vulnerability

707
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,200
exploitability exchange

708
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
and the way to think about it is it's

709
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,559
extra information that is encoded in an

710
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,760
s-bomb

711
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
and it's from the developer of the

712
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,799
product to say a couple of things i'm

713
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,240
investigating this

714
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
vulnerability

715
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,679
i've decided this product is not

716
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
affected by this vulnerability or it is

717
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,919
affected by this vulnerability and

718
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
there's some couple sub states under

719
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,120
there that lead with things like how

720
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,799
it's configured so if you can figure it

721
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,640
one way oh you plugged in ethernet into

722
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
the rj45 jack yes you're vulnerable uh

723
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,880
there's things like that that it's done

724
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,080
in there

725
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,559
very useful because there's estimates

726
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,559
from 70 to 90 percent of unknown

727
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,720
vulnerabilities can't be exploited as

728
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
instanced in a product

729
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
so vexes allow you to give you more

730
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
clarity into it but it also gets back to

731
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
a level of trust

732
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
so for me if i there's a company i think

733
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,720
is good uh phillips phillips medical

734
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
okay and i know they do good stuff i'm

735
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
gonna trust their vex

736
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,720
but if it's acme medical i almost said

737
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,159
it really almost set a real company

738
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
there so

739
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,799
and i don't have that trust in them

740
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,240
i'm not going to care what the vex says

741
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,919
i'm going to unplug that device until i

742
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,600
know what it really is so this starts to

743
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
bring trust into the whole process and

744
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
that's nothing we can encode in xml or

745
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
json that's only something that can be

746
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,000
had over years of experience with the

747
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,960
developers who are doing this so vexes

748
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
are extremely useful

749
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
it is a very much in a crawl form

750
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
as we get into walk and run in the years

751
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,480
ahead it'll be extremely productive and

752
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,760
makes s-bombs even more valuable

753
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
sorry for jumping in kit no no that was

754
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,720
really good

755
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,799
so the next feature that we want to add

756
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
to daggerboard is an api

757
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,080
right now

758
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,320
you can upload an sbom and get results

759
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
vulnerability results but

760
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,559
what we need is the ability to have

761
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
another system pull this data and say

762
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
hey what's available and this can get us

763
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,880
to our goal of integrating with asset

764
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,600
management systems um maybe ci cd

765
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
pipelines those are just a few examples

766
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
we had in mind

767
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,559
so

768
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,640
our third uh

769
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
pro or item on our roadmap map is to add

770
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
the ability to search for cves

771
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
like chris had said earlier we all know

772
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
about the log for j vulnerability from

773
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
last winter

774
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
right now within daggerboard you can

775
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,520
find an s-bomb like based on the

776
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
product's name and like based on what

777
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,000
the s-bomb is but we can't globally

778
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,840
search through all of our s-bombs that

779
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
have been uploaded

780
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,080
by for cves for packages so that's

781
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,520
something that we think would be really

782
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
helpful for the vulnerability analysis

783
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
perspective

784
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,559
and then finally

785
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
the biggest thing

786
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
a part of daggerboard was to get it open

787
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,720
source get it put on github it currently

788
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
is on github we have our link up here we

789
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
encourage you to take a look at it give

790
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,679
it a try and if you want to contribute

791
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,120
or discuss anything we're always open

792
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,840
and so this brings us to our demo

793
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,320
all right so let's kick off the

794
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
well let's get the beautiful login page

795
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,159
that we we built here um so we need the

796
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,720
icon of the so you're probably wondering

797
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
what is the dagger board

798
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,480
and it's basically used to keep the ship

799
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
afloat so and to keep your company

800
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,080
afloat

801
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
you know you need to scan and analyze

802
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
s-bombs you don't want any holes in your

803
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,320
ship

804
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
so that's what the representation of a

805
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
dagger board is

806
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,200
um so this is our login page let's log

807
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,919
in

808
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
and from we need to know from the

809
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
perspective of an analyst what they want

810
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,880
to look at so the two major uh things

811
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
here are what are the most recent

812
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
s-bombs that were uploaded in this case

813
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,960
you know and all the data here is not

814
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,080
real this is all demo data from very

815
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
old so there's no scrutiny on apache or

816
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
anything else that you see here just as

817
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,320
a disclaimer for you guys um

818
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,960
so yeah we have the last two um s1's

819
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
that were uploaded and the overall

820
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,679
uh grade for that s bomb we calculate

821
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,240
the grade um based on the vulnerability

822
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
risk that's within um

823
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,720
that we we pull from nvd national

824
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,799
vulnerability database

825
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
and along with their severities high low

826
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,480
medium high

827
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,679
in the middle section we have our

828
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,200
highlights you can see how many total

829
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,559
vulnerabilities were found within the

830
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,840
application

831
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
how many weekly the average vendor grade

832
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,840
amongst all the all the s bombs that

833
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,679
were uploaded and at the bottom we have

834
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,440
a little um

835
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
we have a of all the we have a table of

836
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,279
all the s bombs that were uploaded

837
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,880
so moving on and we actually displayed

838
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
this page during the the recorded demo

839
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
this is where you would upload an s-bomb

840
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
this takes us to our s-bom analysis page

841
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,640
so what we can do is we can search for

842
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
the s-bombs we've uploaded to go ahead

843
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,679
and take a look and again like adam said

844
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
we intentionally grabbed really old

845
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
docker containers to show pretty charts

846
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,080
and show a lot of vulnerabilities

847
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
elasticsearch probably is not

848
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,840
an s at this point this is very old um

849
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,159
but so once we've uploaded an s-bomb

850
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,399
let's look at our results we can see

851
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,799
here's the product uh we have a grade

852
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,799
here we have the total vulnerabilities

853
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
that were found an average cvss score

854
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,760
and then we've got a beautiful spider

855
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,480
chart based on the cvss vector and then

856
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,520
a total of the vulnerability severities

857
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,440
so scrolling to the bottom of the page

858
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
we can see the packages that were found

859
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,320
from the sbom file

860
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,240
and so we can see we were able to find a

861
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
cpe here and that's how we pull

862
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
vulnerability data at this point

863
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,840
now

864
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,520
this is the part that i really like

865
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,200
because i'm on the vulnerability

866
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,279
management team i can go through here

867
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,159
and

868
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,760
find more information about what

869
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
vulnerabilities are present

870
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,960
i could maybe search for something

871
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,760
that's high i can maybe search for

872
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
for a package and then most importantly

873
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,480
one way that you may go through

874
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,360
prioritizing your results is we want to

875
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,679
know if an exploit's available so we can

876
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
do that and we get an actual reference

877
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
to exploit db

878
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,600
we can sort by severity

879
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,559
and

880
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,440
then

881
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,840
finally if we want to we can export a

882
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,679
report of all the vulnerabilities that

883
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,360
were found

884
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,918
and view it beautiful csv

885
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,640
and then moving on so we have a vendor

886
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
analysis page and this is just a way to

887
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
group the s-bombs together based on the

888
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,360
creator tag so we have apache software

889
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
foundation here

890
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,799
same sort of sorting if we wanted to

891
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,640
view something else but

892
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,039
we can see here we have five total

893
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
s-bombs from apache

894
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,039
they've got low grades

895
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,480
total 80 vulnerabilities we can see a

896
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,559
table here that shows when we uploaded

897
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,960
these different s-bombs and then just

898
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
the general distribution of

899
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
vulnerabilities

900
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,760
we get a snapshot of whatever was most

901
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,320
recently uploaded so groovy was our last

902
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
s-bomb and then uh just an overview

903
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,279
these are the different s-bombs that we

904
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,519
had from apache

905
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
so now we'll move to the admin page

906
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
yeah so if you want to deploy this in

907
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,039
within your own environment or for your

908
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,159
own

909
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,080
organization uh you need to make it

910
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
easier for your admins to configure do

911
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,480
certain configurations so we gave it the

912
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,880
ability to for our back controls for

913
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
your users you don't want some people

914
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
you only want some readers to read the

915
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
data versus people who could upload the

916
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,320
data

917
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
we also have the ldap configuration so

918
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
you could sign in

919
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
easier for your org

920
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
you can manage your users we have a

921
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,559
database

922
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,399
we could basically create you can modify

923
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,640
the database if you have to and as well

924
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
as the grading you can modify the

925
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,279
grading policy so it's not just fixed so

926
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,840
based the criteria for

927
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,240
calculating grades is very subjective

928
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,799
um you might want to consider like if

929
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
there is

930
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,799
10 if there's

931
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,120
10 high vulnerabilities what does that

932
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,960
mean to your organization and you could

933
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,799
definitely configure that within the

934
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,000
environment

935
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,880
um

936
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,799
and and that's about it um that's the

937
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,200
admin portal and this is just one

938
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,760
example of what we've been moving

939
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,399
forward with on the s bomb initiative

940
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,799
and we've it's come a long way as like a

941
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,600
healthcare uh hospital and we're very

942
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,279
like proud of ourselves and you know

943
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,360
we're not really a tech giant we're a

944
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
hospital so we've come a long way with

945
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,559
buildings up and we're very happy with

946
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,880
it yeah and i guess it just shows as

947
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,440
part of the calvary track um that

948
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,159
organizations like hospitals if you have

949
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,600
the resources or you're willing to do

950
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,880
this you totally can do it yeah so yeah

951
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
please visit our github and please

952
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,480
contribute anyone and everyone's welcome

953
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,039
to contribute to healthcare as a whole

954
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,200
thank you

955
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,200
i i want to flag one really cool thing

956
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,159
about this build there are many really

957
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,360
cool things about this project but one

958
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
of them is

959
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,159
there are a lot of security tools that

960
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,000
just do one security mission but don't

961
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
think about how it fits into an

962
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,240
organization and i think the thing that

963
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,559
struck me from this demo is oh yeah you

964
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,240
we need admin tools we need to actually

965
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
understand who's going to do what this

966
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
organization figure how it fits into the

967
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
broader mission and so i think that's a

968
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,200
really cool feature

969
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
uh that as we start thinking about more

970
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,880
open source tools that we can build

971
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
instead of saying don't don't just do

972
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
the the small thing figure out how you

973
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,360
can integrate into the bigger picture

974
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,120
so i think that's an uh thank you

975
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
an interesting point too is that so when

976
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,599
we started on this the daggerboard idea

977
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
came from the healthcare aspirin proof

978
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,320
of concept uh and initially in our first

979
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
phase of daggerboard we decided okay

980
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
this is only gonna be for medical

981
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,399
devices let's keep it specific to

982
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
healthcare but then as we got to our

983
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,280
second version of the app we realized

984
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,679
okay no this applies to every industry

985
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
that works with s-bombs

986
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,040
other people are working on it too we

987
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
want daggerboards to be used by anyone

988
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
not just hospitals

989
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
yeah and just the admin configurations

990
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,639
alone i mean that was just that took a

991
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
while to build and you know to

992
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,159
understand how to map it and there's a

993
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,079
lot of configurations that we did but to

994
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,520
come at the end of this like it's

995
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,440
basically this is just a starting point

996
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,839
for this application um we're really

997
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,599
looking to build this uh further and we

998
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,960
definitely have a road map ahead for a

999
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,159
little bit

1000
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,918
one of the things i took away from that

1001
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
presentation that's really important is

1002
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
it gives you the quality idea of your

1003
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,760
vendors

1004
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,680
the people you're buying from so maybe

1005
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,920
you've got uh you know that pdf viewer

1006
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,480
you put in your program from a large pdf

1007
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
vendor who will remain unnamed but you

1008
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
all know that name starts with an a uh

1009
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,040
and you go you know these folks never

1010
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,079
give us patches they have nothing but

1011
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,880
vulnerabilities and all this the next

1012
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,000
time i'm going to create the next

1013
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,760
product maybe i'm going to go over and

1014
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,839
try some other competitors product and

1015
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,839
put that in there and so you're looking

1016
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,280
at this and you're doing continual

1017
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,040
improvement upon your product

1018
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,119
based upon not just availability and

1019
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,280
cost and form fit and function but also

1020
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,760
cyber security how good of a program did

1021
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,359
they have are they working with me are

1022
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,880
they a partner or are they part of the

1023
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,119
problem so i think a tool like that is

1024
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,800
really useful to know

1025
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,960
remember we're all in this we're there

1026
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
isn't anybody who's outside of this

1027
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
we're somewhere in the supply chain that

1028
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,480
either we're sourcing it originally or

1029
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
we're building on top of it but i do

1030
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,079
have one question for katie and adam do

1031
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
you have an s bomb for daggerboard

1032
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,760
yes we absolutely do of course yeah

1033
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,119
[Music]

1034
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,280
it's published on that repo forever it's

1035
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,800
on github yeah and that's where it

1036
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
should be

1037
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
and that brings up an interesting topic

1038
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
which is some of the people you're now

1039
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,880
seeing complain about the fact that oh

1040
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
well if we give you our s-bomb we have

1041
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,680
to

1042
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,079
hide it behind a firewall credentials

1043
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,680
and the fact that you can't just get

1044
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
access to it the proper place for s-bomb

1045
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,440
is publicly available in this case in

1046
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,000
the repo all right if you sit there and

1047
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
think that your intellectual property is

1048
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,720
going to be exposed by the third party

1049
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,800
software components that you use then

1050
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
it's not your intellectual property it

1051
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,560
belongs to the people who created the

1052
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,119
software components okay

1053
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,400
so so

1054
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,119
go ahead i want to show you the first i

1055
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
i agree that is the the awful place to

1056
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,760
do it um many of you know sunil yu an

1057
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
early leader in thinking about s-bomb

1058
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,400
and transparency uh he moved over to a

1059
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
company called uh jupiter one one of the

1060
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,200
first things he did was saying we want a

1061
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,680
public s bomb and so jupiter one.com s

1062
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
bomb is their live s bond right it's a

1063
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
cloud-based product which means

1064
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
there are very frequent builds uh but so

1065
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,480
you get the live build

1066
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,800
but i also want to zoom out a little bit

1067
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
and talk about some of the cavalry

1068
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,079
mission

1069
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,839
which is

1070
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,880
it is our job to hold people's hands

1071
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,040
and walk them down the path for better

1072
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
security we can't just say

1073
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,079
right do security now and we'll beat you

1074
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,760
right nerd harder

1075
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
we haven't seen who says that doesn't

1076
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,839
work we haven't tried that approach

1077
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,599
but i think one of the there are

1078
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,520
companies that just have very natural

1079
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,720
aversions

1080
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
to sharing

1081
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
anything right there there's no okay

1082
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
part of it is there's massive amounts of

1083
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,240
tech debt so they don't want to show

1084
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,040
that they have been shipping old stuff

1085
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,119
uh and part of it is just culture right

1086
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,800
so my lawyer says i shouldn't do this

1087
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
and i don't know or care enough i

1088
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,240
haven't talked to my customers enough

1089
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,320
customers enough to push back

1090
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,079
so

1091
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,200
one of the things that we've done is

1092
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,040
sort of try to push back on why it has

1093
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
to be secret uh there's a great myth

1094
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,960
busting document on the nti website that

1095
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,359
sort of pushes back against that but the

1096
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,079
other thing we can do is to say

1097
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
you don't want to make it public it's

1098
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,079
okay

1099
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
why don't you try to figure out

1100
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,520
what access control at scale looks like

1101
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,320
for your thousands of customers

1102
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
and and yeah just you just need to make

1103
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
sure that all your customers have access

1104
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,720
to it uh in a timely fashion and it can

1105
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
integrate into all of your customers

1106
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
security tools and by the time you sort

1107
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,960
of they start to think about how complex

1108
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,040
it's going to be to engineer

1109
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
a way to share it safely

1110
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,359
they'll realize this is just a lot

1111
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,079
easier to share directly

1112
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,560
so there are ways that we can use some

1113
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
jiu-jitsu to get people

1114
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,040
uh to be more comfortable sharing

1115
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,160
at the end of the day you're moving

1116
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,320
around xml and json files this isn't

1117
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,079
exactly rocket science

1118
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,640
uh there's lots of ways to do this there

1119
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,400
i mean obviously you could email them it

1120
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,880
doesn't scale okay nobody wants to see

1121
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,960
that you could put it on your website

1122
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,880
probably doesn't scale either it's a

1123
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
good first step you could actually set

1124
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,640
up your own servers and have those

1125
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,839
servers they're nothing but repos for

1126
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,800
s-bombs that's now getting into the

1127
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,079
place where you want to be there's

1128
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,880
commercial activities like uh archivist

1129
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,119
is one of them which one of my open

1130
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,520
seats whatever c3 whatever some of them

1131
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
that do distribution

1132
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,040
um there's even a a wasp project to

1133
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,079
establish a open api

1134
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,160
so all of these repos will have the same

1135
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
api restful api so you can just reach

1136
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,640
out and automatically with programs like

1137
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
daggerboard once you indicate i have i

1138
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,560
want to fetch this one it constantly

1139
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
fetches and updates it and brings it in

1140
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,160
and uh so it's it is definitely moving

1141
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,960
into that walk run area where this can

1142
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
start to be really really useful so

1143
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,440
we talked about where we've been we

1144
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,839
talked about where we are what's next

1145
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
where are we going with s-bombs what do

1146
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
you guys want to see what do you think

1147
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
we're going to do alan what is sisa

1148
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
going to do with s-bombs now that we're

1149
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
here uh

1150
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,440
well what so as i mentioned the current

1151
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,520
status is where we're all able to sort

1152
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
of start moving this direction

1153
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,960
the longer term vision is really

1154
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,760
integration and automation and that sort

1155
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,960
of means hey we've got to have

1156
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
interoperability those are fun

1157
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
challenges uh they're engineering

1158
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,920
challenges they're also business

1159
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
challenges uh policy challenges uh and

1160
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,599
and also massive opportunities so you

1161
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,760
know i i love that dagger board and

1162
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,640
hopefully you'll talk a little more

1163
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
about how you're gonna integrate this as

1164
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,839
an asset management because that's where

1165
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,359
we need to be going

1166
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,079
um i've talked about briefly these four

1167
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,359
work streams that cease is going to be

1168
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,680
mentioning uh the i'm going to start

1169
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,359
repeating an email address if you'd like

1170
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,720
to be involved and you're not on my

1171
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,920
mailing lists

1172
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,800
sbam

1173
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,040
sissa.dhs.gov what was that allen s-bomb

1174
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,359
at cisa.dhs.gov

1175
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,200
uh just send me a note we'll we'll sign

1176
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,359
you up for these work streams uh and

1177
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,040
then of course the other fun thing is

1178
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,000
let's start building things

1179
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
and that's kind of uh where we're

1180
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,599
winding down here at this point but i do

1181
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,680
want to point out that what we need is

1182
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,359
more open sourcing we need more

1183
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,960
community involvement

1184
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
uh we this is a call to arms all of you

1185
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,560
need to get involved producing creating

1186
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,599
tools

1187
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,160
making s-bombs making them available

1188
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,720
this is a big project it's certainly not

1189
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,240
what i thought the first day alan

1190
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,200
started this okay it is a giant tidal

1191
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
wave that we all need to get behind and

1192
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
help what do we do for the cyber poor

1193
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
who are out there how do we get them in

1194
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,119
a good place okay they need help

1195
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,079
there is a hospital that's in ohio

1196
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,400
well as a medical device manufacturer we

1197
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,000
always refer to hdos health delivery

1198
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,920
organizations like it's this monolithic

1199
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,359
thing they're all the same

1200
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,680
like they're all mayo clinic or new york

1201
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
presbyterian or or an organization

1202
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,839
that's large and doing things correctly

1203
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,280
they're not they're a spectrum so they

1204
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,680
go from that far extreme to this

1205
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,079
hospital in ohio where the same guy who

1206
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,440
mows their lawn sets up their network

1207
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,760
i'm not kidding this is the case and

1208
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
everything in between how do we help

1209
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
those people all of them they all matter

1210
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,920
especially those little guys they don't

1211
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
have the resources the knowledge the

1212
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,599
funding to do this

1213
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,000
it's all incumbent upon us to put these

1214
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,079
tools out there get the information in

1215
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,079
front of them lower the bar so they can

1216
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,599
adopt this stuff

1217
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,880
think about this it's your

1218
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
responsibility

1219
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,040
these gentlemen started the ball rolling

1220
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
the rest of us are just rolling along

1221
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,000
with them and i'm including all of you

1222
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,720
in that as well too

1223
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
last words alan uber last i'm going to

1224
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,119
start with you first

1225
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,160
s bomb sissa.dhs.gov

1226
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,960
uh i don't have anything to promote

1227
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,839
besides check out our github but um just

1228
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,160
to touch on what chris said yeah i

1229
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,480
actually used to work for a hospital in

1230
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,040
kansas and we would buy a lot of those

1231
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,119
small hospitals from rural kansas that

1232
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,640
were tiny and

1233
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,319
the first things that would happen after

1234
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,640
you bought these hospitals was they got

1235
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,560
hit with ransomware man what do we do

1236
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,119
now because no one can do anything and

1237
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:13,920
so

1238
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
um they didn't really have much i.t

1239
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,839
there and this is where s-bomb really

1240
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,599
helps us let's let's get s-bomb out

1241
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,960
there let's find out what's in these

1242
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,800
environments let's help these smaller

1243
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,839
hospitals figure this

1244
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,119
out adam yeah

1245
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,800
uh i i guess just contribute um

1246
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
contribute uh right now you know we have

1247
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,119
our day jobs and now that we've deployed

1248
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,839
something on on github as open source we

1249
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,160
have outsiders telling us to hey can you

1250
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
fix this can you fix that but we have

1251
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,319
our day jobs we also need to you know

1252
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,680
work for the you know at new york

1253
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,399
presbyterian um so please help us out

1254
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,119
this is matters this is important we

1255
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,960
don't have any other way to do this when

1256
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,640
you look at those black boxes you don't

1257
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,960
know what's in them nobody does

1258
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,560
even the experts like myself i'd have to

1259
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,640
tear it apart and spend weeks on that

1260
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,400
one version to find out what's really in

1261
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,880
there a lot of work a lot of effort we

1262
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,359
need to lower the bar on this we have a

1263
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,400
huge installed base of really crappy

1264
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,960
products out there

1265
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,319
in the medical device industry we

1266
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,160
specialize in that we've got hospitals

1267
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,720
that have 30 year old components in it

1268
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,599
all right

1269
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
30 year old components how secure do you

1270
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,599
think those really are

1271
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,040
they're not

1272
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
we're looking at all of you think about

1273
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,440
this this matters this could save lives

1274
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,319
this will save lives as we go forward so

1275
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,480
whatever industry you're in make certain

1276
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
you're looking at this ask your vendors

1277
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,880
for s-bombs whatever you're writing even

1278
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,560
if it's a diary app that you're going to

1279
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,680
release you know out to the app store

1280
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,200
ask your vendors that you're using

1281
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,839
where's your s-bomb ask this keep that

1282
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,160
ball rolling keep it going i want to

1283
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,680
thank all of you for the gift of your

1284
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,000
time here today to listen to us

1285
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,520
and we hope to see you in our meetings

1286
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,119
so obviously this is super valuable

1287
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,400
especially for the target rich cyber

1288
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,079
poor we discussed yesterday they may not

1289
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,760
be able to buy new things or hire new

1290
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,680
people but they can at least know what

1291
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,079
they're getting in these

1292
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,640
obsolete or older technologies and know

1293
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,720
am i affected where am i affected when

1294
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,640
the next log which they happen the bad

1295
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,079
news on some of these hospitals is now

1296
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,839
seven eight months later

1297
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:26,800
some of them still don't have a

1298
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,760
commitment

1299
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
on what's in the software when are they

1300
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,200
getting a patch so we're on a journey

1301
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,040
we're crawl walk running but this wasn't

1302
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,400
merely about s-bomb and the great work

1303
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,599
here i just want to

1304
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
look at these two developers

1305
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,359
and the attitudes we keep hearing from

1306
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,960
thought leaders in cyber security that s

1307
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
bomb's too hard no one can do it no one

1308
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,200
can make use of it they say screw it

1309
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,040
let's just build something

1310
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,359
and part of this was a meta hint that i

1311
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,720
wonder if part of the next phase of the

1312
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,560
cavalry is we start teaming up with

1313
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
software developers open source

1314
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,560
contributors and that this is just one

1315
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,640
of maybe dozens of projects that could

1316
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,240
help waste water treatment could help

1317
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,760
oil and gas could help the target rich

1318
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,160
cyber poor and the food supply

1319
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
and i kind of like their attitudes i

1320
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,920
kind of like the contribution and i kind

1321
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,680
of like the idea that instead of just

1322
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,280
just pointing out problems we might be

1323
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,720
able to create the tool chains that the

1324
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
private center is not yet willing to do

1325
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
this is a hint and a nudge

1326
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,720
not just to take s-bombs and maybe put

1327
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,319
the known exploited vulnerabilities list

1328
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,599
in it so they can target more

1329
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,960
specifically

1330
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
but also what tools could you ask for

1331
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,880
build or contribute to and advocate for

1332
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
so this is a hint maybe for the future

1333
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,480
of the cavalry

1334
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,160
we're going to be outside if you want to

1335
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
talk with us after this presentation if

1336
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,760
you've got any other questions

1337
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,359
right now if you don't want a voice in

1338
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,520
public right now it's a q a period

1339
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,520
questions

1340
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,319
we don't have any portable mics

1341
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,560
i haven't i haven't been on the

1342
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
discussion list so

1343
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,240
have you been thinking about and i'm

1344
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
already well familiar with s problems

1345
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,839
josh may not recognize me but he'll know

1346
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,960
me in a minute

1347
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,640
um

1348
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,760
have you thought about when you're

1349
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
talking about cloud transparency other

1350
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,359
aspects that aren't just software

1351
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,560
components

1352
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,359
like

1353
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,839
does the software do sso integration you

1354
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,440
know does it support saml does it

1355
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,160
support oauth whatever

1356
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
do you do things like validating email

1357
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,559
addresses before subscribing people all

1358
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,400
that kind of behavioral stuff that's

1359
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,680
another level

1360
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,000
of operational information

1361
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,680
separate from what are the software

1362
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,599
components you use

1363
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,760
and i think it kind of like you said

1364
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,480
about tying it into

1365
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,079
configuration management asset

1366
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,000
management tying it into information

1367
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
security policies at the organization

1368
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,160
that's building the software

1369
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,920
as a cso type role i get asked by people

1370
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,720
about the practices in our organization

1371
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
and everybody sends me a one-off

1372
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,040
questionnaire with 150 questions there's

1373
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,640
no standard for

1374
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,800
and i'd love to have a standard form

1375
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,280
that's s-bomb-like to give them

1376
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,240
to say

1377
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,920
here's the change management control

1378
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,319
practices we follow here's the software

1379
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,839
development lifecycle practices we

1380
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,760
follow et cetera et cetera

1381
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,280
so when you're buying this product from

1382
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,200
us this is what you're getting

1383
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
you want to chime in on the

1384
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,160
questionnaire

1385
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,319
they touched on one of my subjects okay

1386
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
this year the health sector coordinating

1387
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,839
council released the model contract

1388
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,839
language mc squared 45 terms for

1389
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,920
hospitals to use in contracting with

1390
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,160
medical device suppliers

1391
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,440
and it talks all about the different

1392
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,920
cyber security expectations the most

1393
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,079
dysfunctional relationship ever is

1394
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,280
hospitals to medical device

1395
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
manufacturers always has been i've been

1396
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,599
doing this 50 years it's been horrible

1397
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,680
i'm trying to make it better i know a

1398
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,440
lot of other people are too

1399
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,200
it's kind of our goal we're starting

1400
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,119
with cyber security

1401
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,720
but this goes into a lot of different

1402
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,800
places so how do you do this so when you

1403
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
get those questionnaires

1404
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,480
mds squared of course obviously you're

1405
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,640
going to be filling that out obviously

1406
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,960
but the custom ones we're trying to

1407
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,400
minimize

1408
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
if we can get them to align to things

1409
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,400
like this mc squared that will be a much

1410
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,319
quicker way to answer much less burden

1411
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,920
on the manufacturer in a much better

1412
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,160
position we'll all be in

1413
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,480
so on the idea of enhancing small i

1414
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,920
haven't seen a lot of discussion around

1415
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,599
specific security features although

1416
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,680
measurement of security features is one

1417
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,160
of my key passions which is how do i

1418
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
sort of quickly and cheaply determine

1419
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,680
security features

1420
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,599
where we are seeing a lot of attention

1421
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,760
especially from the cloud native world

1422
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,000
is saying in addition to my dependencies

1423
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,880
let me document my broader security

1424
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,800
process so let me have um right secure

1425
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,280
robust attestations of what compiler i

1426
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,839
used what my build chain was where i

1427
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:46,720
actually got the source from uh and

1428
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,640
having each of those artifacts signed

1429
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,240
along the way

1430
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,160
the challenge is how do i meet how do we

1431
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,119
put enough semantic value into that data

1432
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,640
so that we can enforce it at policy

1433
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,680
level otherwise it just turns into right

1434
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,839
a paperwork exercise what we want to do

1435
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,599
and there are organizations including

1436
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,079
solarwinds today which is sort of saying

1437
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,079
here's the policy and we're not going to

1438
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,280
let code go to uh go live until it's

1439
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,119
checked all these boxes

1440
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,280
and one thing that the two major formats

1441
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,160
that we've influenced in ntia

1442
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,760
are cyclone dx and spdx

1443
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,520
they are both in motion

1444
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,280
and generally if one does something good

1445
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,559
the other one does something good and

1446
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,160
copies it i'd

1447
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,760
argue that you go out i'm not going to

1448
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,119
tell you which one's better i have my

1449
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,440
opinions let you find your own

1450
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
but cyclone dx does have some of the

1451
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,800
stuff you're talking about in separate

1452
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,160
artifacts

1453
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,400
hopefully spdx will answer that and

1454
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,000
everybody will keep motion and we'll and

1455
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,640
we'll have ways to uh rosetta stone all

1456
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,240
that information together because that's

1457
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,079
where we need to be i think we've just

1458
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,880
got two minutes

1459
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,359
i'll be quick i have a really basic kind

1460
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,680
of s-bomb question i guess within policy

1461
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,280
is there anything in the executive order

1462
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,280
or anywhere else that kind of uh

1463
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,720
mandates

1464
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,319
uh the existence of s-bombs for

1465
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,559
federally funded software or products or

1466
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,920
that sort of thing that exists right now

1467
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,960
where that's gonna be coming down the

1468
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,040
line legacy thank you yeah or well we're

1469
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,119
going forward either way so the

1470
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,240
executive order 14028 from 2021 uh

1471
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,520
mandates that everything the us

1472
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,040
government buys will ultimately have to

1473
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,800
have an s bomb that's going the

1474
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,559
mechanism is first it's going to be a

1475
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,319
memo from omb that's going to come out

1476
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,240
soon uh and ultimately is going to be

1477
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,480
part of the federal acquisition rules uh

1478
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,440
there's also some language in the draft

1479
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,720
ndaa

1480
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,319
uh the national defense authorization

1481
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,480
act uh that is going to apply to a

1482
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,559
couple different parts including a dod

1483
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,720

1489
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,480
that says not only is all the cyber

1490
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,160
security work needs to be done for

1491
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,920
release of the product and that includes

1492
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,319
s-bomb but also all the existing legacy

1493
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,319

1494
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,079

great thanks

1498
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,960
um is it a reasonable step for medical

1499
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,200
device manufacturers to just put that in

1500
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,559
the mds2s like the s-bom details kind of

1501
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,359
as a as a baby step to having more of a

1502
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,280
live stream there are questions in the

1503
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,440
mds2 about if you have an sbom and all

1504
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,079
that it's not a great place to do it uh

1505
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,839
it's not in a format that's easily

1506
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,760
machine readable so let's say i've got

1507
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,319
javascript is the basis of my device in

1508
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,359
some way phone i may have two three four

1509
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,119
ten thousand

1510
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,559
references

1511
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,240
doesn't really work in that you wanna

1512
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,920
stick to one of the markup languages

1513
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,800
json or xml that can be easily sourced

1514
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,720
consumed we're out of the days of

1515
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,800
emailing and texting each other to each

1516
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,960
other if i have to open up excel to pull

1517
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
something out of it ain't gonna happen

1518
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,000
right not gonna be scalable so

1519
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,599
flag that you've got one

1520
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,280
even point to the url where it can be

1521
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,800
fetched but

1522
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,800

1523
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,280
