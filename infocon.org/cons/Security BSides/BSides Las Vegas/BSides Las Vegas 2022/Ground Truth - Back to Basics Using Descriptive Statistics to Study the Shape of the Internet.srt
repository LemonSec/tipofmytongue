1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
we are ready for our next talk

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,520
it is back to basics using descriptive

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,200
statistics to study the shape of the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
internet please welcome emily austin

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,760
from census

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
all right hey everyone um thank you all

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,560
so much for uh coming here

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,000
uh

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,800
to

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
check out my talk this afternoon i

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
really appreciate it i know you had lots

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,320
of options for things to do um but you

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,399
chose to be here and i appreciate that

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,760
um also

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
shout out to the it and like

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
coordination folks for getting me hooked

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
up with a with a plug-in like in record

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
speed that was like the fastest it

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,280
assistance i think i've ever had so

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
thank you very much

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
but um with that said i'm gonna go ahead

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,879
and get started a lot to cover hopefully

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,960
we'll get through it all in time for the

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,559
the meetup

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,559
uh so yeah we're gonna be talking about

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,480
using descriptive statistics

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,078
to study the shape of the internet today

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
so i'm emily i am currently a research

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
scientist at census

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,200
and

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
i

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
study all kinds of things on the

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,280
internet i'm particularly interested in

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,080
um

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
things that have to do with security or

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
security adjacent but the internet at

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
large is kind of within within the scope

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,200
of things that we look at

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
prior to coming to census i was a

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,119
security engineer and a researcher for

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
about six years

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
and was really focused on kind of the

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
blue team side of things so detection

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,439
response lots of incident response

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,240
um

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
really focused on those types of things

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
and then i got my start in tech actually

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,479
as an analyst on a data science team

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
where i worked really closely with folks

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,680
in

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,240
marketing and product and ux to better

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
understand how folks were using our

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
product at my company and this also

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
included people who were doing unusual

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,399
things with our product which

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
is really anomaly detection when you get

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
right down to it so it was doing it even

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,559
then and didn't realize it

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,880
here's a little bit of an outline of

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,360
what we'll be talking about today um so

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,199
i'm going to start by talking a little

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,038
bit about census data

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
no good analysis can can begin without

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
understanding your data and so we'll

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
talk a little bit about that and then

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
we'll talk a little bit about some

67
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
descriptive statistical methods that

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
will that will be useful in your

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
exploratory data analysis adventures

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
then we'll move into talking about the

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
internet as a whole

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
so this talk is actually secretly really

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,440
the story of my getting acquainted with

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
census data when i first joined census

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
as a scientist and so i started really

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
broadly looking at the internet as a

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
whole

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
and then we'll get into looking at

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
census visible risks and vulnerabilities

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
on the internet like you can't come to

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,280
b-sides and not talk about some really

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
cool risks and vulnerabilities so we'll

83
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,519
be doing that and then

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,080
what is probably my favorite section is

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
looking at the internet's response to

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
major vulnerabilities so we'll look at

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
three high-profile vulnerabilities that

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
came out over the last year and a half

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
and we'll look at how the internet

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
responded to each of them and they're

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
actually quite different and i think

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
it's very interesting and raising some

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
interesting questions about how we as a

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,720
security community can get better about

95
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,800
patching and upgrading and fixing these

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
things when they happen

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,840
and then we'll get into what i'm going

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
to call the long tail so the long tail

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
of any distribution often has very

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
interesting things in it um you can find

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
anomalous things weird interesting

102
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,480
things so we'll talk about a few things

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
there

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
so let's start as i said by by talking

105
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
about our data

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
so census for those of you who aren't

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
familiar we actually have two products

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
um one is our data product which i'll be

109
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
talking about primarily today

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
but we also have an attack surface

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
management platform

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,319
so this platform if you give us

113
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,879
a range of ip addresses or a domain

114
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,439
we can take that and use our attribution

115
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,400
algorithm

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
and look at all of this internet wide

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
scan data that we have and identify

118
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
things that we think you own on the

119
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,599
internet

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
and what we'll do with that in addition

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
to reporting that to you will also

122
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,400
identify

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
any risks that we're able to see on

124
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
those assets that we think you own

125
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
and that'll come into play a little bit

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,600
later

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
but for now let's just focus on the scan

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
data itself

129
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
so census scans the entire ipv4 space

130
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
and you can see kind of the breakdown of

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,320
how we do that and how we prioritize

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
different ports here

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
and this data is available at

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,600
search.census.io

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
if you go there in your browser and this

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
is also in a

137
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,479
data set

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
so that's primarily what i'll be talking

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
about what i'll be using today for

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
analysis purposes

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
so this is this is a very truncated

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
example of the the bigquery schema for

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,080
our internet-wide data set

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,120
um so you can see uh host identifier and

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
services there are two of the top level

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
fields in our data here we have 11 of

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
those and those actually expand into

148
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
over 1100 fields in our data

149
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
so as you can imagine lots and lots of

150
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,639
um

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
interesting things to look at lots of

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,000
sparsity in there as well because we

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
collect different metadata about

154
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,280
different services so poses some

155
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,520
interesting questions when trying to

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
efficiently query that data

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
this is just a sample of what that data

158
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
looks like um so this this sample

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,759
actually isn't particularly interesting

160
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
in and of itself but you can see we can

161
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
you can query the data and get these

162
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,039
types of things back

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
so we talked a little bit about the data

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
let's talk about

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
methods for a moment

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,639
so

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,800
i am i am going to stand on a soapbox

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,759
for a moment if you'll allow me um

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
so over the last few years

170
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
there's been a huge embrace in the

171
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
security community of

172
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
data science and machine learning and ai

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,759
and it's amazing quite frankly it's

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
actually one of the things that got me

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
into security the fact that these types

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
of methods lend themselves really well

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,759
to security types of problems so malware

178
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
classification um bot detection these

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
problems are all like there's so many

180
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
interesting ways to apply uh data

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
science machine learning to security

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
problems

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
but a fundamental building block that i

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
don't think we talk about enough quite

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
frankly um is the underlying exploratory

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
data analysis and kind of all of the

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
work that prep that has to go into

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,759
building some of these amazing models

189
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,840
and getting them deployed and not to

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
take away from any of that all of that

191
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
is really really incredible but

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
much in the same way that we think about

193
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,360
you know you've probably heard people

194
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
say well social media is like seeing

195
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
everyone else's highlight real but you

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
have your highlights and your behind the

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
scenes

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
i feel like we need to talk more about

199
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,800
the the behind the scenes of machine

200
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
learning and ai a little bit and so

201
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
that's what i'll be talking about today

202
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
i'm going to get off my soapbox uh

203
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
but i think it's equally important and

204
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
quite frankly i think it's cool as well

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,759
so we'll start here um very simply um

206
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
for those of you familiar with python

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
pandas you will recognize this but

208
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
in this case df is my data frame or data

209
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
set and these are some operators that i

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
can call on my data frame to get sets of

211
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
descriptive statistics about my data

212
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
describe will give me things like

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
min max standard deviation mean and then

214
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
mode and median as well so pretty simple

215
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
these types of things these values

216
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,400
allow us to understand the shape of our

217
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
data much in the way that you you can

218
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,240
see here um so we can understand

219
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,479
if our data is skewed a bit if if we

220
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,360
have

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
right or left etc um so if we know these

222
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
things if we have these measures of

223
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,160
central tendency we should be good right

224
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
like we've described our data set and

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
we're good to go on

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,919
right

227
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,400
so

228
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
let's do a little thought experiment

229
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
so imagine i give you four data sets

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,879
um

231
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,840
and they all have the same summary

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
statistics each of the data sets has an

233
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,400
x and a y column and there are 11

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,879
observations or rows in each of these

235
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
data sets

236
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,919
and

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
column x of each of these have the same

238
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
mean column y also have the same mean

239
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
and if you were to fit a linear

240
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
regression to these they would also have

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,479
the same regression line

242
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,279
so

243
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
they're functionally the same right like

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
i could probably treat these data sets

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,680
as equivalent

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
where are the data sets

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
and so i don't know if you're like me

248
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
this is a little bit hard to to chew

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,839
through um

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
the one thing that i guess stands out to

251
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,080
me about this is the uh column x in the

252
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
data set four i mean it's it's all

253
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,240
eights primarily but otherwise it's

254
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
really hard to tease apart what's going

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
on in each of these data sets or at

256
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
least it is for me if it's not for you i

257
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,040
salute you and i would love to know your

258
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
tricks and secrets um but for me it's a

259
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
little bit hard to parse this

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
so what we should do is why don't we

261
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
plot them and see what happens

262
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,279
so this is what happens

263
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
um you can see in the left two charts

264
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
these both seem to be linear models um

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
the one on the bottom left probably

266
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,440
could be fit a little bit better but

267
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
then the two charts on the right are

268
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,720
arguably not linear at all and probably

269
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
are they're very very different from one

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
another and from the other two

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
and so this is a famous data set known

272
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
as anscombe's quartet um it was created

273
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,839
in the 70s by a statistician who wanted

274
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
to really emphasize the importance of

275
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
not only describing your data through

276
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,480
summary statistics but also um through

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,640
visualizing it as well

278
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,760
and so

279
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
i mentioned this because most of what

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
i'll show you in this presentation will

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
be things like bar graphs area charts

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
there'll be some packed bubble plots as

283
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
well

284
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,600
and

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
these are all things that have helped me

286
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
understand this data a little bit better

287
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
and so i share this with you to say that

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
it's really important to visualize your

289
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,079
data it doesn't have to be beautiful it

290
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,920
doesn't have to be fancy but it can be

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
very functional and also very helpful

292
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,680
so before we move on to actually talking

293
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
about the data i want to leave you with

294
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,839
this this quote from john tukey he's a

295
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
famous statistician from the early part

296
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
of the 20th century

297
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,079
and he says exploratory data analysis is

298
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,600
an attitude it's a state of flexibility

299
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,399
and i love this quote because it just

300
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
kind of screams like just go with the

301
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
flow like follow the rabbit holes look

302
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
at the interesting threads in data and

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
just follow them

304
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
and i think it's no coincidence that

305
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,880
many of the best analysts and

306
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
researchers i've known are actually

307
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
quite creative

308
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,040
and so i would say keep this in mind

309
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
exploratory data analysis can can often

310
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
be very creative and very fun if you're

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
willing to kind of dig a little bit and

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,240
follow those threads

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
so

314
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,279
now let's talk about the internet as a

315
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
whole

316
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
hop in your time machine for a moment

317
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,880
and come back with me to 1969

318
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,279
when the precursor to our modern

319
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,800
internet was

320
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
the new hot thing

321
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
the arpanet with its four nodes

322
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,600
connecting several research institutions

323
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
um so it's kind of nice to remember

324
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,000
these sort of humble beginnings i think

325
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,880
and then

326
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
fast forward 30 years

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,519
to 1999

328
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,920
and this is from uh the internet mapping

329
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,480
project and it's showing um

330
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
relationships between some of the major

331
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
isps and you can see that even within 30

332
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,760
years there's been like from 1969 to 99

333
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
there's a tremendous amount of growth

334
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
and change on the internet

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
there's actually um a paper i found from

336
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680
the late 2000s that suggests that um

337
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
the internet the internet's growth

338
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
actually follows moore's law and will

339
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
double in size every approximately like

340
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,000
five years or so

341
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
and this is in relation to like

342
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
autonomous system connections so kind of

343
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
mind-boggling if you think about that

344
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,079
um

345
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,880
so

346
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
we can look at the internet now

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
um

348
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,519
this is a look at different hosts or

349
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
essentially ip addresses by city in the

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,800
u.s um and these the the hotter regions

351
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,320
here represent like hundreds of ip

352
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
addresses

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
um so we've come a long way from those

354
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
four nodes on the west coast where i

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
guess we're technically in the west

356
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,639
right now but we've come a long way from

357
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,120
those four nodes and uh i think that's

358
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
pretty cool like that's really

359
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
interesting and so now i think it makes

360
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
a lot of sense to to look at well what's

361
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,760
on the internet right

362
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
so i won't show code for every one of

363
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,839
these examples but i do want to orient

364
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,120
you just a bit to what i what i'm

365
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
looking at and what i started by what i

366
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
started looking at um again this is

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
python pandas in a jupiter notebook um

368
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
just reading in a csv

369
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,959
and you can see here on the bottom like

370
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
the different uh fields that i'm looking

371
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
at so this is a data set of um

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,079
service name port and service count over

373
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
a series of dates from june of 2021

374
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,399
through may of 2022

375
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
with uh several different snapshot dates

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
in there

377
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
so if we look at the number of services

378
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
that we actually have in this data it's

379
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
quite a lot i mean well a lot is

380
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,000
relative i suppose when you're talking

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,199
about the internet this is really not a

382
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
lot in terms of the internet but 106 is

383
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,720
a lot to start with so i wanted to just

384
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
kind of look at maybe the top 20 and

385
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
start there because again i'm new to

386
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
internet measurement research uh as of

387
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
this year and so i really had no idea

388
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,760
what to expect so i was like i'm gonna

389
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
buy it off just a little bit of this and

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
get started

391
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
so

392
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,760
here we can put this data into a cross

393
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
tab and essentially compute

394
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,920
percentages for each of these dates that

395
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,639
are columns we can compute

396
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,320
what percentage

397
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,079
each service represents for each of

398
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
these dates

399
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,279
and then we can plot it because quite

400
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,519
frankly this is a little hard to to make

401
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
sense of

402
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,560
so here's what we get

403
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
um and i'd like to direct your attention

404
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
to the fact that this is not actually a

405
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,600
bar chart

406
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
this is a time series heat map

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
so

408
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,519
as you can see http is really really

409
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,639
dominant um in fact it's 81 of the

410
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,639
services that we see on the internet or

411
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
did during this time period so it's a

412
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
lot

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
um but the thing with this so

414
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,120
this is like a whole this http is a

415
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
whole order of magnitude larger than

416
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
anything else that we're seeing

417
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
so i want to kind of dig a little bit

418
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
deeper because i can kind of make out

419
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,560
some different uh different variations

420
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,000
of color here but it's really hard to

421
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,279
pick apart

422
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,320
um

423
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
so if i take out http here's what i get

424
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,680
so now we're kind of dealing with things

425
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,279
that are a little bit more on the same

426
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
order of magnitude

427
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
and this is from snapshots uh of about

428
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
220 million services for our 220 million

429
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,240
hosts excuse me for each of these dates

430
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
um so you can start to see ssh

431
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,440
smtp ftp these are these are pretty

432
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
popular services that we see a lot of on

433
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
the internet um but just for relative

434
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
comparison's sake uh http i mentioned is

435
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,839
about 81 of the services on the internet

436
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,399
ssh is three percent uh at least in this

437
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
data that we saw so to give you an idea

438
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,800
of kind of uh scale and proportion

439
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
but let's go back to http for just a

440
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,920
moment

441
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
um because any time you're dealing with

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
a data set that is so like has such a

443
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,880
tremendous like chunk of things that are

444
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
all one flavor it's probably a good idea

445
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
to parse them apart into uh finer

446
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,880
details right

447
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
and so this is just a dashboard that i

448
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,320
put together when i was exploring this

449
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
data to better understand http kind of

450
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,440
on the internet um so

451
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
this this map here in the top left

452
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
represents where http services run just

453
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
by counts um you can see that the us

454
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
obviously have a ton

455
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,639
china and germany actually it's a little

456
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,079
hard to make out with the magnitude of

457
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,759
the us but also

458
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,759
quite quite popular there

459
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,920
uh in the top right is just distribution

460
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,959
of ports where we see http run

461
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
and then on this bottom row

462
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279
in the far left corner we actually

463
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,759
joined up our internet wide scan data

464
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
with a data set called asdb

465
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
it's a project out of stanford

466
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,279
university and it categorizes autonomous

467
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
systems into different industry buckets

468
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
um which makes it a little easier to

469
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,839
kind of compare things over time and

470
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,920
also to each other

471
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
and then in the the middle and bottom

472
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,560
right of these corners are well of this

473
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,519
row

474
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,880
you can see some of the different

475
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,959
vendors and products that we see

476
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,280
so yes um http is web servers websites

477
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
um but there's also things like proxies

478
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
and caches um

479
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,799
load balancers apis so http lots and

480
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,720
lots of different things run on http

481
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,359
i hesitated with whether to share this

482
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
set of graphs

483
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
but because it doesn't actually show

484
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
anything quantitatively it doesn't tell

485
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,640
you anything quantitatively about these

486
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
different services

487
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,840
but

488
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,679
so just to orient you here so for each

489
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,520
of these um for instance we'll look at

490
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,919
ssh this large bubble represents the

491
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
proportion of ssh services that we see

492
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
on port 22.

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
you can see 22.22

494
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,200
much smaller but still larger in size

495
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
than a lot of these others

496
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,799
so it's it's the proportion of services

497
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
running on a given port

498
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
and i say i hesitated to show this but i

499
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
realized when i was going through and

500
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,200
kind of doing this first pass analysis

501
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,000
this visual actually really helped me

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,559
initially to understand kind of the way

503
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,000
some of these top services are

504
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,919
distributed on the internet

505
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,440
so http

506
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,840
kind of runs everywhere

507
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,039
in fact of the 65 535 ports we see in in

508
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
this particular snapshot of data from

509
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,160
march 15 we saw it on uh 65

510
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,080
532 i think so it's quite literally

511
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
everywhere and i'm sure had i picked a

512
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
different day those other two ports

513
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,160
would have also been represented

514
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
but you contrast that with ssh and ftp

515
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,760
and you can see that they are much more

516
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,000
commonly run on their iana assigned or

517
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
signed port

518
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
and then smtp smtp is kind of a whole

519
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
other thing too because of like secure

520
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,840
smtp deprecation reports and that kind

521
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,799
of thing

522
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
but either way i think again this kind

523
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
of speaks to the power of visuals i

524
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,400
think

525
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
so

526
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,480
27 million ssh instances

527
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,720
75 of them run on their assigned port

528
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,320
um and this is just from one snapshot

529
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,160
date by the way so this is one date that

530
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
we see this many ssh services

531
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
so kind of digging into this i was like

532
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
well

533
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
maybe it makes sense to look at ssh

534
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
versions because that's that seems like

535
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
an interesting thing to look at

536
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,960
and

537
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
you can see open ssh obviously really

538
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,039
popular but if you'll notice down here

539
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
so this

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
this data is at the open or at the

541
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
software level so each row represents a

542
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,039
different software version

543
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,200
uh with the total number of observations

544
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,000
of it that we see in the right column

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
and if you see the bottom of the slide

546
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,840
we apparently see 179 000 different

547
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
flavors of ssh

548
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,919
which again i'm not an internet

549
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,000
measurement expert and certainly was not

550
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,480
at the time but that seems a little

551
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,919
weird to me

552
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
um so remember that we'll look at that a

553
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,000
little later

554
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,919
for now we'll look at the most common

555
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
ssh versions again trusty bar plot like

556
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
who doesn't love them um so i'll point

557
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
out that this graph is also log scaled

558
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,799
um

559
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
but you can see like open ssh is really

560
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
popular this is probably not surprising

561
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
to most folks in the room um

562
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,039
and i think kind of

563
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,159
uh

564
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,240
the good news is like these are these

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,320
are mostly newer versions right um

566
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,600
it does it's not until you get to like

567
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,520
down here where you see open ssh like

568
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,039
six something i think those were

569
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
released in 2014 which may be a little

570
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
older um but you know not too bad

571
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
overall

572
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,840
so let's look at ssh ciphers

573
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,760
next um

574
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,000
and this to orient this is actually out

575
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
of percentage of total instances so

576
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,159
most of these um 75 of these actually

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
are either an aes algorithm or a

578
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
poly1305

579
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
however

580
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
um as of march 15th when this this

581
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
particular data was was collected

582
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
we see a whole lot of triple des still

583
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
out there um which is a little bit

584
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
interesting because that was deprecated

585
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
i think or suggested to be deprecated in

586
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
2017

587
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
i think

588
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,240
um and that's like 10 million services

589
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
that are still running that and you can

590
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
also see some blowfish over here which

591
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,080
again has been deprecated in favor of

592
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
two fish i think um so

593
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,840
overall like 75 of these are pretty good

594
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,360
but like we could be we could be doing

595
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
better with these these millions of

596
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,430
services

597
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,200
[Music]

598
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
so let's shift a bit to looking at ftp

599
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
talked about ssh we kind of you know

600
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
grazed the surface but that's okay this

601
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
is exploration um

602
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
91

603
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
of ftp that we see

604
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
is on port 21.

605
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
however

606
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
when i was looking at this for the first

607
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,520
time

608
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,159
i realized that about three percent so

609
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,919
the next most common port that we see

610
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
ftp running on uh is 4029

611
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,919
and i thought well you know being again

612
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,200
new to internet measurement maybe this

613
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
is just some obscure service that i

614
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
don't i don't know about like this is

615
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
probably just a thing right

616
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
so i went to census search and i do this

617
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
a lot where like i'll be querying data

618
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
in a sql database and then i'll kind of

619
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
pop over here to just sort of dig and

620
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
poke at things via a ui

621
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,799
and i looked for

622
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,559
ftp services running on port 4029

623
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,520
the thing that immediately stood out to

624
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
me is that almost all of these are on an

625
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,080
alibaba cloud autonomous system

626
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,120
um

627
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,440
which i don't really

628
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,880
i'm not really entirely sure what's

629
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
going on there in fact if anyone here

630
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,840
knows or has some theory on what that

631
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,280
might be i would love to talk to you

632
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,120
afterwards because this has puzzled me

633
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
for a while um and i even i looked i i

634
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,640
kept digging and so like port rangers

635
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,440
used my microsoft i did notice that

636
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
anecdotally a number of those ftp

637
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
services did seem to be i think a

638
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,039
microsoft flavor of ftp if i remember

639
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
correctly but still really odd and i'm

640
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,960
just really curious if anyone has any

641
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
thoughts about that i would love to talk

642
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
to you afterwards because that's kind of

643
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,240
strange

644
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,520
okay

645
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
so

646
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
we've talked about

647
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,159
um

648
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
services on the internet

649
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,159
let's talk a little bit about where they

650
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,440
run

651
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
this tweet lives rent-free in my head i

652
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
think about it a lot and i find it

653
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
really funny

654
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
because there's a lot of truth to it but

655
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
also there's a lot of nuance that makes

656
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,279
it not so true so let's look at that

657
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,640
so this is a graph of hosts and services

658
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,960
by autonomous system this is top 20 or

659
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,240
25

660
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,120
and

661
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
uh it's sorted by hosts and you can see

662
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
you know amazon is at the top and i'll

663
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,520
point out this is just one of amazon's

664
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
autonomous systems there's another one

665
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
somewhere down here um and there are

666
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,799
others as well these are these are not

667
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,400
all of amazon's autonomous systems

668
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,679
there's lots of them

669
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,840
um but then we can also look at this

670
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,320
sorted by services so instead of just

671
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
looking at in this case host being like

672
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,799
an ip address we can look at services so

673
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,679
services would be like ssh ftp etc

674
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
amazon is still

675
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
at the top

676
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,919
this particular as but you do see a

677
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,440
little bit of shuffling right so like

678
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
ovh and you see some other cloud

679
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,559
providers like i think digitalocean

680
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
appears down here you can kind of start

681
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
to see that and how some of these cloud

682
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
providers do tend to run lots of

683
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,640
services on the internet

684
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
um but one thing i'll point out is in

685
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
looking at um

686
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
amazon google

687
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
microsoft cloud and i think

688
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
i believe oracle as well

689
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,919
um only about nine percent of things on

690
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,799
the internet nine not ninety nine

691
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
run in one of those clouds

692
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,919
and so

693
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
there's this idea you know going back to

694
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,200
the whole thought of like the internet

695
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,720
is decent the web's decentralized and

696
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,559
then usc one goes down and everyone's

697
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,000
losing their minds and it's trending on

698
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
twitter and oh my god the world is

699
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,880
ending

700
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,840
but

701
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
i think it has a lot to do with the fact

702
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
that it's popular things things that are

703
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
integral to our everyday lives that are

704
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,600
actually in these clouds and

705
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
increasingly so

706
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
that makes it feel so impactful when

707
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
some of these go down so i would argue

708
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
that the internet itself is not

709
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
quite as centralized as some people are

710
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
kind of maybe making it out to be

711
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
um

712
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
but rather that it's it's it's about the

713
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
content of what we have in those clouds

714
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
rather than uh the spread of actual

715
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,720
services

716
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,679
so now let's talk a little bit about

717
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,279
risks and vulnerabilities on the

718
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
internet

719
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,120
so

720
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
we chose a couple of dates about six

721
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
months apart

722
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
and sampled two million hosts from each

723
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
of these dates from our universal

724
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,960
internet data set so it's total of about

725
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
four million hosts

726
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
and then

727
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
we ran each of these hosts through this

728
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
risks engine that powers our attack

729
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
surface management platform so remember

730
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
i mentioned earlier how we'll we'll find

731
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,320
your assets but we'll also find risks on

732
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
your assets so this is this is that same

733
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
technology but we just used it for a

734
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,080
slightly different purpose

735
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,279
um

736
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,880
before moving on i do want to throw out

737
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
two caveats about the data i'm about to

738
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,799
show you

739
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,799
so i very carefully uh said well not on

740
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
the slide but it very carefully said at

741
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
the beginning

742
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
that this would be census visible risks

743
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,440
and vulnerabilities and i want to put

744
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
that caveat on here because for us to

745
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,159
see a risk or a vulnerability in the way

746
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,840
that i'm about to show you there are two

747
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
things that have to be true

748
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,720
the first of which is that there must be

749
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,799
some public internet facing uh artifact

750
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,720
that we're able to see from passively

751
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,559
scanning the internet to be able to

752
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,240
detect something so for instance maybe

753
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
it's a banner that says hacked or maybe

754
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
it's a software version we're able to

755
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
discern from passive scanning uh that

756
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
will show us you know that we know is a

757
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
vulnerable software version so it has to

758
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
be something it's public internet facing

759
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
and then the second thing that has to be

760
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,960
true

761
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,600
is much in the same way that an ids or

762
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,559
an ips can't fire without signatures

763
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,399
we have to have a fingerprint written

764
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
for a particular risk or vulnerability

765
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,240
to to have it included in this data i'm

766
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
about to show you

767
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,640
and so as of as of now i think we're

768
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
around 250 or 300 different risk

769
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,320
fingerprints i think it's closer to 300

770
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,679
but i would keep that in mind and i will

771
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,679
say so there is definitely some bias to

772
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,880
this data which i think is really

773
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,679
important to acknowledge um that this is

774
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,360
in no way everything on the internet

775
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,880
it's what we're able to see and what

776
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
we're able to capture

777
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,440
so

778
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
we group our risks and vulnerabilities

779
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
into kind of three categories you can

780
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,919
see them here i won't i won't read these

781
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,000
definitions to you but i'm curious by

782
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,440
show of hands

783
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,039
um how many people think

784
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,440
misconfiguration is the top risk on the

785
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,559
internet

786
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,880
i'm gonna ask about all of them so

787
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
okay

788
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,360
how many of you think that exposures are

789
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
the most like the top thing we see on

790
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,080
the internet

791
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,360
okay

792
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
how about vulnerabilities how many of

793
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,159
you think vulnerabilities are the things

794
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,000
we see most of

795
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,240
okay

796
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,279
all right

797
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,240
i'm gonna i'm gonna give you a

798
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
cliffhanger here for a moment and just

799
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,559
talk about the risks themselves so

800
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,320
you'll notice yes there are lots of

801
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,039
exposures here um there are lots of eol

802
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,240
or end-of-life software on this list

803
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
again this is a function largely of what

804
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,080
our data is good at seeing because we're

805
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,840
not a vulnerability scanner we don't

806
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,559
attempt any kind of uh intrusion or like

807
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,760
we don't attempt to access anything this

808
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,679
is all passively scanning what's out on

809
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,200
the internet

810
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,039
and so i want to talk through like these

811
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,559
top three because i think they're kind

812
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,799
of kind of interesting so the first two

813
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,360
actually um the first two being missing

814
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
common security headers uh so missing

815
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,760
like content security policy and then

816
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,159
self-signed certificates uh just

817
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
self-explanatory um i don't think

818
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
they're hugely concerning in and of

819
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
themselves right like we actually assign

820
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,919
them a risk uh severity of low i believe

821
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
and it's not that they're not

822
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
problematic it's just that

823
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,679
on their own they are probably not going

824
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,039
to be the thing

825
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
on their own like not chained with

826
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
anything else they're going to get your

827
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,679
crown jewels taken from you right

828
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,200
they'll probably be chained with several

829
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,640
other things to make that happen

830
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
i will say that if i were like an early

831
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,039
security hire at an organization and i

832
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,039
saw lots of like

833
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
flags for this kind of thing like no no

834
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,200
security headers lots of self-signed

835
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,080
certificates that would be a sign to me

836
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,799
that perhaps other security concerns

837
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,880
might be sort of flying under the radar

838
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,720
and so while i wouldn't necessarily

839
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,559
think that those were the alarms they

840
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
would be little little small red flags

841
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
maybe pink flags if you will um that

842
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
would make me think maybe i should go

843
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,159
talk to the dev teams and kind of see

844
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,600
what's going on however

845
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,918
uh

846
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,520
unencrypted weak authentication page is

847
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,679
a risk i want to talk about

848
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,679
so this specifically refers to

849
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,480
authentication or login pages that do

850
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
not use tls so everything is transmitted

851
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,399
over http

852
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
and they use either basic or digest auth

853
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,279
so they're sending credentials over the

854
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,760
wire either plain text or

855
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
md5 hashed which is

856
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,919
no one should use that for security

857
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,320
purposes ever it's like base 64 encoding

858
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,720
um so really insecure ways to transmit

859
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,960
credentials

860
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
this is actually a really huge problem

861
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
in my opinion so

862
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
credential theft is is not going away

863
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,760
it's very old tactic but it's not going

864
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,240
away you all of the data breaches all

865
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
the things for sale on the dark web or

866
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,000
on these forums like it their

867
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,720
credentials their stolen credentials um

868
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,519
in fact the 2022 verizon data breach

869
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,000
investigations report actually names i

870
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,159
believe it's stolen credentials as one

871
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,360
of the top

872
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,679
threat actions or action varieties

873
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
rather that they see

874
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,760
in breaches and incidents

875
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
and so i want to point out like this is

876
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
still a really common problem and it is

877
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,159
not it has not gone away um

878
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,679
and so this

879
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,200
this is something i would want to fix

880
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
like that's something that i would be

881
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,840
digging into very

882
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,880
quickly okay

883
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,799
so here are the numbers i i gave a

884
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
little suspense there hopefully um here

885
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,480
are the numbers for the different

886
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,559
categories of risk that we see and the

887
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,279
relative percentages they make um so for

888
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,880
those of you who said misconfigurations

889
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,480
were the top thing on the internet

890
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,200
congratulations you are correct

891
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
they represent about 60 percent not

892
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
about they represent 60

893
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,240
of the risks that we see on the internet

894
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,640
um exposures are 28

895
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,840
and vulnerabilities are 12

896
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
again i will say there is certainly some

897
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,320
inherent bias in this data because of

898
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,799
what we're good at seeing and detecting

899
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,640
but i also think that this is a really

900
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,159
interesting

901
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,600
perspective

902
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,120
because

903
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,600
we make a lot of there's a lot around

904
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,120
there's a lot of noise there's a lot of

905
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
words are hard there's a lot of noise

906
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,399
around um

907
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,159
about like zero days really hot

908
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,320
vulnerabilities really cool technical

909
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
exploits and i mean they are cool i mean

910
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,399
i love reading about them too

911
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,480
but the reality of what is actually

912
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
going to get a company breached uh

913
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
is probably very different particularly

914
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,799
like if you look at this data as as

915
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,960
evidence of of where the problems are

916
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,760
right

917
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,679
so while the vulnerabilities are really

918
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,440
exciting to talk about

919
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,760
i think it's probably more likely that

920
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
security hygiene is the thing that's

921
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,000
worth investing in uh long term overall

922
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
so now let's talk about the internet's

923
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,440
response to some major vulnerabilities

924
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,919
so this is an area chart that shows the

925
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,640
internet's response to the log 4j

926
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,480
vulnerability

927
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,880
this line represents when uh the

928
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
disclosure happened

929
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
and you can see almost immediately so

930
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,039
these snapshots are there

931
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,480
access shows bi-monthly but they are

932
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
monthly and you can see almost an

933
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,200
immediate like sharp trend upward in

934
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
terms of not vulnerable versions as dark

935
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,840
or purple and you can also see a sharp

936
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,120
decline

937
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,600
in vulnerable versions so people really

938
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,440
jumped on this i mean it was everywhere

939
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,880
it was a terrible time to be in security

940
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
operations or in security or in it or

941
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,559
quite frankly if you're in software

942
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,399
engineering in a small company it was

943
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,960
just a really bad really stressful time

944
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,240
um right around the holidays and so

945
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,399
people responded to this really quickly

946
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,240
and again it was very severe so it made

947
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,159
sense that people would would take it

948
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,440
very seriously and it was also

949
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
everywhere god i think we're still

950
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,320
finding places where it exists

951
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,679
so let's contrast that with um

952
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,560
the internet's response to this gitlab

953
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
vulnerability it was a remote code

954
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
execution vulnerability

955
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,679
and

956
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,079
the actual disclosure

957
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,159
happened a month before the data on this

958
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,599
chart begins

959
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,359
but what i'll say is you can start to

960
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,679
see like um this dark purple that's not

961
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
vulnerable you can see there's like a

962
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
steady trend upward we're good we're

963
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
good we're good we're patching things

964
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
are happening and then we get here

965
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
this is november 3rd when there's a

966
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,760
tweet that goes out um a tweet that goes

967
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,440
out that's that's saying that hey this

968
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
gitlab vulnerability is being exploited

969
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,918
and used

970
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,159
in a botnet that's ddosing people and

971
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,839
then people started paying attention

972
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,679
people were like oh we got to fix this

973
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,839
and so you start to see this curve trend

974
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,679
a little bit more sharply upward because

975
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
people are like oh this seems like a big

976
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,839
deal it caught on it got popular

977
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,400
um

978
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
which is which is something we'll talk

979
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,680
about in a moment

980
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,640
and then finally for this section um i

981
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
want to talk about the confluence

982
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,560
vulnerability um so this was

983
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,440
um an ognl injection vulnerability um

984
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,839
and it was disclosed

985
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,720
here i believe this was in may i'm

986
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,640
totally misremembering uh in august i'm

987
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,520
sorry this is in august and so again you

988
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,839
see very quickly um

989
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,640
things start getting getting patched

990
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,800
but what's really interesting to me

991
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
about looking at this data for

992
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,160
confluence which might not have been as

993
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
immediately obvious if i had not like

994
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,760
graphed this

995
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,880
is

996
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
there's a whole lot of empty space up

997
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
here

998
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,400
because people took confluence servers

999
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,520
offline as a response to this disclosure

1000
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,160
which makes me wonder

1001
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
who is out there running confluence just

1002
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,040
like as a hobby like or i mean are are

1003
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,960
they do they just like have them

1004
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,079
floating out there and they're like oh

1005
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,280
well now it's vulnerable i guess i'll

1006
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
turn it off like i don't really need it

1007
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,800
anyway like what's going on there i

1008
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
think this is a really interesting

1009
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,960
phenomenon i'm still not quite sure that

1010
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,320
i've wrapped my head around the

1011
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,960
reasoning why

1012
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,040
but

1013
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
there are a lot of differences in the

1014
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,920
way

1015
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,000
these responses happened right like we

1016
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
looked at the curves we kind of talked

1017
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,920
about time to like patch after the

1018
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,720
disclosure um you know log4j was

1019
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,079
immediate uh git lab took a botnet to

1020
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,920
get really really popular

1021
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,160
and uh confluence just sort of people

1022
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,200
started taking things offline things

1023
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,119
just went away because no one wanted

1024
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,200
their confluence servers anymore i guess

1025
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,000
so

1026
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
for whatever reason when i think about

1027
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
these things i always think about like

1028
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,920
untangling like lots of tiny necklaces

1029
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,520
that are tangled together because i

1030
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,119
think there are a lot of elements to

1031
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
pull apart with what's going on here and

1032
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,359
what caused these responses to be so

1033
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,759
different

1034
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,720
so this is a screenshot from google

1035
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,839
trends

1036
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,520
for log 4j

1037
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,079
and you can see that it hits its peak

1038
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,640
right there um around this is in

1039
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,119
december well in december

1040
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,880
it got really popular it hit peak

1041
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
popularity per google trends which i'm

1042
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,079
not saying this is like a super

1043
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,000
scientific way to look at things but i

1044
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,720
do think for kind of measuring general

1045
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,599
like

1046
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,440
societal awareness or curiosity about

1047
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
things it can be useful

1048
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,440
and then compare that with uh kind of a

1049
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
similar thing for the git lab

1050
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,160
vulnerability

1051
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,720
and you you do see a little bit of a

1052
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,800
jump here when when it was released in

1053
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
may but it doesn't actually start to get

1054
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,280
traction it doesn't hit peak until much

1055
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
later that year this is actually in

1056
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
december which is like a month after

1057
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
that tweet went out talking about hey

1058
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,640
this is being used in a botnet

1059
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,599
um

1060
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,560
so i think there are a lot

1061
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,599
of

1062
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,160
different elements that go into this um

1063
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,839
i'm particularly interested in looking

1064
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,079
further into like things on twitter as

1065
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,599
far as how those relate to um

1066
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,760
to how popular vulnerability gets to how

1067
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,640
much awareness gets uh brought to it

1068
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,599
because i think there's there's

1069
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,359
something we can do better as a security

1070
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,480
community there i don't know exactly

1071
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,920
what it is but the variety of responses

1072
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,280
in all of these they were all pretty

1073
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,240
severe um log4js arguably probably the

1074
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
worst um

1075
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,040
but

1076
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
it's interesting to see how people

1077
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
respond to these things differently in

1078
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,640
aggregate

1079
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
so now i'll get to the long tail i had

1080
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
to cut this to just one example because

1081
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,240
i wanted to make sure there was a little

1082
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,040
time afterwards um but i mentioned you

1083
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,160
know before i think i talked about um

1084
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,560
179 000 versions of ssh

1085
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,440
software seems real weird to me

1086
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,240
um so i started looking at the tail

1087
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,119
and

1088
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,359
you can see like none of the these are

1089
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,920
these are not real this is not real um

1090
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
this is

1091
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
i actually don't know entirely what this

1092
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
is this could be a script gone awry this

1093
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
could be something broken these could be

1094
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,359
hacked instances of things like

1095
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,040
possibilities abound

1096
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,280
but there are several thousand of them

1097
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,640
in this data set

1098
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
so there's that

1099
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,359
um

1100
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
and i was like okay well let's look

1101
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,320
maybe at just open ssh versions

1102
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,240
of which there are also a lot in this

1103
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,359
data set

1104
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,599
but you can see that there's also some

1105
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,280
weirdness here open ssh hidden open ssh

1106
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,599
mock um welcome

1107
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
lots of really unusual like some too

1108
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,320
many spaces like just lots of weird

1109
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,000
things going on here

1110
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,200
and so i was looking at this i was

1111
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
actually just looking at this manually

1112
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,640
um kind of scrolling through and seeing

1113
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
what what was what was out there

1114
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,680
and i found this

1115
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,480
so i found this in

1116
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,440
march of this year

1117
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
the current version of open ssh in march

1118
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
of this year i believe was 8.9

1119
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,560
uh open ssh 9 got released in april

1120
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,720
so this this is like this doesn't exist

1121
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,400
so what is this

1122
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,480
um so a colleague and i started kind of

1123
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,160
googling around and trying to figure out

1124
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,560
like did we travel to the future what is

1125
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,240
going on here

1126
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,599
so we found this

1127
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,359
um from like five years ago so this has

1128
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,760
been going on for for a while

1129
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
um

1130
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,960
or someone reports finding something

1131
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,319
very similar like they've done an nmap

1132
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,240
scan and they're finding like open ssh

1133
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,359
12 and they're like wtf that's weird

1134
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,359
and one of the top or the top answer

1135
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
rather is that this is deliberate this

1136
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,240
is a thing that someone's actually

1137
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
broadcasting for some reason i'm not

1138
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,440
going to speculate as to why um

1139
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
it seems to be associated with a

1140
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
particular firewall vendor who may or

1141
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,040
may not be interested in not

1142
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,079
broadcasting their ssh version to the

1143
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,000
internet to pen testers to whoever um

1144
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
i won't i won't i won't go into that but

1145
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
there are theories on why this might be

1146
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,240
the case um

1147
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
but i'll point out that like things like

1148
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
this are they abound on the internet the

1149
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,160
internet is a huge huge place and this

1150
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
is just one tiny example of something

1151
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,079
that we were able to find just from kind

1152
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,839
of digging in and looking at kind of

1153
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
getting away from the bulk of services

1154
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,920
and the bulk of things and looking at

1155
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,079
things kind of the the end of the tale

1156
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,079
of the distribution

1157
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,000
um

1158
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,119
okay so why does any of this matter who

1159
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,560
cares this is what does it mean

1160
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,480
so i think there's two main things that

1161
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,560
i hope you'll walk away with

1162
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,599
from this

1163
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,520
and the first is that

1164
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,400
really good exploratory data analysis or

1165
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
descriptive statistical analysis

1166
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,560
is critical for asking better questions

1167
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,480
doing better analysis building better

1168
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,520
models

1169
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,480
um

1170
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,359
it's really important like you can't you

1171
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,520
shouldn't build models on top of data

1172
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,040
that you don't understand you absolutely

1173
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,119
can but this is one of those we were so

1174
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,720
consumed with whether we could we didn't

1175
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
stop to think whether we should you

1176
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,599
shouldn't

1177
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,000
um because that exploratory data

1178
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
analysis gives you a sense of you know

1179
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,760
what to do like you're going to run into

1180
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
missing data you're going to run into

1181
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,960
issues with it and so what are you going

1182
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,920
to do in having the context around the

1183
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,440
data set itself and kind of

1184
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,880
understanding how common these things

1185
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
are within your data set are really

1186
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,319
important

1187
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,079
and then secondly

1188
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,920
from a security practitioner perspective

1189
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
one of the things that like putting

1190
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,119
putting my security engineer hat back on

1191
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,160
for a moment

1192
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,440
um

1193
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,040
using data analysis like you don't have

1194
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,119
to be a data scientist or an analyst to

1195
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,640
make use of things like this and

1196
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,160
certainly i hope folks who are not in

1197
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,680
these roles are also doing this kind of

1198
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,720
stuff

1199
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
if you're a security engineer if you are

1200
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,800
a security operations center analyst or

1201
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,040
researcher um

1202
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
being able to look at data like this and

1203
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
figure out the important pieces of it

1204
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,800
and pull out things that are really

1205
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,040
relevant to you or to your organization

1206
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,960
are really important because

1207
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,319
we know that now more than ever there's

1208
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,920
there's alert fatigue alert fatigue at

1209
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,119
this point is almost kind of a joke

1210
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,599
because it's just it is it exists and i

1211
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,119
don't know that there's any solution to

1212
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,280
it that's viable at this point

1213
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
and so being able to comb through data

1214
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
and figure out okay you know what

1215
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,200
i see that we have 20 vulnerabilities

1216
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,560
that are that are in

1217
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,319
with 200 vulnerabilities our pen test

1218
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,160
found 200 vulnerabilities

1219
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,480
um i am one security engineer in a

1220
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
mid-sized organization what do i do

1221
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,040
where do i focus well maybe i can look

1222
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
at what's being exploited in the wild

1223
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,359
maybe i can look at the most common

1224
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,119
risks and vulnerabilities that exist on

1225
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,040
the internet and get a better sense of

1226
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
how to structure my approach and where

1227
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,720
i'm going to have the most impact early

1228
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,240
on um

1229
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,359
so i think i think it's it's a

1230
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,119
double-edged sword well maybe that's a

1231
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,560
terrible analogy it's not a double shot

1232
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,079
it's two swords it's like it's two

1233
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,640
swords two samurai swords because you

1234
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,560
get to know your data better it helps

1235
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
you prioritize things it's very helpful

1236
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,200
all around

1237
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,160
so

1238
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,839
thank you all

1239
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,000
so much for taking the time to come to

1240
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,160
this session i really really appreciate

1241
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,839
it

1242
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,200
um again you have lots of options for

1243
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,640
things for other talks you could go to

1244
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
so thank you for coming to this one

1245
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,520
and

1246
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,280
i would also really like to thank the

1247
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,760
census research team uh so mark and

1248
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,400
himacha and mark and zakir

1249
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
i really appreciate all of you like

1250
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,920
research is a team sport none of this

1251
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,839
happens solo none of this happens in a

1252
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,960
vacuum and uh you know it really helps

1253
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,720
to have an amazing group of folks to

1254
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,880
like kick around ideas with and explore

1255
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,520
things together

1256
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
so with that i will leave you uh with

1257
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,920
these two qr codes which are certainly

1258
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
not sketchy at all

1259
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,960
um

1260
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,280
one of which is actually this i'm not

1261
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,560
going to spoil a surprise you can you

1262
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,319
can check it out but the one on the

1263
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,359
right

1264
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,480
if this data was interesting to you

1265
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,680
looking at the internet as a whole

1266
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,800
looking at vulnerabilities on the

1267
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,359
internet if this is interesting to you

1268
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,480
keep an eye out for our 2022 state of

1269
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
the internet report

1270
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,520
so that's going to be coming out the

1271
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,599
first week of september

1272
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,760
and it's going to have all of this types

1273
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
this kind of data in it there will be

1274
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
some more stuff that i didn't even touch

1275
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,760
in today's presentation um

1276
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
but if you sign up now like you can sign

1277
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,280
up to get on the list to be notified

1278
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,359
when it uh when it gets released and if

1279
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,800
you do you'll be i think you'll be

1280
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,680
entered

1281
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,560
uh into a chance to win six months of

1282
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,880
our pro data which is essentially the

1283
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,240
data that i've used to do all this

1284
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,560
analysis so that's i think that's a cool

1285
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
perk uh that would i would be super

1286
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,000
excited to have six months of that for

1287
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,880
free

1288
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,000
um

1289
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,560
and yeah i i i really appreciate you all

1290
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,720
coming out thank you so much and i won't

1291
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,880
hold you from uh the security data

1292
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,319
science meetup i know people are

1293
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,720
probably eager to get to that but i'll

1294
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
take i think i have a few minutes for a

1295
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,720
couple questions and then we'll let

1296
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
people

1297
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,879
let people head to that

1298
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,640
hello

1299
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,960
it's not on

1300
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,599
is it on i think it's on i can

1301
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,640
uh so i was just

1302
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,839
i was just uh looking at the index index

1303
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,400
of the screenshots that you shared

1304
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,520
for the open ssh data and i

1305
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,599
i saw that

1306
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,480
basically for the open ssh

1307
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,560
your index was in the 600s and their

1308
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,119
count was already won so that made me

1309
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,040
wonder if actually

1310
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,520
that means that out of the 17 000

1311
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,560
ssh services that you observed

1312
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,520
um

1313
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,680
like almost all of them have a count of

1314
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
one and you only have

1315
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
a couple of hundred with a count larger

1316
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,400
than one

1317
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
is that correct

1318
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,720
yeah

1319
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
yeah so so the question was pertaining

1320
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,000
to like how many of those ssh uh at the

1321
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,359
end when i showed some of the tail of

1322
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,319
the ssh version distributions um so many

1323
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,839
of them were one like even into the

1324
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,920
hundreds they were just one of them and

1325
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
so the question is is it possible that

1326
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,839
some of like there's probably just maybe

1327
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,640
a few hundred real versions um i think

1328
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,480
that's probably the case i think that's

1329
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,559
i i would say all with almost certainty

1330
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,000
that that is probably true because i do

1331
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,280
not think

1332
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,200
maybe maybe i'm wrong i don't think

1333
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
there are that many versions of ssh

1334
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,359
software in existence um so i think i

1335
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,119
think you're probably right it's very

1336
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,200
much concentrated within like maybe a

1337
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,399
few hundred if that

1338
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,440
hey good talk

1339
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,359
uh so on one of your slides you had a

1340
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,680
dashboard that you were using for some

1341
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,760
analysis i was just wondering what tool

1342
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,160
that was made with and what was the like

1343
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,240
data on the back end

1344
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,200
sure

1345
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,440
sure so the question about um the

1346
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,640
dashboard

1347
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
so that was google data studio

1348
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,359
um connects right into bigquery makes it

1349
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,440
kind of easy well easy again is kind of

1350
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,119
relative but it makes it simple to

1351
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,520
connect data into to make those

1352
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,640
interactive

1353
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,880
dashboards and then the data on the back

1354
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,319
end was a subset of our internet wide

1355
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,240
scan data that i had filtered down to

1356
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,720
just http services with some of those

1357
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
attributes on it and in fact i can see

1358
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,160
if i can go back

1359
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,480
to where that was and look at that

1360
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,520
oh nope let's see

1361
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,759
wow

1362
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,960
okay wow sorry that took a long time

1363
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
felt like a very long time um so yeah so

1364
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,960
on the back end it was it was literally

1365
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,520
just a paired down version of um

1366
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,599
that that internet-wide scan data but

1367
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,280
joined up with

1368
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,920
this industry data from asdb and then

1369
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,920
vendor product port

1370
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,000
and geolocation or like country level

1371
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,839
data those are all just things native to

1372
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,359
our data so i pulled those out into a

1373
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,960
separate table so i wouldn't have to

1374
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,559
query the whole thing all the time

1375
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,599
because that gets a little bit

1376
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,160
prohibitively expensive um so yeah just

1377
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,078
just an http table on the back end

1378
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,960
absolutely

1379
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,000
any other questions

1380
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
does anybody know what is up with the 40

1381
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,400
029 ftp

1382
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,839
anybody

1383
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,480
anybody have theories please this is

1384
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,400
kind of like i just need to go sign up

1385
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,680
for an account and stand up some

1386
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,280
instances on alibaba cloud and see what

1387
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,200
happens i think

1388
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,280
[Laughter]

1389
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,480
awesome

1390
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,680
all right well thank you all so so much

1391
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,480
um and if you did not

1392
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,839
get to

1393
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,680
the qr code on the left that's actually

1394
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,520
just some some sample searches for

1395
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
census search and some resources for

1396
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
threat hunting with census it's really

1397
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,839
not malware so i'll leave that up but

1398
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,370
thank you all very much this is great

1399
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,569
[Applause]
