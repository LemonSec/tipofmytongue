1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
this is i am the cavalry and i'm going

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,640
to pass it over to yael

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,839
thank you thank you very much

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,960
you can hear me well there yeah okay

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,639
so um

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,679
welcome thanks for coming i'm jail i'm a

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
security consultant working at bishop

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,680
fox and today i'll be presenting an

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
introduction to ic security assessments

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
so let's begin

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,080
with who am i not i am not an ics

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
security expert but before you leave the

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
talk before i begin

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,480
let me explain why this talk

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
over the past

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
eight nine years that i've been working

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,320
on cyber security i have done several

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,719
penetration testings and other

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
security assessments where clients

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,280
sometimes come to us

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
and ask for

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
for us to perform or include ics

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
components into these security

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,640
assessments

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,760
so

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
usually our approach is to avoid this

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,039
because you know it's critical

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,840
infrastructure and can be broken can be

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
something that failed and that's not

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
good right

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
however i have done some research on

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
this and the aim of this talk is not to

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
give a methodology per se because there

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,280
are a lot of material out there that you

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
can check it out regarding methodology

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
and how to approach this kind of

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,439
infrastructure the idea of this

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
presentation is to provide from my

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
consultive experience some examples that

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,439
fit in each of these steps of the

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,799
methodology so so you can figure out a

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,799
yeah what can you do when you face this

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,960
kind of infrastructure

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,880
so um i'm not presenting new cool hacks

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
for plc's or something like that but i

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,240
did include some technical demos just to

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
keep it spicy

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,799
so first of all what is ics

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
according to the nist special

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
publication 837

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
ics refers to multiple components that

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,360
can be found in industrial sectors and

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
critical infrastructure this includes

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,479
sensors actuators software hardware and

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,280
so on basically it refers to everything

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,639
that controls physical processes and

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,640
usually there are there are physical

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,920
actuators in there to process that given

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,239
output and make a physical change into

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,760
an industrial

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
component

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,599
some examples of those probably you have

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,560
heard

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,959
of many of these ones we have a

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,360
supervisory control in that acquisition

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
or scada which usually are software

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
installed on a computer and it allows

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
users to track information that is

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
coming from

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
different kinds of equipment

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
this software also allowed to perform

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
operations or changing the programming

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
of these components

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
we also have distributed control systems

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,319
or dc dcs

76
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,840
which are a gathering of control

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
components to be managed in a

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
distributed manner instead of

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,720
individually we have programmable logic

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,959
controllers or plcs which are most of

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,599
the commons ics components that you will

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,560
heard

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
and this is basically hardware with

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
programmable memory that allows to

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
process an input and doing some internal

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
processing and generate an output with

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,239
this

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
rtus basically are hardware connectors

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,480
between scala and dca systems in but we

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
have we may have

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
more control components which are

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,840
basically distributed in a layer

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
structure from the physical layers until

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,440
the corporate network that we will be

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
analyzing in a moment

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
but

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
are these systems secure as you may know

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
no system is secure at least not all the

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
time ics is not the exception actually

100
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
they tend to be

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,319
even more insecure due to different

102
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
factors and problematics that we can

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
found that

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,560
um differ a little bit from what we

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
ordinarily see in it

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
some of this is the

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
inner design

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
these control components generally are

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
not meant to be secured

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
they don't have security built on these

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,360
devices

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
why well because vendors have other

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
programmatic at the time they

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
focus on operation and make the

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,680
operation not fall to continue and these

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
systems were never meant to be connected

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
or interconnected in

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
well in the internet that we are living

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
today

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
these systems are really also

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
basically that's why the

122
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
security is not built in

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
so because of that

124
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,800
we have for instance no controls for any

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
authorization or confidentiality or

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
integrity and this allowed to perform

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
different attacks that you may see on

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,960
the internet there are a lot of talks in

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
youtube videos regarding how you can

130
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,759
inject into these protocols how you can

131
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,080
intercept and or modify the operation of

132
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
these devices

133
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,720
however we also have implementation

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
flaws

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
besides the inherit lack of security

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
design in these systems when we

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,960
implement those components into our audi

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,000
network

139
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
we have also some implementation flaws

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,280
for instance it and ot may be

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
incorrectly or insufficiently segregated

142
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
or isolated one of each other maybe

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
more hosts that we intended for are

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
have access to these ot devices

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
we may have also had any issues such as

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
default credentials lack of credentials

147
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,199
you name it

148
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
and

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
what is more important is that

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
we may think why vendors doesn't

151
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
implement how are they security into

152
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
these devices reality is that industries

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
usually have little ability to include

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,400
security controls into ics components so

155
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
because of

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,720
all that

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,880
generally when we got access to ot

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
devices

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,758
that already means compromise

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,840
but

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
so how can we attack or how can we

162
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
access this kind of

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,759
yeah of components

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
i have included here three main

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
categories

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
you can find more in in the late

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
territory of plcs and

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
highly controlled environments

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
methodology

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
for the sake of this presentation

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
i i took research which generally is

172
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,240
made by an external entity or for

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,800
vendors where the main goal is to test

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,120
specific functionalities new releases

175
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
new components to find nowadays new

176
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
vulnerabilities all from the point of

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
view of the research that doesn't mean

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
that we as a security professional can

179
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,880
do this if we have a research area we

180
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,039
may have contacts with different vendors

181
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
that could facilitate us to have these

182
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
components and to test them with this

183
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,720
specific goal

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
we also have cyber security assessments

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,120
which can be done from a consulting

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,319
perspective

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,960
and the idea here is not to find new

188
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
vulnerabilities or old days the idea

189
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,880
here is to um doing

190
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,080
not an intrusive test not an active test

191
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
but we want to check that the

192
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
implemented or the deployed components

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
have actually met a best practices that

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
they are hardened that there are

195
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
policies and procedures not only in

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,599
paper but they are applied both to it

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,800
and ot

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,360
we have access control and many other

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,639
things

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
and then we could can move to a more

201
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
active testing that could be up interest

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
or a red team also from the consulting

203
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,080
point of view and well

204
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,720
the goal is like every other pen test is

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
to gain access to persist to people

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
to find vulnerabilities that can be

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,560
exploited or we can maybe

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
emulate

209
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,160
unknown threat

210
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
or to achieve custom goals that the

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
client is requiring

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
so

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
how can we test

214
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
these components the right way and i

215
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
mean the right way because the reality

216
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
is that these

217
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
systems are prone to fail

218
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
and we may broke something that's

219
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
natural on on this kind of

220
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
environments

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
so the

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
methodological approach

223
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
we follow

224
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
must take this into consideration

225
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
and we always should keep in mind that

226
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
we um

227
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,039
we must avoid

228
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
causing unacceptable impact on

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
operations

230
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
so does that mean that we can actually

231
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
cause any uh damage to operations and

232
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
well we don't want but

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
as i mentioned it it is a possibility

234
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
and that can happen so we can

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
we must plan on this so we don't

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
actually disrupt critical components if

237
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
we have the right conditions of when

238
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
where and what to test we can avoid

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,760
causing an acceptable our yeah damage to

240
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
critical components

241
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
and finally one thing we should care

242
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,560
about

243
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
as a consultant is that we need to

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,440
prioritize efficient risk reduction i

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
will dig a little bit more into this

246
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
later in the reporting section but the

247
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
idea is that we want to address the

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
issues we found

249
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,120
in

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
a way that actually provides value to

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
our clients

252
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,320
so

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
let's dig a little bit into the

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
methodology

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
and dan webber from collaborate security

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,519
established these steps as part of their

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
methodology i took this as an input

258
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,279
and the idea is not to dig deeper into

259
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
these

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
steps but again

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,399
the area of the presentation is to

262
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,560
provide some examples that fit on each

263
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,399
of these steps

264
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
so the first one is security effort

265
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
prioritations

266
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
what we want in this step is to

267
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
understand the security requirements the

268
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
organization has

269
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,440
what policies exist on the plant or or

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
industry both for ite and no team

271
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,519
is there any segregation isolation

272
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
do we have access control assets

273
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
inventory

274
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
do we have insulin response and recovery

275
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
process and procedures

276
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
we need to start with this because if we

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
don't have these initial steps

278
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
chances are that we won't be able to dig

279
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
further into more active testing because

280
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
it won't provide any any real value to

281
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,160
to a client if there is no an initial

282
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,480
step on their security poster

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
so oftentimes organizations may ask for

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
a penetration testing on a red team in

285
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
their

286
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,079
industrial components

287
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,880
but

288
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
probably we need to work with the client

289
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
and rescue this assessment so we can

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,560
find a way we can provide actual value

291
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,279
to

292
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,720
to the things we are assessing

293
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,920
the next step is process familiarization

294
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,880
here we can here we can do architecture

295
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
and physical reviews

296
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,040
inspect processes to

297
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,920
through

298
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
walkthroughs in the plant or in the

299
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,440
processes

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
interviews with the many stakeholders is

301
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
one of the key points of this kind of

302
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,880
assessments we

303
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
need to talk with the people that are

304
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
actually executing these processes and

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
exec and understanding how they are

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
working what processes are really in

307
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,319
place not not only in papers and

308
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,720
so if we have the previous step

309
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
if we know already that there are

310
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
policies and procedures we can test on

311
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,279
them if there is segregation in

312
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,480
isolation

313
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,040
stated on paper we can test that we can

314
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
make sure that this aggregation is

315
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
actually applying to ot and i team

316
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
so

317
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,079
how can we do that

318
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
we can do this by

319
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,600
leveraging some published frameworks

320
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
most of the

321
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
um yeah one of the most famous is the

322
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
nic cyber security framework

323
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
which states some

324
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
domains categories and subcategories

325
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
this is used in order to evaluate the

326
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
security model of the organization that

327
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,680
we are assessing in order to understand

328
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
what what is the maturity of this

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,839
security program

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,320
it is not a one-size-fits-all approach

331
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
however we need to

332
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
customize the the assessment we are

333
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,360
performing for the specific industry we

334
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,480
are dealing with

335
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
also it is worth mentioning that this

336
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
cyber security assessments can be really

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
complex can be a whole assessment by

338
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,279
itself not just a step on the

339
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,639
methodology

340
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
why because it requires a deep

341
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
understanding not only of security we

342
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,720
need to understand architecture we need

343
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
to understand technologies we need to

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
understand the processes and policies

345
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
that the organization is using or

346
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
applying to their their systems

347
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
imagine we are telling people that has

348
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
been working with this kind of devices

349
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,200
for more than 30 years and we just go

350
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
there and tell them you have no

351
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
authentication for your protocol you

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
need to implement security here here

353
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,079
here you need to change

354
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
the way you operate

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,240
that's probably not going to happen if

356
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,560
we don't understand that again as i

357
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
mentioned before security sometimes is

358
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
not on the side of the clients or they

359
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
have little ability to implement

360
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
security like this in in their systems

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
so we need to understand the technical

362
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
and not so technical aspects of their

363
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
jobs in order to provide real value what

364
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
we are recommending to fix

365
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,320
also people on ics security

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
and ics sorry usually appreciate when

367
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
security consultants or security experts

368
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
understand the different approaches that

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
it and ot have the different problems

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,000
they could face

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,959
so how does a cyber security assessment

372
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,320
looks like

373
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,800
looks like a spreadsheet sometimes it

374
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
can be a tedious work it is indeed

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
and in this first image i'm showing a

376
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
requesting

377
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,920
well the

378
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,839
yeah it's kind of

379
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,399
little but the idea is

380
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
this is an information gallery request

381
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,680
for a client

382
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
where we want to know what procedures

383
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
what documentation

384
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
what they have

385
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
for different domains based on the need

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
cyber security framework we want to know

387
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
if they have asset control policies if

388
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
they have a security or or audit

389
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
procedures if they have assets inventory

390
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,399
so we are requesting for this

391
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,959
information so then we can leverage the

392
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
cyber security framework using the

393
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,360
categories and subcategories to review

394
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
the documentation and find possible gaps

395
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
into the implementation of these

396
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,399
components

397
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
here we can leverage also the interviews

398
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
we have we or the walkthroughs in the

399
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
plant because it is not a checklist we

400
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,519
should not take this as a checklist okay

401
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,199
they they have policies for access

402
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,000
control they have asset inventory okay

403
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,959
check

404
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,720
it's not just that we have to make sure

405
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
that the inventory is covering not only

406
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
i.t they are covering the ot components

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,959
that are actually deployed on the plant

408
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
and make sure that they are complaining

409
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,000
with this is not an auditory it's a

410
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,320
cyber security assessment so we need to

411
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
find those gaps and see how can they

412
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,880
improve their security model

413
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,360
but we can not only rely on

414
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
spreadsheets there are also tools out

415
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,519
there that can help us to leverage these

416
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
kind of assessments one of those is the

417
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
cyber security evaluation tool it is by

418
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
the cyber security and information

419
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
security agency and

420
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,800
the awesomeness of this tool is that it

421
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,839
allows to load different frameworks that

422
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,399
are published for scada and other

423
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,399
process control components we can

424
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
leverage these frameworks loaded into a

425
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
matrix as it was an interview and what

426
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
is more important it allows to customize

427
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
these interviews or these questions that

428
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,639
we may ask to

429
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
to the organization

430
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,480
so

431
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,560
we don't always need to perform a whole

432
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,680
csa and again this can be really complex

433
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,759
really time consuming and

434
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
an assessment itself by a client that

435
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
probably they want to buy it or they can

436
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
afford it

437
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,519
but

438
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
we

439
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
have to do process familiarization

440
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,279
always to better understand the

441
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
organization from a cyber security

442
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
perspective

443
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,839
why because this will allow us to

444
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,759
do very important questions that will

445
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,839
help us to go deeper into more active

446
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
testing for instance we will know what

447
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,600
is the most important part of their

448
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,480
plant

449
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,839
what happens if

450
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
one or several critical processes they

451
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,359
have

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,160
breaks down or fails what happens if it

453
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,359
fails for

454
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
five minutes one hour a week

455
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,480
some processes may fail because of their

456
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
nature

457
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
but others can cause even death of

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,799
people if they fail for even one minute

459
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,439
so we need to understand that we need to

460
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,840
know if they have a

461
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
segregated networks if they have a

462
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,480
access

463
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
control for the

464
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
control components or their critical

465
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,559
infrastructure limited to specific holes

466
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,360
or specific components

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,760
we also need to know if they have

468
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
laboratory environments this is really

469
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,400
important when we want to test critical

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,520
processes

471
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,000
that cannot be tested online

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
so

473
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
these important questions will help us

474
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,559
to go deeper into the methodology

475
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,280
so

476
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
then after process familiarization we

477
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
can move forward to a passive

478
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
information gathering

479
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,320
here we can include monitor network

480
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
communications this can be done online

481
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,160
or offline we can do

482
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
test hardening or we can test best

483
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
practices that the components are

484
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,440
deployed are meeting specific best

485
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,000
practices for these protocols components

486
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
and so on and we can also include

487
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
hardware hacking in iot depending on

488
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
what is implemented on their critical

489
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,840
infrastructure to do those this story we

490
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,960
have well several tools both automated

491
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,520
we can do manual testing

492
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,400
we can

493
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,679
do or leverage scripting that many other

494
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
people have published on github and

495
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,679
there are also

496
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,760
vendor solutions that implement this

497
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,559
kind of threat

498
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
monitoring by doing a constant uh review

499
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
of the network communications within io

500
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,840
we know t sorry

501
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,200
so

502
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
let's talk about a little bit about

503
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,679
protocols interfaces and instruments in

504
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
the ics systems they use different

505
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,480
protocols for real-time communications

506
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,799
most of them are really old they were

507
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
first designed for serial communications

508
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,520
later on they implemented their tcp

509
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,919
versions and for instance let's take

510
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,320
modbus and x as an example which is one

511
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,480
of the oldest protocols we can find of

512
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
the

513
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
on ics components these data it's from

514
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,000
the 70s and well it meant

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,679
it was meant to

516
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,919
communicate with plcs

517
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,080
initially through serial communications

518
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
later on with tcpip

519
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,840
and the idea is to modify the

520
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
programming of these components

521
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
we can found these different protocols

522
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,280
also in a layered structure depending on

523
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
what we are seeing if we are seeing

524
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,559
actuators plcs scada systems or other

525
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,679
systems

526
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,840
can talk different protocols to

527
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
communicate with different ics

528
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,520
components and well this

529
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
little demo i think it can be seen more

530
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
or less

531
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
okay

532
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,400
the idea here is to analyze a packet

533
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,840
capture from modbus

534
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,000
communications so we need to know a few

535
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,440
things about the protocols we are

536
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,080
analyzing in this case modbus lacks of

537
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,440
authentication and lacks of encryption

538
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
so we only need an ip address and a

539
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,400
valid a function code in order to create

540
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
a modbus session

541
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,400
so for instance in serial communications

542
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
modbus uses broadcast

543
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,919
to

544
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
basically this means that with one

545
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,039
simple function called we can cause a

546
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,799
denial of service condition because it

547
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,400
is broadcasted through the entire

548
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,679
network

549
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,320
so again this protocol was designed for

550
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
programming and

551
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
modifying plcs rtus and other control

552
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,159
components and leveraging this we can

553
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
inject basically a malicious code into

554
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
into these components or modify the

555
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
programming of these components

556
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
in the give here what we are doing is

557
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
analyzing this of this modbus operation

558
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
we discriminate by iip and the package

559
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
is sent between these

560
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,320
hosts

561
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,559
and

562
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
if we go back a little bit into the

563
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,240
process familiarization and the

564
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
information gathering if we have a valid

565
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
asset inventory we can leverage this and

566
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
identify if these communications are

567
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
happening between

568
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,919
valid or allowed devices or maybe we are

569
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,320
seeing an unidentified device that is

570
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
talking with our control components and

571
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
actually modifying their programming

572
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
that could be interesting to further

573
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,360
analyze it could be a

574
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,000
yeah a system that is not inventory or

575
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
maybe it's a real attack we don't know

576
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,400
but we can

577
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
further investigate if we have the

578
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,480
previous steps done

579
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,679
so

580
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
in the analysis we have two codes

581
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,320
code five which is a writing function

582
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,600
and an id

583
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,159
which is a custom code that can be used

584
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,600
for several things

585
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
however there's an actual vulnerability

586
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,919
in one schneider electric component that

587
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,960
uses these knight codes to overwrite the

588
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,520
programming of the of the component so

589
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,080
again if we are not using these

590
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,559
operations that can be something to

591
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,080
analyze for or to investigate further

592
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,200
now

593
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
talking about active testing normally

594
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,559
if you can access or scan the ot it's

595
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
already game over this is how phrase

596
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
one's a friend told me this guy is

597
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,559
actually an actual ics security expert

598
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
and what he means is that even the most

599
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
basic scanning

600
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,000
most basic and non-intrusive scanning on

601
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
a plc or a hardly a

602
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,039
control network can be pretty dangerous

603
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
that can because denial of service all

604
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,159
along the network and the components

605
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,520
so

606
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
when we are doing active testing we need

607
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
to understand what consequences it can

608
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,799
have we can stop processes we can cause

609
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,360
some damage to physical equipment and we

610
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
can also even kill people in some

611
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,159
extreme cases depending on what we are

612
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,640
testing we what we are assessing

613
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,799
so to avoid these potential damages we

614
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,280
need to leverage or we can leverage

615
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
staging or lab environments we can use

616
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,400
redundancy if there is redundancy for

617
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
critical components we don't test what

618
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
is in production or we we don't test the

619
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
only point of failure that could break

620
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,520
something really important

621
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
for for the industry

622
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
so also we can select best times

623
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
of testing maybe there's a window where

624
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,159
we can test these processes and nothing

625
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
critical will will happen

626
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
if we do the interviews before probably

627
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,760
the

628
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,320
the many stakeholders will let let us

629
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,720
know when we can test better these these

630
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
components

631
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,840
and it is important also it is not on

632
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
the

633
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,000
on the slide but

634
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,080
we also need to know our tools we need

635
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
to be very careful with the upside we do

636
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
with our testing tools we need to know

637
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
how to customize them

638
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
to adequately to the environment way and

639
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
we are testing and not just throwing

640
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
tools that we find on github or also

641
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,679
so

642
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
within active testing we can do many

643
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
things we start of course with basic

644
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
enumeration

645
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,279
as any other

646
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,880
security assessment

647
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,600
but we don't scan for all ports we don't

648
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,960
do an nmap minus minus we can cause a

649
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,120
denial of service sometimes there are

650
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
some components that have open ports

651
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,400
expecting to receive updates or a

652
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
programming instructions and again we we

653
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
don't have authentication at all in

654
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
these protocols so

655
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,679
by sending random data using nmap or

656
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,760
whatever tool we can cause these devices

657
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
to interpret that as an instruction

658
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,960
it will change configuration and it will

659
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,919
crash

660
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,159
so we don't want to we don't want to do

661
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,120
that

662
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
there are also several tools and scripts

663
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,559
out there in github and other

664
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,919
both free and

665
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,520
from vendors solutions that can or try

666
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,480
to do this basic enumeration the

667
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,080
ideal it depends again on where and what

668
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
we are testing the idea is to follow a

669
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
more

670
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
manual approach or to know

671
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,880
really well our tools and how to

672
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,200
personalize and to use them in certain

673
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
environments

674
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,080
the high-level methodology is to do a

675
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
network sniffing

676
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,799
follow with an

677
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,159
rap scan do a map to specific ports we

678
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,080
look for management interfaces we don't

679
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,120
look for specific ics control components

680
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
protocols

681
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,279
yet

682
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,000
and we do network analysis it can be

683
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,480
both online and offline

684
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,760
and then we can follow custom attacks

685
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,559
and provided we are careful well we are

686
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,639
what we are testing where and when

687
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
other thing we can do with active

688
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
testing is for future scans

689
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
some of the vendors of specific control

690
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,919
components will provide

691
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,880
a some audit files that could be loaded

692
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
into specific tools

693
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
for instance the bandolier project from

694
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,400
digital bonds

695
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,960
they created some of these audit files

696
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,360
to load to be loaded on nesos and to

697
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,200
analyze a specific

698
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,240
i think it was modbus protocol

699
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,320
and nestos itself include included a

700
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,279
function called ics scada smart scanning

701
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,400
but as rapid7 states it could break

702
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,840
something so even with that features

703
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
we need to be careful and we need to

704
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
understand how they are working for this

705
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,039
specific case

706
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,279
the idea is that when wherever nessus

707
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,760
finds an ics component it stops scanning

708
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
so they don't bring things but

709
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
in order to identify that there is an

710
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
ics control component there nasa's

711
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,720
already touched it and this torch could

712
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,919
cause a damage so we need to be careful

713
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,720
with that

714
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,559
another thing we can do is secondary

715
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,080
application testing

716
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,039
in this case if we found a

717
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,039
management interfaces in this control

718
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
components we can perform a basic web

719
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
application testing we can see if those

720
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
interfaces are protected by password for

721
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,480
instance if they are to analyze if they

722
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,360
have weak passwords or default passwords

723
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
and for instance well we need to

724
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
remember that the attacker will take the

725
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
easy space but

726
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
not necessarily they will start

727
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,480
attacking

728
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,159
ics protocols because that could be

729
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,360
um really dangerous even for an attacker

730
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,000
and it could go just by testing the web

731
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,320
applications that are published and are

732
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
accessible for anyone from the corporate

733
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,520
network for instance in this case we are

734
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,720
seeing some uh two interfaces one from

735
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,279
honeywell intellige intellidoc system

736
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
which is for gas detection and the other

737
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
one is after a

738
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
automation portal

739
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
these devices have default and weak

740
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,279
credentials and basically allow access

741
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,399
as a domain a user and they allow to

742
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,559
modify the network configuration of

743
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,440
these devices depending on how and where

744
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
they are deployed this could be really

745
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,000
dangerous if they are detecting critical

746
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,360
components

747
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,279
so

748
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,200
and then we can move with

749
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
ics

750
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,080
exploitation again

751
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,440
when we do exploitation in ics

752
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,120
it's not the same as a normal

753
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,600
penetration testing we want to follow an

754
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,120
approach of

755
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
a means to an end we don't want to

756
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,559
exploit

757
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
things that the client or the industry

758
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,360
already know they are vulnerable to we

759
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,279
we don't want to to arrive the

760
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
organization and tell them okay i can

761
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,760
inject in your modus protocol they

762
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,679
already know that

763
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,559
i mean

764
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
there's a lot of information on that we

765
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
need to be very careful why we are

766
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
exploiting certain things maybe we want

767
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,480
to assess the actual risk of a critical

768
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,039
process the the client wants us to share

769
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,480
to show the

770
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,320
the actual risk to

771
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,159
to exploit something in that critical

772
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,200
process

773
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,039
and

774
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,159
and what

775
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,960
again we can use different tuning meant

776
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,600
for this kind of components

777
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,559
and it will be always dangerous to use

778
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,960
this tooling and

779
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
without the proper upset

780
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,480
on those

781
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,200
so

782
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
we also have the manual testing

783
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
as mentioned before there are a lot of

784
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
protocols components

785
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,399
uh configurations network

786
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,159
networks so

787
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
there are a lot of ways to do ics

788
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
exploration

789
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,360
i included some demos

790
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,159
i'm gonna fast forward them a little bit

791
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
because they are quite too long

792
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,880
but

793
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,760
in this case i put together a model

794
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
using two siemens logo plcs

795
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
one of those has an old version of of

796
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,279
the firmware of the device and is

797
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
allowing an attacker to leverage

798
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
unencrypted storage of passwords

799
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
so the plc allows to implement some

800
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,200
passwords on their programming or in

801
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
their modifications however this attack

802
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
allows to disclose these credentials

803
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,200
so

804
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,520
the first part is showing just how it

805
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
works it has a water sensor that once

806
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,559
it's

807
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,360
loaded into water and

808
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
reach certain level it will turn red the

809
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
screens of the plc's

810
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
indicating that it has reached certain

811
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,640
level and then it has an actuator in

812
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,799
this case it's just a fan but it could

813
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,799
be a turbine or something more uh

814
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,080
yeah more industrial

815
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,720
this is the programming of of these plcs

816
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
they are working in a master slave mode

817
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
so the idea here or what i want to show

818
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,159
is that the master is receiving this

819
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,480
information and it is

820
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,640
then publishing this information to the

821
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
slave or the slaves plcs through the

822
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
transport service access point which

823
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,000
basically is a a protocol used for

824
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,640
addressing applications a plc can open a

825
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,080
server in a specific s7 port or s7

826
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,159
connection and will

827
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,480
wait for connections from other plc's

828
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
into this specific s7 connection s7 by

829
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,720
the way is the protocol these plcs are

830
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,840
using

831
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,360
so

832
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,720
this is a

833
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,159
configuration

834
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,720
and then

835
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,200
it's quite small

836
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
but

837
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,039
again the idea here i

838
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,240
it's begin

839
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,399
doing a basic scanning

840
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,600
not touching anything related to ics

841
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,480
necessarily we are done we are doing a

842
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,679
http ftps search

843
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,760
different kind of protocols

844
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
but specific

845
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,158
and then

846
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,360
in this case i was using um well we

847
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,279
identified the protocol which is running

848
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,559
on port 5.0

849
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519
now i'm lying we identify first the

850
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
web interfaces

851
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,440
the http ports

852
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,480
we access those http ports

853
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,360
and this without actually scanning ics

854
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,279
protocols we already identified that we

855
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,159
have a siemens uh this device in there

856
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,720
just by browsing into the web interface

857
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
that is published

858
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,760
we then try it is password protected we

859
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
can try some

860
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
some credentials on it

861
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,720
we observe that in the first case this

862
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,679
device has a password access disabled so

863
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,919
we won't be able to do anything there

864
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,320
like sorry

865
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,360
but then we moved to the other

866
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,080
plc doing exactly the same we browse to

867
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
the web application we identify it it

868
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,440
has some documentation on it which

869
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,080
allows us to identify which version is

870
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,960
running on this device

871
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,480
so we know this device is not

872
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,159
vulnerable because of the version but

873
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,320
because of what we have seen on these

874
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
plcs and the difference between them we

875
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,039
can assume the other plc is another

876
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,600
version because this is the most recent

877
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,799
one

878
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,159
so

879
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,519
using

880
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
love environment we can leverage those

881
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,559
cvs

882
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,519
and we can use in this case the client

883
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,200
can

884
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,559
facilitate us with this

885
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
dll

886
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,719
now it was in the dealer it was a jar

887
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,759
file which ha hard coded the

888
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
sorry

889
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
the key used for this attack

890
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
so it is hardcoded on the programming

891
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,239
software

892
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,719
used to program these devices

893
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
this key which is then leveraged by an

894
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,520
nmap script

895
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,480
we have to do some adjustments so we can

896
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,560
change the

897
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,679
the key to the correct format we modify

898
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,760
the ncs grid on the left

899
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,359
then we run it against

900
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,359
the specific protocol this time we know

901
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
we have an uh siemens plc in there so we

902
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
already know which protocol we can use

903
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
in this case it says s7 which is

904
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,320
published on the phi of two

905
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,440
port

906
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,119
we check it is open

907
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,440
and then we launch the attack which in

908
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
this case uh yeah

909
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,560
shows all the clear text credentials

910
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,359
where i where it applies

911
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,599
even for the web access

912
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,920
so leveraging these credentials and

913
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,160
using some of the well-known

914
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
vulnerabilities or misconfigurations we

915
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
already know we can use them for the

916
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,800
other plc which

917
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
actually have a web access so it is just

918
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,880
reusing credentials found in one plc in

919
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
the other plc

920
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,839
and

921
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,800
i sorry i moved

922
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
finally we have we have access to the

923
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,400
plc and in this case it's not showing

924
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
much

925
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
but in real life chances are that we

926
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,680
have

927
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000
not only showing what is happening on

928
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
the physical device but that we also

929
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
have the ability to change the physical

930
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
configuration through this web

931
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
configuration or through this web

932
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,720
application

933
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,079
so

934
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,800
this is one demo and the other one

935
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
is this one leveraging

936
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
sorry

937
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,839
in this case what we want to do is to

938
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,520
leverage uh

939
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,200
or to abuse the s7 protocol

940
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,720
i don't know if it can be seen very well

941
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,880
but using the same model

942
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,119
we already identified there's an s7

943
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
protocol in there we already know that

944
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,320
we have two plc's one in master and one

945
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,119
in slave mode so imagine you have

946
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,839
several slaves not only one slave and we

947
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,320
can pick one of those without affecting

948
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,960
the actual process and we can test on

949
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,920
this specific device as isolated from

950
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,320
the critical process itself

951
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,359
so what we want to do is to test

952
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,920
the configuration as mentioned before

953
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,839
the master is publishing the information

954
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,320
he got from the sensor into the other

955
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,359
slaves uh well in into one tsap

956
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,200
application and the other slaves are

957
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,960
gathering this information from this

958
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
d-sub connection

959
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
so what we want to do here

960
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,680
is to leverage this in the first case i

961
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,359
use a

962
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,960
publish script

963
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,359
that allows to do that to identify these

964
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
apps on the plcs we run it

965
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,720
the tool didn't identify and it is any

966
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,960
valid this app so i moved to python

967
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,119
using the snap 7

968
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,560
library

969
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,920
i was able to let me show you

970
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,119
to connect to the device

971
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,359
there

972
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,760
using a specific address

973
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
so

974
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,040
we are seeing in this example what we

975
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,960
are seeing there is what is being

976
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,119
published on this specific memory

977
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,240
address of the device

978
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,119
which in reality is the data gathered

979
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
from the actual sensor the water level

980
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,160
sensor

981
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,359
so

982
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,599
what we want to do with that

983
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,640
is to

984
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,680
change this information

985
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,480
and inject some invalid or not expected

986
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,520
data

987
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,720
so again we do some changes

988
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,359
and we do an injection

989
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,160
however by doing it manually

990
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,640
we inject the data but whenever we read

991
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,040
again we get the actual information

992
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
because the sensor is sending

993
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,280
constantly the information so our

994
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
injection

995
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,359
won't work unless we

996
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,800
use a loop

997
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
so

998
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,640
as you can see on the right

999
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,720
there are the two plcs we are attacking

1000
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,880
the one on the right

1001
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,040
and as we can see the sensor is of the

1002
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
water it's right

1003
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,119
here

1004
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,359
so

1005
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
whenever we start the loop

1006
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,280
injecting some

1007
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,839
random

1008
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,320
data it turns red the master is not

1009
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,640
affected but we are writing into the

1010
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,800
memory of the attack

1011
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,079
plc and the water sensor is of the water

1012
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,640
the fan is also being actioned so in

1013
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,960
this case if we are testing this in a

1014
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
controlled environment we are affecting

1015
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,680
or we are showing the risk of getting

1016
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,920
access to these protocols without any

1017
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
other controls in it and we are not

1018
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
affecting the the master

1019
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,119
which can be the critical process of

1020
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,480
this

1021
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,960
and also we can script that make a

1022
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,400
little tool that can serve us for

1023
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
further engagements

1024
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,440
and yep it works

1025
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,879
so

1026
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
trust me you are vulnerable

1027
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,920
and no security assessment is done

1028
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
without the documentation

1029
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,240
but what we want to recommend for this

1030
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,079
kind of assessments

1031
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,440
we probably

1032
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,480
or we certainly don't want a compressive

1033
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
list of issues to address

1034
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
why again

1035
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,319
these industries already have they have

1036
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,680
issues

1037
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,520
they have little ability to include

1038
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,160
security of these components so what we

1039
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,800
want to do is to prioritize efficient

1040
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
risk reduction

1041
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,000
which i mentioned at the beginning of

1042
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,319
the presentation but what we meant with

1043
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,480
this is that we need to understand that

1044
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,359
itnot face different problems they have

1045
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,520
different operational goals

1046
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,400
so what are good issues to report lack

1047
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
of authentication clear test protocols

1048
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,520
legacy software insecure applications

1049
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
yes of course we need to to report that

1050
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,160
because those are issues but if we only

1051
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,119
report that and the industries already

1052
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,680
know that what value are we providing to

1053
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,040
these clients

1054
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,000
so

1055
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,560
what instead uh

1056
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
as i mentioned also before

1057
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
vendors usually expect that clients

1058
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
implement security requirements into

1059
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,000
their uh critical components or critical

1060
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,319
processes while clients expect that

1061
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,920
vendors include security on their

1062
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
critical components and this is a

1063
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,440
never-ending

1064
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
problem or fight between those two and

1065
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,520
if we as a consultant just get there any

1066
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,319
and suggest to or recommend to do what

1067
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,240
they already know does not provide any

1068
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,880
value to them instead of that we need to

1069
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,040
leverage the cyber security assessment

1070
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,160
we have done

1071
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
we need to leverage the passive

1072
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
information gathering the understanding

1073
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,960
of the industry and if we do some active

1074
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,800
testing we need to leverage all those

1075
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,040
steps in the methodology so we can

1076
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,160
recommend

1077
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,000
things that actually provide value to

1078
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
the security program of the organization

1079
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
and it can be improved

1080
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
for instance we have uh

1081
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
well i included some examples here such

1082
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,560
as insufficient communications between

1083
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
it and ot

1084
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,440
it

1085
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,720
this is a

1086
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,880
great issue to report if those teams are

1087
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,760
not talking to each other chances are

1088
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,720
that what is being implemented in it is

1089
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,200
not implemented in ot and we have lack

1090
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,680
of security in those communications

1091
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,599
also if the cyber security program that

1092
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,480
is being implemented in iit probably it

1093
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,800
is quite robust but if it doesn't

1094
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,319
include ot chances are that ot is

1095
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,200
quite unprotected from basic attacks

1096
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,480
such as

1097
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,839
um reaching the ot infrastructure from

1098
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,720
the corporate network which as stated

1099
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,119
before access oftentimes means

1100
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,200
compromise

1101
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,598
and so

1102
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,319
also if we don't have clear duties

1103
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,400
between it and ot

1104
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
there's a problem because if you have

1105
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,520
found different issues to the security

1106
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,680
program and they don't know who should

1107
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,920
be implementing these fixes

1108
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,319
this won't happen and

1109
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,319
it's an issue that you reported and it's

1110
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,040
just there without any solution

1111
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,440
also we we should identify physical

1112
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,000
security weaknesses

1113
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,640
those are security controls that are

1114
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,280
implemented physically so if there are

1115
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
physical security vulnerabilities and we

1116
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,560
can access those devices physically

1117
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,440
that's also already compromised

1118
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,119
lack of monitoring insufficient

1119
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,520
hardening unnecessary network services

1120
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,480
running those are also world mention

1121
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,359
issues to report recommended time of

1122
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,000
objective again we are not

1123
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,160
attacking some critical components and

1124
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,839
expect that they recover from us

1125
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,680
failing or throwing away their critical

1126
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,480
components we need to test this probably

1127
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,119
through tabletop exercises or we can

1128
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,520
test this in love environments

1129
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,760
also single point of failure if these

1130
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
critical components have one single

1131
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,319
point of failure that could be pretty

1132
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,599
dangerous they have a they have to have

1133
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,240
redundancy on it so

1134
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,200
they don't break if one fails and

1135
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,880
missing patches of course that's

1136
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,119
something worth mentioning

1137
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,599
so a little storytelling

1138
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,319
regarding a red teaming assessment we

1139
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,960
performed some years ago and that

1140
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,800
included some ics on it

1141
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,359
this assessment was for a mining

1142
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,560
industry they required to validate or to

1143
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,200
assess their response and

1144
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,599
detection capabilities against real

1145
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,880
threats

1146
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,640
real threats for them

1147
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,599
meant competitors national state actors

1148
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,319
or even

1149
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,359
organized crime yeah

1150
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,119
and even organized crime

1151
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,800
they wanted access specifically to

1152
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,240
information for for these mining in for

1153
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,839
this mine in this case

1154
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,640
so the rating goals that we crafted for

1155
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,119
this assessment

1156
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,119
was to assess

1157
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,520
the external network get access to

1158
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,319
internal network and persist for a

1159
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,760
period of time

1160
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,400
then do some lateral movement privilege

1161
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,640
escalation with the goal of accessing

1162
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,040
this critical information and also to

1163
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,760
access some scada and other critical

1164
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,599
component systems

1165
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,839
um

1166
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,079
of course to measure the detection and

1167
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,640
response capabilities they have and

1168
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,280
access to strategical data and from the

1169
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,640
operational impacts we have

1170
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,119
the client or the mind asked us to

1171
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,280
evaluate some critical components they

1172
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,760
have in place this included the

1173
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,000
monitoring of the mind the tracking

1174
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,960
systems proximity alert systems and the

1175
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,920
ventilation systems

1176
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,200
so how do we did we execute this

1177
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,400
assessment we did through two phases the

1178
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
first phase was using a css csi like

1179
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
exercise it was really reduced we don't

1180
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,520
do an extensive cyber security

1181
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,720
assessment but we did interviews we

1182
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,520
did a site a walkthrough we understand

1183
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,960
the processes they they have

1184
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,280
specifically for the four a

1185
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,520
critical process they want us to assess

1186
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,599
we needed to understand how they were

1187
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,640
operating if they have a way to prove

1188
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,440
them on love environments of if they are

1189
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,280
just in production and there was no

1190
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,960
other way to test them

1191
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,640
so for this from this phase we got a

1192
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,680
surface attack identification we

1193
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,760
understanding the

1194
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,960
yeah the

1195
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,880
organization environment and we were

1196
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,800
able to break through into individual

1197
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,160
components

1198
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,280
also

1199
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,440
for these individual components we

1200
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,400
understand that ventilation systems were

1201
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,640
out of scope because

1202
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,720
there was too much risk to test these

1203
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,520
systems online because

1204
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,000
failure of ventilation systems meant

1205
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,960
dead for the people inside the mine so

1206
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
definitely we can't test that and there

1207
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
was no lab environment or other ways to

1208
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,400
test it and we get to know this because

1209
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,079
of the previous

1210
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,400
non-intrusive engagement we do it for

1211
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,720
for the organization and then we follow

1212
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,400
with the simulations we did some

1213
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,920
wireless and physical attack testing

1214
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,559
social engineering we got logical access

1215
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,720
and we tried to move or to reach the

1216
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
information they wanted

1217
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,920
and

1218
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
for the other components for the

1219
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
proximity alert and

1220
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,440
tracking systems

1221
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,200
those systems were also critical because

1222
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,880
they were used inside the mine and

1223
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,119
failure of these systems could could

1224
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,079
cause

1225
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,160
probably not dead necessarily but yes

1226
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,920
accidents and

1227
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,760
yeah that's something that we couldn't

1228
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,880
afford

1229
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,839
however those systems could be analyzed

1230
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,640
uh offline they had these systems of

1231
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,359
line for us to analyze them so in this

1232
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,359
case that was a

1233
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,160
an attack vector

1234
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,920
and but finally some key take highways

1235
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,440
and we need to understand that it and ot

1236
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,839
are different they pose different

1237
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:10,960
challenges

1238
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,960
they have different operational goals

1239
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,599
and it is important for us if we are

1240
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,400
assessing ics industries to understand

1241
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,880
that those differences so we can provide

1242
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,280
actual value to the company

1243
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,319
um

1244
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,559
ic security assessments are similar to

1245
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,880
other security assessments but they have

1246
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,839
some

1247
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,400
different things there that we need to

1248
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,720
be careful of we need to understand the

1249
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,800
context we need to have a testing

1250
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,760
methodology and then we can start

1251
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,520
scanning or attacking

1252
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,920
as then we were mentioned we start

1253
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,359
testing passively and we escalate safely

1254
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,520
so knowing the industry and

1255
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,839
understanding what are the context of

1256
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,839
what is the context and the needs of the

1257
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,119
clients we are assessing it's

1258
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,200
necessary for us to

1259
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,040
perform an efficient risk reduction

1260
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,760
recommendations and not only ask our

1261
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,040
clients to

1262
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,119
fix everything or to include security in

1263
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,359
everything

1264
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,160
and we need to remember that rich rich

1265
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,880
of these systems probably means already

1266
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,440
game over we don't want to

1267
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,720
just

1268
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,800
came to the organization and

1269
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
tell them what they already know we need

1270
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,319
to find in

1271
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,160
different ways to provide actual value

1272
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,119
to

1273
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,800
to these clients

1274
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640
and if you want more i have some

1275
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,520
references for you some talks some

1276
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,280
documents

1277
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,480
some do it yourself things

1278
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,880
and some tooling on github

1279
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,040
and that's it if you have any questions

1280
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,119
you can pick me up twitter and

1281
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,000
or ask here

1282
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:54,400
[Applause]

1283
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,200
okay so sometimes i role play and

1284
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,400
let's start by saying

1285
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
i am not going to be attacking or

1286
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,119
critiquing his talk

1287
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,559
one of the things i tell the cavalry

1288
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,240
folks is that sometimes the opposite of

1289
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,760
a profound truth is not a lie but

1290
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,680
another profound truth and together you

1291
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,119
have a greater truth and sometimes we

1292
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,960
have cognitive dissonance

1293
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,280
so to connect this to chris hopps

1294
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,079
keynote yesterday about fragile versus

1295
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,200
resilient versus anti-fragile

1296
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
if

1297
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,040
even scanning these environments is

1298
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,520
dangerous and therefore we choose not

1299
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,520
to prove how dangerous that is

1300
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,040
because the client wouldn't want us to

1301
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,280
break things that's a truth

1302
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,359
and it's dangerous

1303
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,680
so do you believe an adversary from

1304
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
north korea russia

1305
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,200
or even an accident from a ransom crew

1306
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,599
would use kid gloves

1307
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,480
and just

1308
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,079
not actually

1309
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,240
sneeze on these things so one of the

1310
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,000
things we wrestled with at sissa and we

1311
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,800
made the sisa.gov bad practices

1312
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,240
was that the use of unsupported

1313
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,559
end-to-life software is dangerous in

1314
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,400
critical infrastructure

1315
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,880
now that is not to lack empathy for the

1316
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,880
fact that these are really old devices

1317
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,400
they are very mission critical if you

1318
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
break that mind that mind might shut

1319
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,640
down forever

1320
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,520
and

1321
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,839
if it's that fragile are we resilient

1322
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,440
that's not a rhetorical question if it's

1323
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,400
that fragile are we resilient and back

1324
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,160
to his other truth that these things

1325
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,599
once you get physical access there's no

1326
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,200
authentication you can just inject all

1327
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,880
this all the modbus traffic you want

1328
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,680
we tend to believe in an air gap

1329
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,599
and they rarely were ever there but now

1330
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,520
you every single one of your employers

1331
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,280
has a digital transformation officer

1332
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,040
who's deliberately adding remote

1333
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,359
telemetry bi-directional predictive

1334
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,440
analytics predictive maintenance

1335
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,359
to be able to avail themselves of data

1336
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,559
science and machine learning and

1337
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,119
other good things but the assumptions

1338
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,359
that were safe because of an air gap are

1339
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,720
gone

1340
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,440
so the world has changed and adversaries

1341
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,520
are now being more brazen and they are

1342
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,079
attacking water and food supply and

1343
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,559
while it is incredibly disruptive

1344
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,400
to maybe physically break some of this

1345
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,920
old equipment

1346
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,640
the only thing harder than planned

1347
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,119
change management window is unplanned

1348
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,880
change management window

1349
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,480
and during the pandemic on the vaccine

1350
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,079
supply chains we didn't have the luxury

1351
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,400
of hoping that no one would sneeze

1352
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,920
so i don't know what to do about it but

1353
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,200
what i know is when you look at a

1354
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
consultant being hired by an enterprise

1355
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,440
we're looking at the stakeholders

1356
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,200
wants and needs and fears and what's off

1357
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,640
limits

1358
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,559
but when you add in other players like

1359
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,960
actual adversaries or the people who

1360
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,800
need the water the oil and gas the

1361
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,640
electricity the timely access to patient

1362
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,200
care there's a lot more people affected

1363
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,359
so we're in a very uncomfortable space

1364
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,960
and part of what i'm asking the cavalry

1365
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,160
to do is

1366
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,839
we should not just walk past these

1367
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,720
fragile brittle unscannable systems and

1368
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,319
say that's as good as we can get there's

1369
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,440
no money

1370
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,200
and congress is increasingly getting

1371
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,800
appetite so i don't have an answer for

1372
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,480
it but take everything he shared with us

1373
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,920
which is valuable

1374
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,800
true

1375
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,440
and compare it to now what do we do

1376
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,359
when anyone can sneeze on these things

1377
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,359
or just even port scanning them may be

1378
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,480
too violent an act

1379
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,160
do you feel safe that the critical

1380
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,400
infrastructure is resilient don't know

1381
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,920
what to do about it but i want us to

1382
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,559
simmer in that discomfort

1383
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,720
thank you

1384
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,119
thank you
