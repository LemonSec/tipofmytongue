00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
memory of using or visiting a library

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,040
then

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,520

[Laughter]

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
i didn't realize people were going to be

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
so chatty

41

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
memory show of hands positive or

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
inspirational

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
negative memory don't be shy i won't be

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,239
offended anybody have a negative memory

53
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,360
all right you need to leave and i'm just

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,720
kidding

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
no no thank you for your honesty i

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
appreciate it okay so did you see it was

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
most of the room that had positive

58
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
experiences

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
now

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
if we were to ask people about their

61
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,480
experiences with information security

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
do you think most people would have warm

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
fuzzies

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
no right

65
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
librarians and infosec professionals

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,000
have a lot in common

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,640
we are both subject matter experts

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
we both provide knowledge guidance

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
instruction

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
we both understand something that can be

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
confusing or overwhelming at first

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
so why do libraries rank so favorably in

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
information security so unfavorably

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
well

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,790
that's what i'm going to try and change

76
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,080
[Music]

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
welcome to long overdue

78
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159
making infosec better through library

79
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,679
science i'm tracy maylief

80
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,400
[Applause]

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
so

82
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,640
before i became infosec sherpa

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
i was library sherpa

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
i have a master of library and

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,840
information science degree from the

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
university of pittsburgh go pitt

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
i began volunteering at my local library

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
when i was 13

89
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,360
and have worked as an academic corporate

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,000
and law firm librarian before bringing

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,959
my skills to information security

92
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,358
i'm here today to show you how we can

93
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,160
learn from the successes and failures

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
of librarians libraries and library

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,360
science as a discipline to help make

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
information security better

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,919
using my unique perspective of having a

98
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,430
foot in both worlds

99
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,639
[Music]

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
libraries have been around a lot longer

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
than information security

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,800
this is obviously a very brief sampling

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
but i'm using it to demonstrate how

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
young information security is

105
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,280
compared to other professions and

106
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
industries

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
we are still growing and changing and we

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
still have a lot of work to do on

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
ourselves now just take a look a look at

110
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
that for a second

111
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,039
look how long ago

112
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
some of the oldest libraries have been

113
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
and some of the more quote unquote

114
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
modern libraries from the 16 1700s some

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
of them are still operational today like

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
bodleian library at oxford university in

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,080
england

118
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
but information security i was kind of

119
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
grasping at straws here i decided to

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
pick first digital computer

121
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,280
you know and then then you got arpanet

122
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
and then you have cliff stole's book

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
look how recent that is

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
most of us you know the the second two

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
that's in most of our lifetimes

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
so i want you to understand that i feel

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
this comparison is just because library

128
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,919
science has been around for a really

129
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
long time and we can learn from them and

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
we have to remember that we are still a

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
young growing industry

132
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
so to get everybody up to speed i'd like

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
to give you a super quick overview of

134
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
modern library science and i'm not

135
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
kidding this is a super quick overview

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
so we got gabriel first one

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
french librarian and scholar gabriel

138
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
nade wrote advice on establishing a

139
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,919
library in 1627

140
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
and that work is considered to be one of

141
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
the earliest foundations of

142
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,039
librarianship

143
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,520
next we found out whatever the hell

144
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,720
thomas jefferson was doing in monticello

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
pause for obscure hamilton reference

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
applause break anyone anyone okay thank

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
you

148
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
he created a classification system for

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
his personal library

150
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
then

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
in the year 1800 u.s president john

152
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,479
adams improved

153
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
approved not improv approved an aca

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
congress which is considered to be the

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
beginning of the library of congress

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
quick show of hands who's been to the

157
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,600
library of congress in person

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
excellent go it is so cool it's really

159
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
cool

160
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,520
but then cut to 1814 when those pesky

161
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
brits burned down a lot of washington dc

162
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,680
do we have any british people here

163
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
right now oh okay you know what we're

164
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,319
gonna have a word later okay

165
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,319
those pesky brits burned down washington

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
dc including the books of the fledgling

167
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,319
library of congress collection

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
so what did thomas jefferson miss

169
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
second pause for hamilton reference

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
applause break okay no no we'll keep

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,350
going

172
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,440
[Music]

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
he missed nothing he was on top of it

174
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
and quote-unquote generously offered to

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
sell his private library collection to

176
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
the us government yes you heard me

177
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,000
correctly not donate but sell

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
in 1815 the u.s government paid him

179
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
roughly half a million dollars in

180
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,720
today's currency

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
uh today's value

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
for about 500 books and the information

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
system about his classification

184
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
system that he devised

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,000
once he did that his private collection

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
then became the foundation for what we

187
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,039
know today as the library of congress

188
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
and you can see a lot of his original

189
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
books in the library of congress so this

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
is how we got started with with the

191
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
libraries in america basically was

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
thomas jefferson collected books

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,479
devised his own classification system

194
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
and then generously got half a million

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,440
dollars in today's value for that

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
collection

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
but moving on i do want to say that yes

198
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
i am very well aware that this is a

199
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
super duper american-centric based

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
timeline but i am afraid that is what i

201
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,599
learned in library school

202
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
so if you do want to learn more um i do

203
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
encourage you to you know investigate on

204
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
your own and do some research but i just

205
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,279
wanted to kind of give you a quick

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
snippet to bring you up to speed to

207
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
where we are today and i am

208
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,839
acknowledging i know this is very

209
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,320
american-centric so apologies to our

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
non-us folks you do have your own very

211
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,870
robust and strong library histories

212
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,360
[Music]

213
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
another quick show of hands

214
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,680
who here has heard of the dewey decimal

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
system

216
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
okay

217
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
well sorry to burst your bubble

218
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,880
um i'm glad that you've heard of it but

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
i want to drop some harsh realities here

220
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
he was a jerk

221
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,640
i need to share some harsh realities

222
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
with you today unfortunately

223
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
one of the commonalities library science

224
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,440
and i.t and infosec in common

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
is the presence of inappropriate

226
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
behavior by pressure professionals in

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
the field yeah i went there yeah i did

228
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
so yes while noble dewey's

229
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,399
classification system did revolutionize

230
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,160
library science

231
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
it was also very flawed because of

232
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
dewey's racist and misogynist opinions

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,760
views worldview etc beliefs

234
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
librarians have been working tirelessly

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,240
as early as the 1939

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
to correct all the races and other bias

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
that were built into his system

238
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,040
presently groups like the american

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
library association have been removing

240
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,839
dewey's name from awards and continue to

241
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
improve upon the long-standing

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,680
wrongdoings of his classification system

243
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,920
but on a happier note there are other

244
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
classification systems that aren't

245
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
racist and misogynist

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
so i want to just take a minute to talk

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
about controlled vocabularies in

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,850
information security

249
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,959
[Music]

250
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,279
so dewey is not the only classification

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
system but i understand why it's the one

252
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
you're most familiar with because it's

253
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
prevalent in schools and public

254
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
libraries

255
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
but me as a law firm librarian i use

256
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
library congress

257
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
so to me the letter k means law

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,399
and i could not tell you what law was in

259
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,880
dewey decimal because i never had to use

260
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
it as a professional

261
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
uh but there's some other ones so the

262
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
medical librarians and they'll end

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
national library of medicine they have

264
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,720
mesh that they use

265
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
uh so this is something i'm very

266
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,519
passionate about is is that we we really

267
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,600
need to have my wish

268
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,440
for information security is that we have

269
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
an industry-wide infosec classification

270
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,240
system controlled vocabulary

271
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
some of what we use comes from the

272
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,240
military and we've incorporated into our

273
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
own infosec lexicon

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
but we also have some very unique

275
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
phrasing that really in my opinion

276
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
should have a ruling on whether or not

277
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
it should be used i'm looking at youth

278
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
runting and smishing i'm looking at the

279
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,959
two of yous okay

280
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
yes we have lots of resources and we

281
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
publish glossaries defining these terms

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
but what i feel like we're really

283
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
lacking in information security is a

284
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
centralized authority that makes

285
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
determinations on the validity of

286
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,959
phrases

287
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
in library science there's a publication

288
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
called the rda

289
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,200
resource description and access

290
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
when you catalog resource which

291
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
basically means the application of

292
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
descriptive metadata for that item

293
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
you consult an authority like the rda

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
so my wish for infosec is that we need

295
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
to develop a robust authority for the

296
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
language that we use

297
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,680
uh it will be less confusing for users

298
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,240
for professionals for journalists for

299
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,680
everyone

300
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
and please don't be thinking or say to

301
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
me afterwards well why don't you just do

302
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
it this is not a one-person job

303
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
i think there might be a small group of

304
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,519
individuals who contacted me once who is

305
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
trying to work towards this this is

306
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
definitely a committee and organization

307
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,839
and institutional thing this is not

308
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
something a single person can do um you

309
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,079
know you might argue well novel dewey

310
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
did it but he was a racist and

311
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,839
misogynist and he had sole control over

312
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,000
the vocabulary and look where that got

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
us so we need a diverse group of people

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,839
to give input and to be an authority

315
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,200
authoritative body to really to delegate

316
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,160
what sort of language we use

317
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,519
and now keep in mind this is also going

318
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,800
to help you communicate better with your

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,079
stakeholders

320
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
right you know if you start throwing

321
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
words around like fronting and smishing

322
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
i really hate those that's why i'm just

323
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
going to publicly shame them um

324
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
do you think the cfo on the board that

325
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
you're wanting to approve your security

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
budget is going to understand what

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
you're saying if you're just kind of

328
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,360
using slang or words that can't easily

329
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,000
be understood or defined

330
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,519
we need to come together on this and

331
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,880
that's something that i really really

332
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
want to happen so i'm putting that out

333
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,399
there

334
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
all right now i'd like to get to

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
our main course

336
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
in 1924 a librarian and mathematician in

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,839
india wrote the five laws of library

338
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,639
science now i like to keep in mind for

339
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,800
the updated interpretation the word book

340
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,440
really goes beyond just a paperback or a

341
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
hardback it can mean a digital resource

342
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
or any other offering that a library may

343
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,200
have

344
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
case in point did you know that many

345
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
libraries have 3d printers that you can

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
schedule time with at no charge it's

347
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
true you may have to bring your own

348
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
filament is that what it's called the

349
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
stuff you put in to make the thing

350
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
you may need to bring that but the

351
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
machine itself is available to be used

352
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
for free at many libraries

353
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
you can also use gardening tools you can

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680
borrow a rake if you need one you can

355
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,399
borrow household equipment libraries are

356
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,240
borrowing things so book really doesn't

357
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
exist anymore it's just resource

358
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
so in 2022 consider a book

359
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
to be some sort of resource or tool of

360
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,030
any kind

361
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,680

362
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
now

363
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
you've

364
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
you've had a chance to see here what

365
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,399
these five laws of library science are

366
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,120
i'm going to go through each one

367
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
and kind of dive in a little bit further

368
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,040
and i'm going to help draw some

369
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
correlations here to information

370
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
security because i want to emphasize how

371
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,120
much we have in common how much we can

372
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
learn from them

373
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,839
so let's dig in a little bit to the

374
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,320
first one books are for use

375
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
resources are for use how about

376
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,519
technology is for use

377
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
apps are for use devices are for use

378
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,600
your wherever c library i'm going to try

379
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,440
to just change this out with a security

380
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,320
term

381
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320

welcoming environment insert chuckles

383
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
here

384
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
your security should provide easy access

385
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
and convenience for the users do you do

386
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,519
that do people know how to contact you

387
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,800
simple as that

388
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,839
are you squirreled away in a secret room

389
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,079
in a building somewhere or are you all

390
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
distributed and nobody knows where the

391
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
centralized security team is

392
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
the primary duty of staff is a curator

393
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,639
do you know

394
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,880
all of the security components what's

395
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
going on in your your enterprise are you

396
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
working with your it teams are they

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
using insecure software and you don't

398
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
even know it are you curating all the

399
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,990
security within your enterprise

401

books are for all security is for all

technology is for all

403
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,399
the security team should provide

education for every person now you may

405
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
just think well that's just security

406
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
awareness okay but

407
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,519
do you really do a good job with your

408
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
security awareness

409
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,240
do you

410
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
treat it as

411
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
you know as a throwaway thing that

412
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
people don't care about do you mock it

413
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
do you put little value on it

414
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,759
or do you rather just spend time rolling

415
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
your eyes and making fun of all the

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
users

417
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,880
the security team needs to be

418
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
knowledgeable you need to stay on top of

419
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,160
stuff what's going on in in the news

420
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
i said this actually to

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,880
one of my bosses chris krebs of the the

422
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,040
other day i said i tell people all the

423
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
time they need to be on top of the

424
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,959
breaking news stories and you should be

425
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,079
able if asked to translate that into

426
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,480
layman's terms if asked if you're in

427
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
front of a board or front of some sort

428
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
of governing body that's trying to give

429
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
you money or give you support for your

430
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,560
security team and you can't explain to

431
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
them in easy terms what happened with

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
the colonial pipeline then you need to

433
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,519
to go back and hit the books as it were

434
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
and stay knowledgeable

435
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,199
you need to anticipate the customer's

436
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,079
needs

437
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,920
is there new tech coming out is there a

438
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
new iowa you know watch coming out are

439
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
there new issues coming out are there

440
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
new attacks coming out anticipate the

441
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,959
needs of your users

442
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
don't be knee-jerk reactions get ahead

443
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,400
of it it'll be so much easier to manage

444
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
this last one if this does not ring any

445
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,160
bells inside your head then i don't know

446
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
if i can help you

447
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,240
does access control sound familiar for

448
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,640
information security libraries have

449
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
access control too

450
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,919
it just looks different

451
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,240
there just might be books that are

452
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
behind the desk that are not in

453
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,000
circulation did you ever go to a library

454
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
catalog and you'll see something listed

455
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
as no surf or non-circ it means you

456
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,320
can't take it out because they have

457
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,799
access control because the book may be

458
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,160
valuable it may be stolen a lot it may

459
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
be rare it may be a rare book there's a

460
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
lot of times very old books that you

461
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
can't handle yourself you have to get a

462
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
skilled archivist or librarian

463
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,039
we all have access control libraries

464
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
have access control they've had access

465
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,320
control

466
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
we have access control we can learn from

467
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
them

468
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
every book has a reader

469
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
every security has a user every tech has

470
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
end user again classification system we

471
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,320
really need to get on board as an

472
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
industry as a community getting one

473
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
common language used

474
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
and please for the love of jeff stop

475
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
coming up with these new marketing terms

476
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,120
you know smishing fishing

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,360
squishing whatever all it does is

478
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,160
confuse the people using the technology

479
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
it's fishing

480
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
it's fishing just call it fishing that's

481
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,679
all it is let's give the end users one

482
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,400
term to remember and stop dividing it

483
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
out

484
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,760
i have yet to hear an argument why all

485
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,799
these duplicate terms are necessary

486
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,880
if you have one talk to me later but i

487
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
have yet to hear one other than it just

488
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,960
causes confusion

489
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,640
and what else do we have we want

490
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
awareness person to person do you

491
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
actually talk to your users do you

492
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,360
interact with them a famous story i tell

493
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
is when i first started and as a sock

494
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
analyst at a global pharmaceutical

495
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,160
company i replied to a user's email to

496
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
which she wrote back oh there's humans

497
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
in security i thought everything was

498
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
automated

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
and i turned to my manager at the time

500
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
and i said don't you talk to anybody

501
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,720
don't we talk to anybody here

502
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
you need to interact with people they're

503
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
humans we're human security at the root

504
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,440
of it is a human problem right sure

505
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
there's ones in zeros and sure there's

506
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
networks and osi models and all that

507
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,480
stuff but at the very root of it it's a

508
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,720
human problem so don't

509
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
disregard the humans in this equation

510
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
and again education offerings not only

511
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
for the the users but for the staff as

512
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,559
well is the staff up to speed

513
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
you know are you given some sort of

514
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
budget to take classes is it enough of a

515
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,440
budget to take classes these are really

516
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
critical issues and i know a lot of

517
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,679
companies feel differently about this

518
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,200
but this is something you really need to

519
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
stress or if you're trying to negotiate

520
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
for a new job make sure you get some

521
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,960
education credit in there because you

522
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
need to stay on top of stuff otherwise

523
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
you're just kind of chasing after things

524
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
and not really getting ahead of it and

525
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,960
use that terminology if you're getting

526
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
pushed back you know do you want a

527
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
security staff who's you know behind the

528
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,200
times or do you want a security staff

529
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,930
who is ahead of the wave

530
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,320
[Music]

531
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
save time for the readers and the staff

532
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
so just kind of like what i was saying

533
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
before

534
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,120
um

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,559
you know you need to save time for

536
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,559
yourselves to educate not only educating

537
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,760
the users

538
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,919
increase visibility maybe have a

539
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,760
security fair i know a lot of people

540
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
love to roll their eyes at me when i say

541
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
october cyber security awareness month

542
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
get a cake people love cake

543
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
have a cake with a lock on it or

544
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
something

545
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
do something make it visible

546
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,400
you know make security visible make it

547
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
you know we live with it in our lives

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
every day don't make it this secret

549
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
squirrel thing that you can't see that

550
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
you can't touch make it known to the

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,159
your customers your users your employees

552
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
whatever you want to call them

553
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,240
that it's a living organism that can

554
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
grow with their needs can grow with the

555
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,080
problems in the world and it's something

556
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,159
to be celebrated not feared and not

557
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
hidden away

558
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
assess readers and understand their

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
needs

560
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
so ask questions

561
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
ask them ask them what they know what

562
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
they don't know why are they doing

563
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,640
things you can do that in a way and not

564
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
sound condescending

565
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
um

566
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,240
a story that i love to tell is

567
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,400
there is uh there was a woman who every

568
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
single day reported the company-wide

569
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
newsletter as a fish

570
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,000
every single day

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
and all my co-workers would just roll

572
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,440
their eyes like there's betty again and

573
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
blah blah so i finally said did anybody

574
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
ask her why she does this

575
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
no they'd rather complain about it

576
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,799
so

577
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,679
i called her monday hi betty i'm tracy

578
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
from the security team just just a

579
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,480
question for you you know these emails

580
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
that you get the company-wide newsletter

581
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,360
i said i see that you report them as a

582
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,559
fish

583
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,679
every day

584
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
and i'm just curious as to why you do

585
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,039
that

586
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,640
her response was

587
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,320
i thought that's what i was supposed to

588
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,880
do

589
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
so somewhere there was a breakdown in

590
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
communication or instruction along the

591
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,679
way

592
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
and rather than rectify it

593
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
the team i was on at the time thought it

594
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,840
was more fun just to make fun of it

595
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,919
so when i explained to her that

596
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,640
you know this particular email

597
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
you know is safe i said but yes if you

598
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,200
do see something suspicious about it

599
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,039
then report it but just don't

600
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,120
automatically report it because you see

601
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
it coming into your inbox so i spent at

602
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,480
most maybe five minutes of my day kind

603
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,039
of going through that with her

604
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
emails disappeared

605
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,480
because she was getting the information

606
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
she needed she was misdirected she was

607
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
misguided it took five minutes out of my

608
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
life and also then in the in the long

609
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
run caused us less work because what did

610
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
the team have to do every day deal with

611
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
that email

612
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
so i just was beside myself like you

613
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
need to talk to people and that's the

614
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
librarian in me that you know you might

615
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
want to call that human if you want to

616
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,760
be in a real infosecchi about it

617
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
sometimes you can get an answer just by

618
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,039
talking to someone and i know like

619
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
picking up the phone is anathema to many

620
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
people you need to get over it that's a

621
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,120
lot of times how you get to the root of

622
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
security problems is just by talking to

623
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
someone

624
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,189
[Music]

625
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
so in the original five laws of library

626
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,200
of science

627
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
the line for this was the library is a

628
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,760
growing organism

629
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
that was updated too the library is

630
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,799
always changing

631
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,880
what's the only constant in infosec

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
change right

633
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,480
i often refer to infosec as a sisyphean

634
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
task if you're not familiar with the

635
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,120
tale of sisyphus it's the person who was

636
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,720
doomed to rolling a rock up a hill

637
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
for for the like for duration

638
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
of of all lifetime that's kind of what

639
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
it feels like right

640
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
and yeah there's a downside and i'm not

641
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
trying to all bum us out right now but

642
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,400
there's so many positives we can bring

643
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
out of that task

644
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,120
you know

645
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,919
we can we can anticipate threats coming

646
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,760
and warn people or batten down the

647
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
hatches of our network as necessary

648
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
you know consider the needs of your

649
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,200
organization do you know that your

650
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
company's looking to grow in maybe

651
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,279
another country or another state or

652
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
something get ahead of that

653
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,720
do some you know easy oh sin or threat

654
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
intelligence what sort of challenges

655
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
might you face if you try to open up a

656
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,279
call center in qatar just to throw a you

657
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,720
know country out there not picking on

658
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,400
them um watch the world cup this fall um

659
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,720
so you know it's important to plan to

660
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
plan ahead you know are there going to

661
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
be layoffs that could

662
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,880
indicate possibly insider threats you

663
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,559
know and i know that the security team

664
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,679
isn't always on top of this but this is

665
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
where your person-to-person comment uh

666
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,880
content and your human come into play

667
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
maybe put the onus on your upper-level

668
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
bosses hey

669
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
can you get looped in with hr i'd like

670
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
to know if there's maybe a mass layoff

671
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,919
coming because that could really be a

672
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,240
problem for us or if you start to see a

673
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,440
lot of exfiltration of data

674
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,520
maybe run it up the chain hey are we

675
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
about to let go a bunch of people

676
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
because i see a lot of people you know

677
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
bringing stuff out of the network

678
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
you know things are always changing so

679
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,159
you need to be on top of it and if

680
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,679
you're familiar with the ferris bueller

681
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
movie you know life moves at you fast

682
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,159
right

683
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,640
you need to stay on top of it

684
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
all right

685
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,520
let's take a minute deep breath

686
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
that was a lot of information i threw at

687
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
you right

688
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,600
so

689
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
now you know we

690
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,960
we looked at

691
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
[Music]

692
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,920
whoops

693
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,840
[Music]

694
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,440
so we looked at how we can apply the

695
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
five laws of library science to infosec

696
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,600
but i have a proposal for five laws of

697
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,879
information security

698
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,290
let's have at it

699
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,440
[Music]

700
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,960
so now you some of you may be looking at

701
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,640
these five and me thinking to yourself

702
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
well this isn't anything new this is

703
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,600
what we do now great then you're

704
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,279
better than most of the other people in

705
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,960
this space

706
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,840
but do you apply this consistently

707
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
is it updated regularly are your sops

708
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
and your playbooks updated regularly

709
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
or does one person hold the keys to all

710
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
the playbooks and then they leave the

711
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
company and then nobody knows how to do

712
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
it because

713
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
you know bob was the only one who knew

714
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,960
how to do that

715
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,120
don't hoard knowledge hoarding knowledge

716
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
doesn't make you more powerful

717
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
okay i think a lot of people confuse

718
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,320
hoarding of knowledge with with power

719
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
when all it does is make your enterprise

720
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,240
weaker if you don't share that knowledge

721
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,000
so and then do you actually practice

722
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
what you preach

723
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
does this does the security team have

724
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,799
one set of rules

725
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
always logging in as admin

726
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
but then you're admonishing others for

727
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
doing the same

728
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,520
so these five here just my suggestion

729
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,919
and this always can be improved upon

730
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,919
but the bottom line is make sure your

731
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,679
information security program has a

732
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,640
clearly defined set of purpose and

733
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
guidance that is adaptable to your users

734
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,919
needs your team's needs your

735
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,320
organization's needs and the changing

736
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,000
world around us

737
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,640
you know you may have pages and pages

738
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
again of those sops or there's playbooks

739
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,679
or there's guidelines it might be stored

740
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,279
on your internet

741
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,360
but can people actually find them

742
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
do they know where they are

743
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,520
have they been updated does it reference

744
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,000
an outdated version of an iphone do you

745
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
think anybody's going to take security

746
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
advice seriously if you're referring to

747
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,440
a zoom

748
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
on on your site

749
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,320
and do you have something succinct in a

750
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
in layman's terms that people can follow

751
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,919
sure you may have more advanced users

752
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,520
then guess what then you can create a

753
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
second set set of instructions how many

754
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
times i know that i've run into this

755
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
when you try to discuss security with

756
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,000
one of the it folks who

757
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
because they're in i.t think they know

758
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,159
as much or more than you

759
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,159
especially me being a woman

760
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,440
in security

761
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,200
well they don't

762
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
because security is my job not theirs

763
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,120
so fine if you need to create a more

764
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,039
high-tech level

765
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
explanation to account for those people

766
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
do it

767
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
do it don't fight them they're just

768
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
they're they're going to look down on

769
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,559
you no matter what

770
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,640
so you know what if you want them to be

771
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,799
secure speak to them in their language

772
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,640
if you want the less tech savvy people

773
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,320
to be more secure speak to them in their

774
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,520
language it's not one size fits all

775
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,679
library science information security

776
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,760
growing organisms you need to grow and

777
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,919
morph and change to serve the different

778
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,360
needs of the users you have

779
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,760
so what do you think thumbs up thumbs

780
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
down do you think that five laws of

781
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,159
information security could work right

782
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
awesome

783
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
any thumbs down anybody who wants to

784
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
like huff out of here you're kind of on

785
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,919
the fence i i get it no i get you i got

786
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:16,799
you

787
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,080
it's hard

788
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
i'm sorry i can't hear you

789
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,159
okay thank you yes

790
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,679
yeah and the ones that i came up with

791
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,440
may not be perfect

792
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
you know i'm just kind of spitballing

793
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,799
here because then this goes back to we

794
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
need that authoritative body we need

795
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,840
more input this needs more work but i'm

796
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
introducing something brand new here

797
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,600
this is a first draft but i want you to

798
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
think about this and if we can't do this

799
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
as a community do it for your own

800
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,039
enterprise do it for your own

801
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,480
organization

802
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,039
[Music]

803
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,158
but wait there's more

804
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,840
okay

805
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
one other thing i want to cover is the

806
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,390
reference interview

807
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,000
[Music]

808
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
but

809
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,399
spoiler alert

810
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,440
i have given this talk many times and i

811
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,200
am not going to go into it again today

812
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
because this itself is an hour long talk

813
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
this is actually a slide from one of the

814
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
early versions of the talk that that

815
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,120
i've given so

816
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,520
uh most notably i've given this talk

817
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
empathy as a service to create a culture

818
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,399
of security at derby con 2019 i was one

819
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,679
of the speakers at the very last

820
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,880
derbycon

821
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
which side note i was stunned when they

822
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399
accepted my talk because i thought that

823
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
was a very highly technical conference

824
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,279
but as it turns out highly technical

825
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,520
people need to need to know what empathy

826
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
is and how to apply it

827
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,039
so i was very pleased how well my talk

828
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,720
went over there and then i was also a

829
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,399
keynote speaker for the diane initiative

830
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,279
in 2020 for this talk

831
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,520
so you can view my full talk

832
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
um either one derby con or die

833
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
initiative on youtube

834
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,799
i do have the my last slide i have a

835
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,120
link to my link tree which all my talks

836
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
will be posted there

837
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,559
don't watch it now just watch it later

838
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,559
make some popcorn it's good

839
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,640
but for those of you who have not seen

840
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,799
this talk or heard about the reference

841
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,720
interview before i'm going to go over a

842
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,880
quick rundown of what each of these

843
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,519
steps means so this is a seven step

844
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,200
procedure that is often used in

845
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,360
libraries called the reference interview

846
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,600
as a way to really get to the root of

847
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
what a user needs what a user wants

848
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,039
so one approachability

849
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,960
are people in your organization scared

850
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
to report that they clicked on a fish

851
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
or are they scared to report

852
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
and you're scared to approach the

853
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
security team in general

854
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
guess what you have an approachability

855
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,440
problem and you need to fix it now i'm

856
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
not saying you go out and you give you

857
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,080
know

858
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,399
hugs and you know

859
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,480
unicorns and pink bunnies and all that

860
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,080
stuff you don't have to swing the

861
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,640
pendulum that way be a human

862
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
be empathetic understand that security

863
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,200
is not their job it's yours and these

864
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,799
things can be very scary and

865
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,640
intimidating you need to have an

866
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
approachability factor there's so many

867
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,640
stories i could tell you and i'll just

868
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
tell you one very quickly how

869
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,799
approachability saved one of the and the

870
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,480
companies i worked for

871
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,760
uh somebody from the marketing

872
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
department said we're going to have the

873
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,399
cmo of this insert really popular app

874
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,200
here

875
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,679
um talk to our marketing team and of

876
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,840
like 200 folks

877
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,640
and i want them all to download

878
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,840
their new

879
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,679
app that they're going to release so

880
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,000
that we can all you know

881
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,440
you know make it a good impression on

882
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,200
the person blah blah blah

883
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,120
but they were too afraid to submit it to

884
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,799
the general security

885
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,679
email so this came to me directly

886
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,080
and i said let me look into that app for

887
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,960
you

888
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,799
oh it took me all of like two minutes to

889
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,200
go oh hell no no

890
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,919
here this is a very insecure product and

891
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,720
we are not doing this so you know i did

892
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
not admonish her i just i just laid it

893
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
out to her look these are the

894
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,360
insecurities i do not advise this i

895
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,279
really do not want you know please do

896
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,880
not encourage people to download this

897
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,760
um

898
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,279
long story short i got in trouble for

899
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,679
handling something independently but i

900
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,679
made the right call that's another talk

901
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,840
for drinks another time

902
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,440
but

903
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
i was approachable

904
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
i solved a potential problem that could

905
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
have been huge we would have had 250

906
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,000
people downloading an insecure product

907
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,440
and using it and then probably

908
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
forgetting about it and leaving that

909
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,919
insecure app on the network and because

910
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
i was approachable i was able to nip

911
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
that in the bud

912
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,799
i still take pride in that even though i

913
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,399
got in trouble

914
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,799
interest care about your job

915
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
if you don't like being in this industry

916
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,559
there's so many other jobs out there i

917
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
just i really have disdain for people

918
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
with a bad attitude it really just

919
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
irritates me i made a choice to come

920
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
into infosec okay i want to be here i

921
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,480
want to help people and i think you

922
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,679
should too

923
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,519
take an interest in solving the problems

924
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,760
not pushing them aside

925
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,679
you know i mentioned earlier betty right

926
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,320
because just kept submitting the daily

927
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
wrap-up of the company you know blindly

928
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,799
because she thought she was supposed to

929
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,960
i took an interest in her problem

930
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
solved it and also gave her some other

931
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,879
fishing tips along the way

932
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,560
you'll be surprised how much taking an

933
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,719
interest in your users can actually

934
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,560
eliminate a lot of the problems you see

935
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,879
on your network

936
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,320
listening

937
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
train yourself to listen for what people

938
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
don't say yes what they don't say

939
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
for example

940
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,839
oftentimes i have what an employee say

941
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,918
to me i got an email

942
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,599
i clicked on a link

943
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,760
it went to this weird-looking website

944
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,918
and now i'm calling you

945
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,119
okay let's

946
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,719
let's rewind the tape there for a second

947
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,719
so i asked a very pointed question well

948
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,960
what happened between you looking at the

949
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,679
weird website and you calling me oh well

950
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,359
it asked me to fill in my username and

951
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,199
password and then it didn't do anything

952
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
so i called you

953
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,159
okay well your password is now

954
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,040
compromised so i'm glad you called

955
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,119
and um did not say those words exactly

956
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,720
but

957
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,960
you know so but why didn't they say that

958
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
either they didn't know it was important

959
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,960
because security is my job and not

960
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
theirs

961
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,760
maybe they were embarrassed maybe they

962
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
knew they did something wrong and they

963
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,520
were too ashamed or didn't know how to

964
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,440
phrase it

965
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
but again through approachability and

966
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,599
through listening to what they didn't

967
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,480
say

968
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
i was able to piece together what

969
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,560
happened and was very quickly able to

970
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
block off their account change the

971
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,520
password so we didn't have an issue

972
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
you know and

973
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,560
you know you need to understand that a

974
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,280
lot of times users don't know what is

975
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,599
important to us so this is why you need

976
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,839
to train yourself to listen for what

977
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,920
they don't say and and a lot of people

978
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
have problems and struggle with this and

979
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,280
ask me for assistance

980
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,119
so this is a guideline i can offer you

981
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,880
that might help

982
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,720
you know the checklist in your head how

983
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,880
to remediate an issue if you don't know

984
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
it in your head then physically you know

985
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,760
write it down or type it somewhere

986
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,440
take off the boxes

987
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,280
when they mention things

988
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,800
if there's some there's a if there's a

989
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,119
box left until that's when you circle

990
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,280
back and you ask the specific question

991
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,440
to get that box ticked and it may be

992
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,359
nothing they may just be saying oh yeah

993
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,680
i just closed it i didn't do anything

994
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,280
okay but you didn't they didn't say that

995
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,440
so rather than have an unknown

996
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,079
just ask

997
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
interviewing

998
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,320
so while it's good to be you know good

999
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,800
at listening

1000
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
again circle back and ask those

1001
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,720
questions in a non-threatening way

1002
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,560
non-mocking way

1003
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
you're not out to humiliate someone

1004
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
you're there to troubleshoot

1005
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
ask specific questions to get the

1006
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,440
answers you need to fix the problem

1007
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
you know and sometimes you do get

1008
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,240
resistance one time i i knew for a fact

1009
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040

1041
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,200

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
have story time remember librarian

1043
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
aspect we'll do

1044
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
all these little little tidbits of story

1045
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,280
time

1046
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
i was working late one night i saw one

1047
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
of the uh computers in europe was going

1048
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,720
nuts you know lighten up lighten up the

1049
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,880
enterprise and lighten up the network

1050
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,720
and because of the time of day it was

1051
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,359
over there i was like oh this is sketchy

1052
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,280
um i looked up who the user was

1053
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,520
immediately it was a security guard okay

1054
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,960
it's probably an overnight security

1055
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
guard they were downloading a bunch of

1056
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,920
stuff

1057
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,560
reached out using the company you know

1058
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,640
chat internal chat system

1059
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
not getting any answers it dawns on me

1060
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
this person might not speak english

1061
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,560
so

1062
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
i went to an online translator

1063
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,720
the very first sentence was i am using

1064
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
an online translator and then proceeded

1065
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,359
to ask my questions

1066
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,839
response right away in that and not in

1067
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,680
that non-english language

1068
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,160
throw it into the translator went back

1069
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,000
and forth

1070
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,560
he was just bored downloading photos i

1071
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,000
asked him to stop he did he was so sorry

1072
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and i then walked him through using the

1073
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,359
translator

1074
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,440
how to you know run the antivirus and

1075
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,839
all that stuff all these things remotely

1076
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,960
done

1077
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,599
you know i didn't panic i didn't think

1078
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
this this is it this is it the russians

1079
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
took over the network

1080
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
you know look into stuff you you know

1081
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
and then had that thought of oh he might

1082
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,520
not speak english

1083
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,359
you know do things like that but also i

1084
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,720
stress if you're going to use an online

1085
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
translator tell the person you're using

1086
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,079
an online translator because it doesn't

1087
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,240
really translate exactly well and it

1088
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,920
might look really strange to them and

1089
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,079
that might also give them pause

1090
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,760
but also also that's why i use the

1091
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,240
internal messaging system but again he

1092
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,000
knew okay she's using an online

1093
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
translator this is why the language

1094
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,079
looks very strange

1095
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,359
to me

1096
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,800
so answering

1097
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
what does your correspondence or

1098
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
messages look like to the you know to

1099
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,839
your consumers

1100
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,560
um you know do you sign off do you have

1101
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,720
you know a sig file or do they know that

1102
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
they're corresponding with the manager

1103
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,760
or a sock analyst and that's not like an

1104
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
elitist thing but if you're an end user

1105
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
experiencing a problem i kind of like to

1106
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
know who i'm dealing with you know i

1107
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:04,880
know i'm gonna start i'm gonna make a

1108
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
bad joke here but yeah i need to speak

1109
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,319
to a manager well yeah because maybe

1110
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,160
maybe you're not really getting anywhere

1111
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,240
with someone and you know that's maybe

1112
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,000
that's a fair assessment maybe that

1113
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
analyst doesn't care about their job and

1114
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,760
maybe isn't doing all these steps that

1115
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,520
we're talking about today

1116
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
so you know again how do how do you tell

1117
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,880
your internal customers

1118
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
you know that you're working on things

1119
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,800
for them i in my talk again i don't give

1120
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,079
too many spoilers because i want you to

1121
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,839
watch my original talk but i give a

1122
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,520
sample of an email that two sentences

1123
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,760
convey four very pieces important pieces

1124
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
of information it acknowledges the

1125
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
person's problem it told them you know

1126
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,280
when to expect an answer you know it it

1127
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
acknowledged what the issue was things

1128
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,520
like that so is your car your

1129
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,040
correspondence doesn't have to be pages

1130
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,560
and pages long

1131
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
it you know it just has to be succinct

1132
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,599
and give information i know that i as a

1133
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,040
customer would feel so much better

1134
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
having a two-sentence email that had

1135
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,599
four pieces of information to know oh i

1136
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,200
can expect to hear back from them by the

1137
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
end of the day tomorrow they know that i

1138
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
reported a suspicious email they know

1139
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
who i am

1140
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
i know who i'm talking to that would put

1141
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,280
me at ease

1142
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,800
and then follow up

1143
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
are these solutions you put into place

1144
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
actually working no no i don't expect

1145
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
you to follow up with every single betty

1146
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
in your organization but can you just

1147
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,839
tell by looking at your logs or things

1148
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,520
that you put in place working are you

1149
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,160
still having the same amount of false

1150
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,839
positives or

1151
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,280
or you know

1152
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,599
all other indicators you know are these

1153
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,359
things working do you really check up on

1154
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,680
this or if you do have an individual

1155
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,920
frequent flyer who always contacts

1156
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
security do you check up with them

1157
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,720
periodically um you know that those

1158
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,160
things are important because they you

1159
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,839
know some people might need a little

1160
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,839
extra hand holding and yes some of those

1161
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,880
people might be executives okay um you

1162
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,240
know if you have an executive who

1163
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,359
travels around the world a lot you know

1164
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:02,880
are they going to different countries

1165
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
like oh have we scanned your phone since

1166
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,839
you got back from vietnam uh we should

1167
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,680
probably do that

1168
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,520
um you know are you following up on

1169
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,599
things this is another way that you can

1170
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,920
you know get ahead of potential problems

1171
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,359
and really nip them in the bud through

1172
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,839
follow-up

1173
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:20,800
so

1174
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,440
i'm going to start to wrap this up now

1175
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
so what did we learn today

1176
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,839
we can learn from library science

1177
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,359
that you know there are so many

1178
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,560
applicable lessons and failures to be

1179
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
learned but let's let's talk about the

1180
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,880
lessons and the positives

1181
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,319
raise your quick show hands do you feel

1182
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,760
like you've learned something new today

1183
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,960
that you can apply to information

1184
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
security you feel like you've learned

1185
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,200
something excellent

1186
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,560
there's a lot we can learn there's still

1187
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,319
more we can learn please go back and

1188
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,160
watch my empathy as a service to create

1189
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,240
a culture security like i said that that

1190
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,920
whole talk is just about the reference

1191
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,599
interview and i go in a lot deeper with

1192
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,560
that

1193
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,480
we could really use five laws of

1194
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
information security as a guideline we

1195
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,440
could really use a standard vocabulary

1196
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
these are things we need to work towards

1197
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,200
as an industry and as a community

1198
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
and just

1199
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,319
talk look at all these things that we

1200
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,160
went through today and yes i'll figure

1201
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,040
out how to get my slides posted but

1202
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,599
use the reference interview techniques

1203
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,839
to adapt them to your particular

1204
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,079
situation i know it's not one size fits

1205
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,720
all remember the library and security is

1206
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,640
a growing organism

1207
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
change them as you need to but have some

1208
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,280
guidelines in mind you know

1209
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,960
at the very root of it security is

1210
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,280
human-centric and we need to think about

1211
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,599
it that way that's what the library did

1212
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,200
the library knows that it's dependent

1213
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,319
upon users they keep all kinds of stats

1214
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,319
about their um you know their

1215
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,319
circulation and who comes through the

1216
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,119
door

1217
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,400
and all that stuff because that's how

1218
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,839
they get their money a lot of times

1219
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,520
based on grants

1220
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,040
so think of it that way you need to

1221
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,440
think of the human element how you can

1222
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,500
improve security

1223
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,160
[Music]

1224
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,440
so

1225
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,280
i kind of already asked this already but

1226
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
just last show of hands everybody feel

1227
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,520
good about this you feel like you

1228
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,119
library science can help us in the

1229
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,800
future everybody feel good

1230
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,319
excellent all right you've been a

1234
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,280
my talks and articles and things like

1235
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,570
that on my link tree thanks for coming

1236
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,649
[Applause]

1237
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,440
and i'm happy to take questions and

1238
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,580
whatnot

1239
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,880
[Music]

1240
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,440
yes in the back

1241
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
can you come to the mic i'm sorry it's

1242
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,599
really hard to hear

1243
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,839
so in uh i feel there's a term

1244
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,400
uh which is relevant but

1245
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,160
translating the term from a technical

1246
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,560
definition for people who are working in

1247
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,119
the space to a non-technical definition

1248
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,800
for

1249
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,160
executives and policy people

1250
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,000
there's a big disconnect in how what

1251
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,079
they actually end up hearing like they

1252
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,079
don't understand they are thinking one

1253
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,720
thing and we're thinking completely

1254
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,839
um

1255
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,000
what's the best way to reconcile the

1256
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,760
fact that the technical definition i

1257
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,440
mean how big of an organization are we

1258
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,720
talking is it something that you can

1259
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,839
actually have like head like

1260
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,040
face-to-face meetings or too big too big

1261
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,839
okay

1262
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,560
um can you have it do you have a carved

1263
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,800
out piece on the internet that people

1264
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
can go to where you can establish

1265
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,800
these

1266
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,880
these explanations and terms and like

1267
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,800
make a big deal about drawing people to

1268
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,680
it

1269
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,599
um

1270
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,200
there is well

1271
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,760
there's a lot of competing people but

1272
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,280
they're all trying to explain it to

1273
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,880
executives and the executives are like

1274
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,359
we got it you're like you didn't get it

1275
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,598
um

1276
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,280
is there is there somebody at the

1277
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,400
company who has an authority to oversee

1278
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,880
like language and stuff like that so i

1279
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,640
don't have all the answers i know this

1280
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,480
is a this is a thing of like

1281
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,240
the community as a whole has this

1282
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,760
problem yeah it's at every single

1283
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,800
company it's that like government's got

1284
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,040
buying

1285
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,119
a little bit i don't apologize i don't

1286
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,720

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,040
but um if you want to um like maybe just

1288
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,040
like tweet that question at me

1289
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,800
um i can give it some thought maybe like

1290
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,640
write a blog post about it or something

1291
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,839
thank you sorry i couldn't answer off

1292
