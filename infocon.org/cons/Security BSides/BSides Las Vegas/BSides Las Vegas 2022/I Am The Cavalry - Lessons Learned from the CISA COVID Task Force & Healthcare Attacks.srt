1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,520
as i indicated if you're in the first

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,360
session the sistakova task force was

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,640
designed and implemented by a bunch of

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,319
cavalry folks um

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,400
after chris krebs director krebs asked

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
us to come in and serve we did not know

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,599
everyone we're going to inherit many of

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,759
them were very different backgrounds

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
just by show of hands how many of the

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,720
three of you consider yourself to be

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,630
hackers

12
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,439
[Laughter]

13
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,359
sorry did i laugh out loud i would say

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,279
they're all wrong they're incredible

15
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,960
hackers but uh

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
but the mission is to

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,320
preserve trust and to save lives and

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,920
these three helped ensure we do it and

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
there's no way we could have saved the

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
lives we did on a daily basis

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
but for their skills so we have an

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
infectious disease expert on the end

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,960
reverse order michelle holco uh

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
we designed a whole new doctrine of

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,559
ball bearings to find the strategically

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,719
weak links in the supply chains and but

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,239
for her medical expertise and reuben

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,520
pasternak and others who couldn't be

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,960
here we wouldn't have known who to

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
protect

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
um lisa young brought some steps some

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
true risk management and data science

33
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
and critical infrastructure experience

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,080
and systems thinking and a voice of

35
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,080
reason to help up level the national

36
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
risk management center

37
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,479
um

38
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,439
kendra our my my uh

39
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,040
she deserves a purple heart for putting

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
up with josh uh yes um

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
she completed me uh

42
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,600
there there came a point where i

43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,759
couldn't even read anymore we had to

44
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,200
write and read

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
real high consequence things together on

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
a zoom on a you know video chat just to

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
make sure we never stop the mission and

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,079
people got tired at different points

49
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,000
kendra never got tired every single day

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,759
was right there with us trying to save

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
lives and succeeding

52
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,119
so kendra i don't even know what how to

53
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,680
describe you but kendra made

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,920
everything come together and ran one of

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
the the risk management cells um and

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
helped me hack around government

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,920
bureaucracy to get the right thing done

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
um this is a small slice of the team uh

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
there are other govis that helped us

60
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
like dominak and tom lar in the room

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
beau joined ion islam joined

62
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
um other hackers that don't like to have

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
their names slaunted joined some data

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,119
scientists joined but we had a pretty

65
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719
large and growing team i think we had

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
100 people at our peak

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
but i would like you to take a moment

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
including spanky who's somewhere around

69
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
here from the aerospace village there's

70
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,879
spanky spanky

71
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,239
i'm not going to tell you your official

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,120

please just give them a round of

77
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
applause for saving lives and keeping

you guys safe

79
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,139

okay

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,519
boy i guess that made it worth the trip

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
out to vegas thank you josh

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,680
um so what i'm going to do is i'm going

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
to give you kind of a quick what and why

85
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
of what we'll be talking about even

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
though josh did some of that earlier

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
this morning um and then

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
give you an overview of our agenda for

89
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
today but basically what we're doing is

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
kind of

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
building on josh's intro of

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,400
why

93
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
the i am the cavalry approach

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
what we were doing in the covet task

95
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,560
force within sisa primarily the the main

96
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
point being that ransomware attacks

97
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
indirectly contributed to factors that

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
led to excess deaths during covet

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,519
without question

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
we looked at these cyber attacks on

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
hospital systems that resulted in

102
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
inaccessible patient records disrupted

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,400
communications delays in processing test

104
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,319
results and we'll go into those kind of

105
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,440
details

106
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,599
during the presentation

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
but due to the increased stress on the

108
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,959
health care industry

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,280
hospitals did during the time of the

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
covered task force and continue

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,519
to have kind of this increased risk of

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
ransomware attacks

113
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
the pandemic's still going on we we act

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
like it was over we shut down the

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
coveted task force but this is

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
an issue we're going to continue to deal

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
with and so cisa

118
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
we were able to take the opportunity of

119
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,000
the task force of the agility of kind of

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
this new group that nobody even really

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
knew who we were or where we were

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
and we could plead

123
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
ignorance to process and and we just

124
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
knew we had to get certain things done

125
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,079
and so

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
cisa really had this opportunity to kind

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,639
of increase industry cyber preparedness

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,040
and resilience both related to health

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
care but also to

130
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,479
broader

131
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
private private sector work

132
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,479
um through the coveted task force so

133
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,560
to walk us through all of this uh josh

134
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
already introduced it'll be michelle

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
lisa and i

136
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
michelle is going to talk a lot about

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
the work of operation warp speed the

138
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
ball bearings worked how we helped to

139
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
identify who were the critical people

140
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,479
because we couldn't get to everybody but

141
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
where along the supply chain did we need

142
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,960
to focus our efforts

143
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,639
lisa is going to talk about the health

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
care portion and really the journey of

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
the provide medical care work we did

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
which resulted in

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
publishing our statistics and our

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
analysis about

149
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
the impact on the health care sector and

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,560
um the impact on

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
excess deaths

152
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,759
and then i'm going to end up with a very

153
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
high level i'm not a cyber person i

154
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
didn't raise my hand as a hacker

155
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,199
but i'm going to talk about the cyber

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,560
tools and the work we did which

157
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,039
we took we took the opportunity of the

158
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
task force to develop

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
and then we're able to transition into

160
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
steady state cisa we were able to give

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
those tools to our cybersecurity

162
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
division to continue to work on sharing

163
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
those not just again with health care

164
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
but with broader critical infrastructure

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
water energy everybody out there

166
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
um and i am one of the few people from

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,080
the koba task force who decided that the

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,639
mission felt like something i should

169
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
stay and do so i'm actually now

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
a permanent guvie

171
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
um and and you know i'm with this unable

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,639
to continue i hope well the work of the

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,319
kobe task force and what we did in the

174
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,000
cyber area

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,919
um so first just in case you haven't

176
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,160
heard me repeat it several times

177
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
a little bit about cisa and it is

178
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
pronounced sisa

179
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,800
um

180
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
it's still we're really the the newest

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
agency in the federal space we just

182
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,639
celebrated three years

183
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,520
and

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
we are the nation's risk reducer we look

185
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
to lead the national effort to

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
understand manage and reduce risk to

187
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
both cyber and physical infrastructure

188
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,680
what i think is really important to the

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
covet effort is that sista does a lot of

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,759
work at the federal level and working

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
with the state's local tribal and

192
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
territorial government and

193
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,759
municipalities

194
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
i think the covid work was a really

195
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
great example of the private public

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
partnership and how we can work with the

197
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,639
private sector more closely

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
in a more decentralized fashion working

199
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,039
with smaller companies particularly

200
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,360
working with small and medium

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
sized um

202
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,520
indoor enterprises

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
so like that today's agenda we'll start

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
with michelle kind of talking about the

205
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
 coveted task force what we did

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
initially the initial work that set the

207
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,919
stage for everything we're doing

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
move into health care at risk and then

209
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
tackle a little bit about the um

210
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
cyber threats

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
so

212
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
with that we'll turn to michelle awesome

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
okay can you guys hear me fine okay

214
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,160
awesome so it's nice to be here it's

215
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,319
great to meet all of these people in

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,400
person for the first time

217
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,639
um after working together for you know

218
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,560
over two years it's really incredible

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,520
and i am absolutely not a hacker um

220
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,319
although i can play one on tv um i'm a

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,400
scientist by training i have a phd in

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
genetics and i've worked a lot in the

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
bioinformatics space both both for

224
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
cancer biology as well as infectious

225
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,280
diseases

226
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
and actually the majority of my career

227
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
i've been in the public sector so after

228
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,520
my post-doctoral fellowship i was a

229
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
staff scientist at nih helping them with

230
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
their databases

231
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
and promoting reuse and re-analysis of

232
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
data that have been publicly funded

233
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
so again you know getting the most out

234
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,479
of the of the data um and then i was in

235
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
the private sector um as a contractor

236
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
but contracted back to the government

237
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
and worked at darpa in the biological

238
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,199
technologies office um so the office was

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,039
one year old at that time

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,960
and one of the major thrusts was the

241
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
prevent the next pandemic portfolio and

242
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
i was the technical lead for a lot of

243
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
the programs under that umbrella we were

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
funding moderna at the time we were

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
looking at wearables and signals from

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
wearables and how those could be

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
useful for presymptomatic detection of

248
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,680
infection

249
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
and so there was a lot of you know like

250
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
biosecurity biosafety angle to it but it

251
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
was all about um you know pandemic

252
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,279
prevention and getting left of boom so

253
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
if you look at the epidemic curve

254
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
whenever there's a there's an epidemic

255
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,279
going on um you know you get a really

256
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,440
strong growth curve and that starts

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
really early on so the farther you can

258
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
get left of that really strong

259
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
exponential growth curve the better

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,399
you're going to be and the um

261
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,279
okay um so the better off we're going to

262
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
be in terms of

263
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
saving lives and preventing preventing

264
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
death and epidemic spread

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,160
so all of that to say um then i went

266
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
back into the government as a white

267
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
house presidential innovation fellow

268
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
and was working with the nih all of us

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
research program

270
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,440
when covet hit

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
so i was working with that program

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
from october of 2019

273
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
and then covet hit and i and you know

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
because i had been working in the

275
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
pandemic space really strongly at darpa

276
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
you know and also coupled with the fact

277
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
that there were very few scientists in

278
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
government at that moment you might be

279
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,480
surprised to hear um ostp was kind of a

280
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
grave uh graveyard um and and lots of

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
empty offices there um so there were

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
very few you know federal officials that

283
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
really had the expertise um that was

284
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
necessary to push forward push things

285
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,160
forward um and so because of that i

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
started to talk to others in other

287
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,760
agencies and figure out like how i could

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
help um and one of the connections um

289
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
was made to um then head of the nrmc the

290
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
national risk management center at cisa

291
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,680
steve curran um and he um he and i had a

292
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
conversation about you know the need to

293
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
really have that kind of expertise when

294
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
we think about the risks associated with

295
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
the pandemic and so because of that only

296
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
because of that like random connection

297
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,399
and it was actually through one of my

298
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,279
kids

299
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
best friends in kindergarten's parents

300
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
is um steve curran's um

301
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
brother-in-law or sister-in-law which is

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,920
like totally random but i was just

303
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
complaining to her one day that i felt

304
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,120
like you know the work that i wasn't was

305
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
doing wasn't really uh very integrated

306
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,360
with the pandemic um made that

307
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
connection and so steve brought me on

308
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,920
board and it was literally um you know

309
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
the the first few days of of that was um

310
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
was challenging because

311
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,839
this is awesome

312
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
are you bringing

313
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
so if anybody is not familiar we have a

314
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
position here where speakers are allowed

315
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
to make a outrageous speaker request for

316
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
basically anything

317
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
and then i get to be an evil genie if i

318
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,720
want to and

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,079
we're going here but this time i'm just

320
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
playing it straight so you've all

321
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
uh been uh

322
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
authorized to come

323
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
grab some of these i'll just pass them

324
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
around whatever

325
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,480
uh dove promises in various different

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
flavors

327
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,000
thank you so much so if you don't know

328
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
well thank you thank you

329
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
if you don't know the reason i made the

330
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,519
request is you know one chocolate really

331
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,399
but dove promises if you don't know this

332
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
inside the wrapper there's a little nice

333
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
saying that tells you something positive

334
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
about yourself

335
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,880
which

336
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
we should have had them every day during

337
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
the government task force but it's just

338
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,279
a nice way to to remember you know

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,040
you're here with the i am the cavalry

340
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
session and so when you eat your dove

341
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
chocolate and even if you don't like

342
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,079
chocolate make sure you check the

343
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
wrapper and just give you a nice little

344
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,639
reminder about how special each and

345
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
every one of us is yes

346
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,120
awesome this is fantastic um so

347
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
i wanted to start by just kind of

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
telling you the story about how this

349
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
whole sisakova task force kind of came

350
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,920
to be

351
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,839
and it wasn't anything that was

352
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
intentional initially

353
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,839
and it really started i think

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
on the first meeting that josh corman

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
joined i had been there for about a

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
month and we were in this space of

357
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
trying to figure out what to do with all

358
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,279
of these lists of companies and entities

359
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
that the federal government and our

360
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
international federal partners

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
thought were important to protect during

362
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,760
the pandemic and so this very first

363
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,160
meeting was kind of a mess

364
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
we were literally just talking about

365
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,959
this list um and all of these companies

366
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
on the list and how were we going to

367
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,959
prioritize this list was over a thousand

368
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
companies big right and so cisa did not

369
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
have the ability to provide cyber

370
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
security services to all of them at the

371
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
same time it's a very kind of limited

372
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
team um and so we needed to figure out

373
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
like who were we going to protect and

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
how were we going to do that um and so

375
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
we were talking about what does the list

376
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
look like who where did the list come

377
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,959
from there were a lot of different

378
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
contributors to the list um and then we

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
started talking about like well what's

380
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
on the list and um and josh day one

381
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
was like you know i think we need to

382
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
think about this from the perspective of

383
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
ball bearings in world war ii and if you

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
want a bigger description of that from

385
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
josh later you know find him and buy him

386
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,600
a drink and he'll tell you the

387
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
long-winded version of that um but the

388
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,399
concept is like instead of just taking

389
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
this list at faith and trying to work

390
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
our way through it we needed to figure

391
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
out how to prioritize the entities and

392
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,639
get to the ones that were the most

393
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
critical and had the most potential

394
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,000
impact first um and so that's how that

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
all started um and it literally started

396
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
on josh's day one in the government um

397
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
and you know he was um you know he was

398
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
very open with sharing the fact that

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
chris krebs had asked him to come in and

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,480
to do this um

401
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,600
um so so anyway so all of that to say we

402
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,560
um there was no method um that we

403
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
started with it wasn't like someone said

404
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,320
oh here here's the method to use you

405
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
know to our data scientists um to

406
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,880
prioritize the the list and so we had to

407
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
come up with something um and i think

408
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
one of the things that i learned

409
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,399
throughout this process is

410
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
something is better than nothing um we

411
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
had nothing and we had to get to

412
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,279
something and so and it really did cr

413
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,600
it required this interdisciplinary

414
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,079
approach to it you know so we had you

415
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
know josh kind of at the strategic

416
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
thinking level um you know i was kind of

417
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
the biotech

418
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,279
subject matter expert we had reuben

419
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,440
pasternak who's an md by training an

420
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,199
emergency um emergency physician

421
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
and his level of expertise um and and

422
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,480
then

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,320
one of the things that we also started

424
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,079
to come to um

425
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,920
and you know the the task force really

426
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
came a little bit after we had kind of

427
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
gotten to us a

428
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
a baseline of what this was going to

429
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,560
look like

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
then we started to realize that

431
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
we also needed to think about things um

432
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
in a less narrow focus right and so

433
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
we we had this slide that we're not

434
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,480
showing you today but basically to kind

435
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,120
of

436
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,079
capture

437
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,240
where the these entities were coming

438
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,639
from in terms of prior priorities so

439
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
there were operation warp speed um

440
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
entities so all of the companies that

441
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,519
were directly funded um yeah you can

442
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,920
leave it on the previous slide for now

443
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,720
um

444
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
so there were all of the operation warp

445
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,920
speed entities which basically any any

446
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
uh organization who got federal funding

447
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
to participate in operation warp speed

448
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
they were developing vaccines

449
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
therapeutics and diagnostics um so all

450
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,240
of those entities and any of their

451
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,519
partners

452
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,519
were all on those lists

453
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,720
there were also kind of adjacencies to

454
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
those types of products so whenever

455
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
you're doing research around vaccine

456
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,279
development you need a lot of different

457
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,680
materials to you know do the cell cell

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
culture and testing so things like mouse

459
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
embryonic fibroblasts and um you know

460
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,639
bovine growth hormone or uh

461
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,720
lots of different um lots of different

462
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
you know biomedical tools um in in the

463
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
that might not be directly funded but

464
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
they're that are going to be really

465
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,520
critical to being able to do that work

466
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
um so there was like the operation warp

467
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,799
speed there was the warp speed adjacent

468
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,799
type stuff and then we started thinking

469
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,640
about the healthcare

470
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
delivery in general you know so once we

471
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,959
got to the point where we had vaccines

472
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,559
to deliver were we going to have enough

473
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,559
syringes were we going to have enough

474
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,960
gloves you know we had a huge issue with

475
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
ppe early on

476
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
and people not having access to ppe

477
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,799
there was also an issue with sourcing

478
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
latex globally um and so there were all

479
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
of these various types of

480
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,360
motions that we were also trying to

481
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,840
account for um and really expand that

482
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,320
from that very narrow view um so anyway

483
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,799
so the assisted coveted task force

484
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
really grew out of that um that kind of

485
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,520
initial prioritization effort where we

486
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
were just kind of i mean to be blunt we

487
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
were just making stuff up

488
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,200
on the fly um and the um

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
the what we ended up coming to and you

490
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
know again not to go into tremendous

491
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,280
detail was we um we did an assessment of

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,200
all of the companies on the list um

493
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,679
according to four different criteria so

494
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
one was what is the product is it a

495
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,000
vaccine therapeutic or a diagnostic

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,840
but also more granularly is it an

497
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
mrna-based vaccine

498
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,360
is it an immunotherapy-based therapeutic

499
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
etc

500
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
is it a diagnostic that can be done in

501
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,960
the home or does it require um you know

502
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,559
lab-based testing um another of them the

503
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
criteria was how scarce is this um is

504
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
there only one company able to make this

505
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
um or are there other companies that can

506
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
also make this thing um do we have a

507
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
high supply of it or a low supply of it

508
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,799
so things like that um we also

509
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,640
considered um

510
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,360
the dependency rating of the companies

511
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,160
so a good example around dependency is

512
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
for all of the nucleic acid-based

513
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
vaccines they all require this same kind

514
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,720
of really specific phospholipid um to

515
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
encapsulate them so that they can be

516
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
absorbed and integrated into your

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,280
biology

518
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
and so those phospholipids there you

519
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,120
know we learned that there was actually

520
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
very few um sources for those

521
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
phospholipids and yet all of these

522
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
products were going to need them so that

523
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
was kind of where the dependency came in

524
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,200
um and then there was also a material

525
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
impact potential rating that was very

526
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,240
subjective

527
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
it was basically me and reuben going

528
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,679
through the list and thinking about you

529
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,919
know if we had this how impactful would

530
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,440
that be for our ability to respond to

531
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
the pandemic

532
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,440
so we went through this list um and did

533
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
all of these ratings and then kind of

534
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
racked and stacked and um you know

535
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
developed a metric that prioritized the

536
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
list and then we took that prioritized

537
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
list and we broke it up into three

538
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,120
chunks um you know the top tier where

539
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
the most important to protect to the

540
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
middle tier um well we'll get to them

541
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,280
when we have time and then the last year

542
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,480
we're not going to worry about them so

543
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
much and that in that way we were able

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
to really prioritize um cyber security

545
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
service delivery for those most critical

546
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
entities and we had a couple really

547
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,360
interesting things that um came out of

548
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,039
that initial prioritization that gave us

549
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,960
confidence that it was actually doing

550
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
something useful um and i think that was

551
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,840
really the nucleus of what justified to

552
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,520
leadership you know that we really

553
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
didn't need this coveted task

554
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
force that was going to not only

555
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
implement this initial prioritization

556
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,240
but as new things arose as you know

557
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,080
shortages in ppe as um you know hacks on

558
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
um you know healthcare delivery

559
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
organizations as all of that continued

560
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,559
to happen um that we were able to

561
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,440
continue to respond um in a in a timely

562
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
manner so you know a key thing to note

563
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
here is that you know we are from

564
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,320
diverse backgrounds i am not a hacker

565
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,159
although i've gotten a lot more into

566
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,000
cyber security and the security aspects

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
of biotech in particular

568
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
since doing this work and i think that

569
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
it really does take all of those various

570
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,400
perspectives um you know thinking about

571
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,919
things from a systems perspective

572
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
thinking about things from a biology

573
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,000
perspective in this case i think is

574
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,640
really critical

575
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,400
so yeah next slide um so one of the um

576
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
the other fun things was in addition to

577
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
people like myself who kind of detailed

578
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,520
in um and reuven who detailed in and

579
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,159
josh who detailed in we also were kind

580
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
of creating a coalition of the willing

581
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,840
in a way right and so

582
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
um people were excited to contribute to

583
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
this effort and um you know creating

584
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
that energy um and really figuring out

585
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,080
who was going to be um you know helpful

586
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
and willing to help and almost

587
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
i mean everybody was amazing everybody

588
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,919
that we worked with was amazing and one

589
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,440
of the things that we did kind of early

590
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,880
on was um we went around and and talked

591
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
about who was your superhero that you

592
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
identified with um and that was

593
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
something that i think was was really

594
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,760
important and mine is elastigirl i also

595
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,840
teach yoga is one of the things that i

596
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,600
do and i always say we bend so we don't

597
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
break and i think that's a critical

598
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,200
message around resilience is you know

599
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,240
figuring out how we can adapt um and

600
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
continue to pivot

601
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,480
whenever new things um were arising as

602
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
they were daily uh during this time

603
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
um so next um

604
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
yeah so you know kind of i i think i

605
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,919
already voice tracked this but really we

606
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,600
had you know some cares act hires there

607
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,679
was a hiring authority that was able to

608
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
bring people in really quickly um and

609
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
you know so ruben was able to come on

610
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
board really quickly um in other cases

611
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
like in lisa's case it wasn't so quick

612
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,240
um but you know in in some cases it was

613
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
really very quick people were able to

614
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
come on board and come on board in kind

615
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
of a flexible manner which is not usual

616
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
for the federal government you may be

617
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,799
surprised to know it usually takes a

618
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
really long time um and there's a limit

619
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
in terms of the number of billets um and

620
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
so one of the things that i'd like to

621
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,000
suggest as you know the cavalry

622
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
considers how it works um in the future

623
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,360
going forward you know cisa as the

624
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,679
youngest government agency really is in

625
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,720
a

626
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,280
an opportunity moment i think where it

627
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,720
is influenceable more so than it will be

628
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
in the next 10 years and um you know i

629
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
think josh having people come in um in

630
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
this kind of a flexible like

631
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
fellowship kind of a way from the

632
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,400
cavalry into sissa i think would be one

633
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
really exciting way to do that so the

634
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
the fellowship that i did um

635
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,480
that brought me to cisa is this

636
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
presidential innovation fellowship that

637
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,679
kind of does the same thing your term

638
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,159
limited your for one year you can extend

639
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,400
to a second year but the point is to

640
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,880
bring people from tech companies that

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,240
are going to bring in the latest and

642
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
greatest from tech directly into the

643
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,760
government in kind of a leadership role

644
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,840
and i think that would be a great model

645
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
to follow um with the cavalry going

646
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,679
forward as one of the ways that you can

647
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
continue to influence um the way that

648
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
things are going um especially in the

649
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
government thing um and then you know we

650
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,320
certainly had um you know career system

651
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,360
employees that joined um the task force

652
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,480
um so let's go to the next slide

653
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,080
so operation warp speed i gave a little

654
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,600
bit of an introduction um of that um and

655
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
so basically operation warp speed was a

656
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,760
whole of government effort to develop

657
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,279
the vaccines therapeutics and

658
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,840
diagnostics we needed for coven 19.

659
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
there was a lot of early focus on the

660
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,520
vaccine especially if you're

661
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
if you understand infectious diseases

662
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,320
and epidemic spread

663
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
you know the sooner you have a vaccine

664
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,080
the sooner you can really prevent things

665
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
and we're we're seeing a really

666
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
interesting path with covid where you

667
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
know yes the vaccine is helpful but we

668
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,919
also need the other things too and so

669
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,200
it's good that we were funding those

670
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
initially um you know but at the same

671
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,360
time you know we had a will we had an

672
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
awareness that it's not just about those

673
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,559
specific products you know there's a lot

674
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,600
of adjacencies here that go into

675
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
protecting the critical infrastructure

676
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,760
that is you know provide health care and

677
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
and what is what is the term for it

678
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,279
provide medical care provide medical

679
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,559
care um so anyway all of that to say you

680
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
know i think that their operation warp

681
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,000
speed was a way for us to um not only um

682
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
hone in on what we were focusing on but

683
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
also you know thinking about protecting

684
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
that broader mission because the rest of

685
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,320
operation warp speed wasn't focused on

686
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,559
that right so one of the challenges we

687
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,960
saw was that who is going to who's going

688
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
to be a little bit more forward thinking

689
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,799
who's going to think more broadly about

690
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
you know how we really do this in a way

691
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,679
that that's meaningful and saves lives

692
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,120
so that was another thing that we took

693
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
on um we were very integrated with all

694
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,679
of the operation warp speed stuff we

695
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,679
talked to dod all the time we talked to

696
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,880
hhs all the time um and we also got

697
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
really close with the the on the

698
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,400
government coordinating council with the

699
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,279
hisac um there wasn't to buy isaac at

700
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,640
the time they just launched i believe

701
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,760
last year um but and a lot of that grew

702
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,159
out of the need that we saw um and some

703
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,320
of the vulnerabilities we saw in biotech

704
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,640
um during this time um but the health

705
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,400
ice sac i think you know we learned a

706
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
lot from the health isac and i think

707
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
that's another way that these public

708
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
private partnerships are really critical

709
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
is even just in information sharing and

710
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,080
awareness of the state

711
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
um you know there was a very chilling i

712
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,200
don't remember the number but there was

713
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,440
a very chilling um

714
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
number or i think it was something like

715
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,279
80 percent of healthcare delivery

716
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,880
organizations or something were

717
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,039
operating with outdated software do you

718
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,919
remember what that that um i forget the

719
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,760
number but anyway um

720
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
it's chilling when you think about that

721
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,080
like do you really want you know the

722
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,240
i had a my youngest son was in the nicu

723
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,000
for three months and i think about like

724
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,640
the software that was running all of his

725
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,039
equipment and keeping him alive every

726
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
day like do you really want the those

727
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,400
hackable um or be really vulnerable to

728
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
security threats so anyway that's um

729
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,640
just uh personally um something that i

730
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
think a lot about

731
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,679
yeah next slide

732
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,320
okay so the the goal of the the kind of

733
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
ball bearing strategy was really to

734
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,279
again a prioritization effort so that we

735
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,600
could uh focus our secure our delivery

736
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,400
of services to the weakest links um so

737
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
finding the weakest links finding the

738
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,640
the key targets for attack and being

739
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,679
able to action on them

740
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
um

741
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
okay i think i voice track this mostly

742
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,600
but yeah so we you know we really um

743
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,399
again we focused on um this kind of

744
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,000
operation warp speed as kind of the way

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
that we centered where we were looking

746
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
but again we thought more broadly about

747
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
it too um and then the output of that

748
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
effort was to figure out you know who

749
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
was our tier one how are we going to get

750
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
this list of thousands down to a

751
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,640
manageable number um and then work with

752
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,799
our regional teams to actually be able

753
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,840
to

754
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
provide that support and um cyber

755
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,600
security service delivery to these

756
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,840
organizations and even just assess you

757
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
know what their cyber security status

758
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,320
was um you know early on one of the

759
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
entities that we identified we reached

760
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,120
out to them um and we've learned that

761
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,840
they didn't have any security

762
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
people on staff at all they had two

763
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
it people um and they were both like oh

764
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,559
okay um wow this is interesting the

765
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
government wants to talk to us about our

766
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,039
security but we don't actually do that

767
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,799
and one of the strategies that they used

768
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,200
was to keep their manufacturing offline

769
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
you know which is a fine strategy in

770
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
some cases um and certainly for parts of

771
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,679
their system but this this company um

772
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,840
was quickly then acquired by a larger

773
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,200
organization which made our outreach a

774
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
lot more complicated

775
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,559
because then we had to

776
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,399
talk with our international partners

777
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,600
about talking with them because it was

778
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
an international company whose cyber

779
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
security was in a different country than

780
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,240
the company's headquarters so now there

781
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
are three countries three countries

782
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
governments having to coordinate on you

783
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
know how do we talk to this organization

784
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,120
how do we give them the security um

785
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,679
services they need um so that we're

786
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,200
gonna protect this because this was one

787
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,440
of the ball bearings um so you know i

788
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,039
think that's a really good good example

789
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,640
of how you know all of the this

790
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,679
coordination not only like our team um

791
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,039
you know but also the coordination

792
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,640
across governments uh was really

793
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,279
critical to to this mission

794
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,039
um and then we also you know thought

795
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,559
more broadly about healthcare delivery

796
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,720
organizations and um lisa's going to

797
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,880
talk to you more about that

798
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
right okay

799
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,840
so so this is complicated all of this

800
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,600
stuff up here so hang on a second

801
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,640
because i want to make sure i don't

802
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,279
forget anything

803
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,480
how about that

804
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,840
better yay okay all right so so michelle

805
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,440
said a lot of things and the title of

806
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,520
this is cyber security lessons learned

807
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,760
so i'm gonna i'm gonna translate a few

808
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,679
things uh um

809
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,279
so remember that the ball bearing

810
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,520
strategy was fantastically um applied

811
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,159
because risk is always about uncertainty

812
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,159
and it's about focus on the critical few

813
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,799
right so in all of your organizations

814
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,399
you should be focused on the critical

815
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,320
few things that matter to your mission

816
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
now your mission could be government

817
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,799
industry for-profit non-profit it makes

818
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,640
no difference the point is all the

819
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
assets that you're trying to protect

820
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,399
need to be

821
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,120
in service of the mission right and so

822
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,559
the other thing that she talked about a

823
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,520
lot you know translates into supply

824
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,919
chain right so i'm a risk person not i

825
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,039
mean yes i have a cyber background yes i

826
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,039
i'm going to make a shameless plug here

827
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,840
for for anybody who's interested in

828
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
getting groomed to serve on the isc 2

829
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
board of directors so i am

830
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,640
an ic squared uh member long term and i

831
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,159
know that some of you are disgruntled

832
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,080
but the point is we're doing fantastic

833
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,960
things

834
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
we're doing fantastic things there and

835
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
and we need more diversity and inclusion

836
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
on the board so just fyi okay so a long

837
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,760
story is that you know supply chain i

838
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,880
mean when josh called me um and said you

839
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,480
know we're putting a band together to do

840
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
some some protection of the supply chain

841
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,960
of the vaccine i was like okay i'm in

842
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,159
he didn't tell me what we were going to

843
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,720
be doing and actually in the end so my

844
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,320
avatar

845
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
i'm a big avatar uh uh

846
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,880
avatar the airbender so i'm katara but

847
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
the point is is that is that my i didn't

848
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
have an avatar when i first started and

849
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
i was the last one to join the team and

850
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
so somebody i don't know if ed's here

851
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
but he gave me the one called semper

852
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,559
gumby and the reason he gave me semper

853
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,159
gumby is because i'm always about okay

854
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,279
how are we going to meet people where

855
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,039
they are and how are we going to like

856
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,360
bring them along right and and we had to

857
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
meet people as michelle indicated and

858
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,159
canada indicated at various levels of

859
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,159
understanding various levels of we're

860
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,919
from the government we're here to help

861
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,000
you know and just imagine getting a call

862
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
like that right

863
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,120
and and plus we had a mission right the

864
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,559
operation warp suite was run by the

865
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,399
military but the the vaccine and the

866
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,760
other you know

867
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,399
other things were run by by people like

868
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,120
us

869
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
um so i'm gonna talk josh gave you a lot

870
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
of statistical information but i'm gonna

871
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,279
try to make this next section about what

872
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,360
we learned so my background is in risk

873
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
but it's also in um so i spent three

874
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
years working in in automotive safety

875
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,080
and have helping um

876
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
improve the security

877
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,559
from a coding perspective right and then

878
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
i also worked in the energy i was

879
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
working in energy municipal power

880
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,960
specifically but also national rural

881
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,039
electric cooperative association when i

882
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,880
say two guys in a generator i mean

883
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,080
sometimes there's only one guy in a

884
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,240
generator in the middle of oklahoma and

885
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,559
so i was working in in for the energy

886
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,120
sector and and of course water was a

887
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
part of that uh you know how do we

888
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,919
protect those things and i had a public

889
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,600
private partnership background like how

890
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
do we actually

891
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,120
get people to fund

892
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
you know people who can actually do

893
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
things in the field so i'm i'm really

894
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
excited i have another talk this

895
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,880
afternoon david are you here yes

896
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,720
about about the dumpster fire that is

897
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
critical infrastructure and how we're

898
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,039
trying to help but okay so uh next slide

899
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,039
sorry okay so josh spoke about this but

900
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,760
i want to be very specific so think back

901
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
to the spring of 2021 i know we all have

902
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,919
a little bit of you know

903
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,240
trauma around this time but the vaccines

904
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
had recently begun

905
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,240
sorry i can't see the vaccines had

906
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,080
recently begun to roll out right and the

907
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,640
pandemic was continuing to exacerbate

908
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
existing strains on the national

909
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
critical function of provide medical

910
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,960
care hospitals were flooded with

911
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,039
patients that needed acute care

912
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,919
materials and ppe were in short supply

913
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,600
and there were low vaccination rates and

914
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,640
remember dhs's mission also had a misdis

915
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,880
and mal information campaign that they

916
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
were running that from the previous year

917
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
on the election and there was a ton of

918
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
you know social media

919
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
targeted misdis and mal information

920
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,320
about vaccines which created vaccine

921
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,640
hesitancy so we were combating those

922
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,120
threats at the same time and so the team

923
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
undertook some amazing research which is

924
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
on this slide and there's even more the

925
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,960
papers that josh showed earlier with the

926
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,640
purpose to understand not just the

927
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,360
functional impact at the ground truth

928
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,880
level about what was going on in

929
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
hospitals and hospital operations but

930
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,240
the cascading impacts on other critical

931
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
infrastructure sectors so as i said i

932
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,679
was in the energy sector and and the

933
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
american public power association was my

934
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,519
customer long-term customer if you're

935
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,119
familiar with the cyber security score

936
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,560
card um that appa rolled out uh i was a

937
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
big part of that effort

938
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,079
there was a big team not just me but the

939
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,560
point is we were trying to raise the bar

940
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,960
on cyber security in the smaller

941
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,839
municipals and rural co-ops and so that

942
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,760
what were the cascading impacts from

943
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,480
this um you know electric food water

944
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,320
logistics to losing critical

945
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,560
infrastructure workers right because at

946
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,960
that time we also were very much in need

947
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
of personnel and when appa before

948
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
vaccines right in the very beginning

949
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,040
we were having daily and weekly calls

950
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,918
about

951
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,679
sequestering we sequestered all of our

952
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
line operators and all of the

953
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,119
maintenance people and some of you in

954
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,480
this room may have been sequestered in

955
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,159
some of the hotels that weren't being

956
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,359
used anymore because people weren't

957
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,520
traveling so we were putting people in

958
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
you know very strategic uh locations so

959
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,960
that if something happened to

960
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
various parts of critical infrastructure

961
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
we would have people who were healthy

962
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
who would be able to to service that so

963
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,599
that was pretty um that was pretty

964
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,960
important so so unlike covet deaths

965
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,000
overall which generally struck those age

966
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,160
75 years or older the excess deaths were

967
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,440
highest in the 25 to 44 year old ranks

968
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
you know and when you think about the

969
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,720
those are the people who are serving up

970
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
our critical infrastructure by and large

971
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,440
and you know factors included avoiding

972
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,280
medical care because for other

973
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,200
conditions right like such as high blood

974
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
pressure diabetes or other

975
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,280
you know things that were going on

976
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,359
postponing elective surgeries for too

977
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,400
long

978
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
and also loss of health care because

979
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
they lost their job or they lost their

980
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,280
benefits or you know loss of income but

981
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
the racial and ethnic subgroups

982
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
experienced a disproportionately higher

983
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
percentage increases in death during

984
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,560
this time right with the most pronounced

985
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
effects on hispanic and black

986
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,480
communities and so that's also in our

987
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,320
research so you'll see that in there and

988
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
that we think was you know a terrible

989
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,040
thing in it and uh but this trend

990
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,320
continued until um well in september

991
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,920
2021 there's a state of emergency that

992
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,280
you can declare as a health care

993
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,839
provider called uh critical i want to

994
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
make sure i got it right crisis

995
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
standards of care right it's known as

996
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,400
csc and by september of 2021 there were

997
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,040
four or five u.s based and we

998
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
we were in coordination with our

999
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,400
international partners but i can only

1000
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,920
speak about the us

1001
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,800
uh uh the point is by december of 2021

1002
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
there were nine out of 50 states

1003
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,040
operating it at crisis standards of care

1004
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,680
so this was quite um

1005
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,040
you know it was quite

1006
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,200
the trend was also happening across the

1007
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
globe so i'll go to the next one and the

1008
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
perfect storm what created the perfect

1009
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,240
storm is also the bad actors you know

1010
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,160
were opportunistic in looking to do bad

1011
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,839
things and with the health care

1012
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,000
organizations already suffering it

1013
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,320
became harder to prioritize the cyber

1014
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
security practices that needed attention

1015
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
hence the work we did on bad practices

1016
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
hence the work we did to make sure that

1017
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,320
we were vocal about absolutely everybody

1018
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,920
knows that

1019
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,240
certain things are just terrible right

1020
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,200
um and so don't do them but but it was

1021
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
hard to get the word out because of the

1022
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,599
noise right and and i think i don't know

1023
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,760
josh and i did and many of us did many

1024
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
tabletop exercises with organizations

1025
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,320
and what we found out we learned through

1026
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,880
the health isac uh you know is that the

1027
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,079
majority of their members were not a

1028
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,560
cyber poor they were actually in the

1029
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,640
upper echelons and they had the time and

1030
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,960
energy to devote to to belonging to ice

1031
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
axe so how did we get the information

1032
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
out to those who needed it most right um

1033
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,520
and so many of the hospitals um you know

1034
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
the other thing we learned is that they

1035
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
did not many of them have an incident

1036
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,240
response plan of any kind of generally

1037
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,480
speaking so they hadn't really thought i

1038
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,839
mean the fact that they weren't all

1039
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,280
patched and all the other things that

1040
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,359
you know michelle talked about you know

1041
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,680
they didn't also have the basic

1042
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,680
resources and one of the things that you

1043
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
know as public private partners one of

1044
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
the solutions is i'm most proud of is

1045
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,359
when we did the work on the cyber

1046
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,440
security scorecard the first year you

1047
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,680
know we went around and basically

1048
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,520
put together an incident response plan

1049
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,000
for municipal power companies and gave

1050
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
it to them now it was funded by doe

1051
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
which then got funded appa but the point

1052
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
is is that money has to trickle down to

1053
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,800
get to people who need the things and

1054
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,079
tools right

1055
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,200
um

1056
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
okay so

1057
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,480
the other thing about incident response

1058
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,000
plans is even the ones that had

1059
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,680
something on paper

1060
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,400
they they hadn't tested it under some of

1061
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
the conditions under which they were

1062
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,560
operating so go to the next one now josh

1063
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,359
mentioned uh the ransomware event and

1064
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,240
you know

1065
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,400
it was terrible but it gave us the

1066
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
ability to actually look at what happens

1067
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
to someone when they have a ransomware

1068
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
event and talk about it right and so in

1069
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
this thing you'll see a timeline and we

1070
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,440
published a

1071
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,680
good bit of research but you know what

1072
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
actually happens when someone is is

1073
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
suffering from a ransomware attack go

1074
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,720
ahead and go to the next one because

1075
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,480
these are some of the knock-on effects

1076
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,680
that happen right you know and even just

1077
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,720
what josh mentioned earlier not having

1078
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,760
electronic health records available and

1079
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
having to revert to pen and paper well

1080
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
then how do you get pen and paper

1081
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,480
records on someone to some to the next

1082
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
medical professional down the line who

1083
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
actually needs that information right

1084
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
and so uh go to the next slide because

1085
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
um one of the other boards i serve on is

1086
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,520
sierra and and uh for the society of

1087
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
information risk analyst which is a

1088
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,920
quantitative risk uh group of of

1089
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
non-hackers uh but the point here is

1090
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,119
that josh uh jeff who couldn't be with

1091
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,640
us today who's part of the team and dr

1092
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,839
katie uh uh webster

1093
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,200
were you know instrumental in in asking

1094
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,040
the questions asking the tough questions

1095
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
and then performing the research so this

1096
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
talk is actually recorded

1097
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
um

1098
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
uh it was done in 20 what is this

1099
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,359
september of 2021 i think um

1100
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,200
but that was when we first i think at

1101
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
that point some of the research that

1102
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
josh spoke about hadn't been published

1103
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
right it hadn't been published until

1104
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,760
later we were having trouble getting the

1105
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,160
word out right doing great work but

1106
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
having trouble getting the word out so

1107
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,319
i'm gonna turn it back to kendra and

1108
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,160
we'll we'll finish up here go ahead

1109
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
okay just real quick we're gonna go

1110
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
through um i guess first of all i should

1111
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,280
say my superhero was wonder woman and i

1112
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,680
feel like i spent most of my time just

1113
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,000
spinning around trying to get that magic

1114
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,880
going

1115
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,960
and so you know as josh said my

1116
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
contribution to the team was

1117
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,480
the glue

1118
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,079
the glue there you go

1119
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,400
um so what i want to talk about now

1120
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
and i'm going to talk about it at a very

1121
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,560
high level because later this afternoon

1122
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,640
tom and don who are over here with us

1123
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,480
from cisa are going to actually go into

1124
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,079
the details of some of the work we've

1125
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,079
developed in the cyber area but

1126
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,960
basically what happened is as we i'll

1127
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,760
get it oh no i can i'll just sit closer

1128
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
you know

1129
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,079
so there we go um as the task force kind

1130
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,720
of moved from operation warp speed away

1131
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,520
from the vaccines our focus really was

1132
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,920
on the healthcare delivery organizations

1133
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,400
small to medium-sized businesses kind of

1134
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
key to the whole infrastructure of

1135
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
healthcare in the country and so we took

1136
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,359
a lot of the work that we had been doing

1137
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,119
we were already had

1138
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,000
and we're promoting free cyber services

1139
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,119
and we specifically went after the hdos

1140
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,640
and went out to the healthcare delivery

1141
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,040
organizations and said do you know we do

1142
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,240
this

1143
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,960
we had had a lot of

1144
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,599
practice or prep with those documents

1145
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,520
the year before during the election we

1146
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,680
had updated a lot of our documents to go

1147
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,560
to local election boards and help them

1148
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
with how do you make sure your systems

1149
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,040
at your local level are secure

1150
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,960
and so here's just a list of some of the

1151
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,760
programs we have

1152
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,440
and again we

1153
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,000
had some that we started with

1154
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,200
but then

1155
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,079
for example stuff off search getting

1156
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,960
 off showdown stuff off search also

1157
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,280
looking at census thingful any of the

1158
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
things that that are visible you know

1159
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,920
where your devices have visibility on

1160
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,920
web-based search platforms with

1161
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,079
something that we felt was important to

1162
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,520
everybody but we had a mechanism to say

1163
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,079
let's develop some products to help the

1164
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,800
hdos to help those small businesses

1165
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,599
those small entities understand

1166
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,400
what this specific risk is and this is

1167
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,920
was just kind of the first of the

1168
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,960
examples of products we developed within

1169
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,880
the task force and then said oh wait we

1170
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
have this cyber security division at

1171
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,359
cisa that's here all the time doing this

1172
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,440
you know over and over and over again

1173
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,359
and so we're able to pass those off so

1174
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,240
they're now you know living documents at

1175
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,040
cisa and not just focus on the health

1176
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,240
care delivery section

1177
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,119
we also talk again about

1178
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,839
that that whole

1179
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,400
broadly

1180
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,440
broad

1181
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,920
definition of our intended audience is

1182
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,400
the target rich cyber

1183
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
cyber poor

1184
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,520
and so again

1185
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,440
support for the health care delivery

1186
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,880
organizations

1187
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
and trying to take both what we already

1188
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,520
had and then the new things we were

1189
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,040
developing

1190
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,400
i think several people have mentioned

1191
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,119
the bad practices um i think that's when

1192
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,280
we tom was already a part of our

1193
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,240
sisakova task force as a career employee

1194
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,079
we then had to pull in don bernat

1195
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,000
because he really liked what we were

1196
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,680
doing we liked what he was doing as the

1197
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,280
head of our vulnerability management

1198
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
group at the time

1199
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,560
and so these are the sorts of things

1200
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,000
where again

1201
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,560
really basic help

1202
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,680
to small entities like the organization

1203
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,520
that michelle mentioned earlier who

1204
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
didn't even have cyber staff and yet

1205
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,560
they were producing part of the critical

1206
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,240
vaccines that we needed to get out in

1207
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
the country and so trying to help people

1208
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,839
with understanding you know what our

1209
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,560
strong password practices how do you you

1210
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,640
know make sure you're installing patches

1211
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,160
that you're keeping your software up to

1212
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,440
date getting your stuff off search

1213
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,040
it really became a way for us to

1214
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,520
quickly

1215
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,760
develop and pass on

1216
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,319
information that was specific to the

1217
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,880
covid community but would have broader

1218
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,040
implications for critical infrastructure

1219
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,720
which is you know

1220
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,480
cis job

1221
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,040
so basically our premise was that what

1222
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,319
we were implementing um for

1223
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,240
the community we were focused on during

1224
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,200
the koba task force the focus on vaccine

1225
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,839
and overall patient care priorities also

1226
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,760
allowed us to start building for the

1227
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,760
future of what the agency could be doing

1228
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,599
um

1229
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,680
so when we look at kind of lessons

1230
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,760
learned i would say the first one we

1231
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,520
kind of looked at this

1232
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,560
smaller more nimble organization within

1233
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,680
sisa that was allowed to give us that

1234
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,920
ability to to pull to do more

1235
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,280
cross-agency coordination

1236
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,440
um frankly i think i know more people

1237
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,079
across this uh than my colleagues now

1238
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,599
that i worked there full time that my

1239
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,760
colleagues within my group know

1240
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,520
across the agency i was able to work

1241
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,119
with different different branches

1242
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,200
different divisions and we were able to

1243
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,240
take that work much broader um

1244
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,520
always opportunities for improvement um

1245
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,119
but here are kind of our list of

1246
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,280
the basic um

1247
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,160
good

1248
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,400
good the bad and the ugly you know the

1249
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
having that karzak staff having people

1250
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,160
come in from the outside with different

1251
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,800
perspectives different mentalities

1252
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,319
um crisis is a perfect time for piloting

1253
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,839
efforts like

1254
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,640
we didn't get a we did get pushback

1255
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,400
but we didn't always get pushed back and

1256
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,880
we were able to achieve a lot in a very

1257
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,640
short period of time

1258
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,599
um it gave us a lot of ability to reach

1259
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,079
out across the healthcare community

1260
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,480
international sharing beau especially

1261
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,560
did a lot of work overseas with our

1262
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,000
counterparts

1263
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,160
um

1264
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,839
i think with only five minutes left

1265
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,040
we're probably not going to talk about

1266
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,760
well

1267
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,680
there's always work left to be done and

1268
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,359
we have work left to be done within the

1269
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,280
agency and outside

1270
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
um

1271
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,560
again how cisa can help these are the

1272
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,920
kind of things i think we'll talk about

1273
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,319
some more this afternoon

1274
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,839
um

1275
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,599
but yeah do you guys want to kind of add

1276
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,440
to any of these closing ones yes can i

1277
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
say one more thing so we actually uh i'm

1278
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,920
really proud of this because we won

1279
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
what's called a unity of effort award

1280
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,680
okay it's a really nice statue that they

1281
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,000
sent us but it wasn't that the reason

1282
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,599
that i'm really proud of it is because

1283
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,359
of what both my colleagues said and

1284
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,520
everyone here has said is that we made

1285
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
people talk to each other who didn't

1286
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,119
want to talk to each other so we we were

1287
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,720
all the people in different silos

1288
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,920
you know and and that for me was like a

1289
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,000
proud moment so even if i hold up that

1290
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,680
award and you know it sits behind me on

1291
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,480
my bookshelf you know like when when uh

1292
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,880
you know we we

1293
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,319
picked up the phone and called the

1294
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,160
people we knew and called the people

1295
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,760
they knew and called people somebody

1296
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,160
else knew and so when you know when we

1297
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,760
talk about a hacker community i mean

1298
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,359
that's one of the ways we hacked the

1299
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,200
government you know is just to call

1300
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,440
people and and talk did joshua say

1301
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,400
something

1302
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,240
just since there's a break after this we

1303
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,520
could take a couple of questions even

1304
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,880
though we're one

1305
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,440
just to tag on to that one of the ways

1306
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,680
in which we did that was that was

1307
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,200
shocking to me and actually took a

1308
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,880
really long time was the way that we

1309
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,440
talked to the fbi so regularly um

1310
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,520
because you know with the field offices

1311
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,839
there was a lack of coordination at the

1312
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,119
local level between intel and you know

1313
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,040
cisa and i think there was it was

1314
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,720
partially just because there was trust

1315
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,240
building that needed to happen there

1316
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,000
says it was new to this game we were

1317
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,319
brand new um and we were leveraging our

1318
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,480
dhs field offices

1319
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,200
and so doing that coordination with fbi

1320
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,839
it also took a really it took a lot um

1321
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,000
and i think that was one of the biggest

1322
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,319
pieces of progress that was made agreed

1323
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,319
yeah and and we did a tabletop with the

1324
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,960
fema uh folks which was super awesome

1325
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,440
because there was like 90 fema and a lot

1326
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,599
of them are lawyers and they were like

1327
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,160
really scheming on how they could like

1328
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,720
put in some emergency uh authorizations

1329
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,280
to help people right and it was a great

1330
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,680
like it was a bright spot for me because

1331
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,520
they were just so willing to say yeah

1332
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,040
throw down let's spend some money on

1333
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,720
helping people over here and you know

1334
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,319
and we can do this and we can do that

1335
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,000
and so i was jazzed by a lot of that

1336
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,240
despite the ptsd of you know working

1337
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,040
across government

1338
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,559
uh oh we got a stop sign

1339
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,540
yeah we do that okay great

1340
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,559
[Music]

1341
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:01,760
try to use the mic so people on the

1342
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,559
streaming can hear you

1343
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,800
well can you all hear me okay

1344
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,200
um first thank you for what you all did

1345
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,520
to help through a difficult critical

1346
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,400
time really appreciate y'all for that um

1347
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,640
you have this opportunity to stand up a

1348
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,880
team for a purpose

1349
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,119
and i'm just curious to see is the ctf

1350
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,920
still in place did it dissolve and how

1351
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,839
does that work continue if you pull

1352
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,920
together for something like that how do

1353
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,359
you make sure that the initiatives that

1354
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,680
you started continue after that that

1355
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,079
initiative is no longer there

1356
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,440
uh great question so the task force was

1357
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,839
formally disbanded the beginning of this

1358
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
year

1359
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,720
we had

1360
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,160
during the whole course of it we always

1361
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,000
had a strategy that some of us were

1362
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,760
discussing which is we're going to

1363
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,000
spread out across the agency when we

1364
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,240
leave the task force if we embed

1365
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,480
ourselves in different divisions and

1366
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,119
different groups we will keep the

1367
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,960
dialogue going

1368
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,079
um so a couple of us stayed a few of us

1369
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,400
i think there are at least three cares

1370
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
act who converted there were some

1371
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,160
existing people both still with us

1372
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,680
so

1373
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,599
those of us left have tried to

1374
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,599
intentionally you know we know something

1375
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,200
the rest of the agency doesn't know

1376
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,040
there's a ton i don't know about how the

1377
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,520
agency works but what i do know is how i

1378
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,119
can reach across

1379
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,359
to different groups and i think

1380
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,000
um we've tried to leave that we've also

1381
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,920
again how many of us from the task force

1382
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,079
are here in the room today

1383
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,079
hit oops like

1384
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,960
half half of the task force is here and

1385
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,680
so i think we developed a

1386
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,319
a passion for this

1387
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,559
this mission that turned out to be i am

1388
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,000
the cavalry

1389
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,480
like or next nexus 2

1390
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
that's going to keep us kind of together

1391
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,920
in in trying to

1392
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,440
both work

1393
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,680
extending the work of of the covid task

1394
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,920
force but also the work of government

1395
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,400
how do we make government more official

1396
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,680
more efficient more relatable at a local

1397
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,680
level so and kendrick

1398
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,480
um

1399
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,800
you shared last night that um because

1400
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,640
i've since moved on but you shared last

1401
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,040
night that there's now someone who's

1402
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,800
come to cisa to lead up like medical um

1403
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,599
which is not a domain that cisa had had

1404
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,280
coverage on from a subject matter

1405
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,119
expertise perspective which was kind of

1406
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,280
why i was brought in initially but you

1407
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,960
know so building that expert a

1408
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,440
realization that that is an important

1409
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,599
expertise to have when you're trying to

1410
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,720
protect the nation's critical

1411
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,839
infrastructure is good

1412
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,839
while they're heading up yep one of the

1413
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,000
reasons i said we're still needed is

1414
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,400
there's a strong desire based on chris

1415
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,319
hoff's keynote of conway's law there's a

1416
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,079
strong desire for like agencies to stay

1417
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,520
out of each other's way

1418
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
but what we realized early is these

1419
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,200
multi-disciplinary intersectional risks

1420
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,480
require multi-disciplinary

1421
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,319
intersectional solutions

1422
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,520
so there's a

1423
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,359
almost like a battle for the soul of

1424
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,079
government of are we going to be siloed

1425
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,839
by agency or are we going to

1426
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,920
be cross-cutting and they're keeping the

1427
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,520
flame alive for the forced uncomfortable

1428
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,040
interagency collaboration even though

1429
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,640
it's the easier thing to do to stay in

1430
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,839
your silos but silos kill so

1431
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,720
go ahead

1432
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,200
can you guys all hear me yes thanks hey

1433
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,119
um so first of all thank you i actually

1434
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,480
work for an organization that supports

1435
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,319
the defense health agency so you guys

1436
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,760
were integral to

1437
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,359
yay team awesome

1438
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,720
so thank you very much for that so my

1439
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,079
question is is

1440
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,160
in my opinion um a lot of our c-suite

1441
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,520
guys were like who's gonna hack a

1442
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,680
hospital like what what bad guy out

1443
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,520
there

1444
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,520
meanwhile everybody who's in it is

1445
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
screaming like literally everybody but i

1446
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,960
feel like the problem that i'm having

1447
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,400
now is a lot of people are losing the

1448
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,000
cyber security message in the pandemic

1449
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,359
they're like oh they only went after us

1450
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,720
because things were so stressful

1451
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,800
hospitals are still safe are you seeing

1452
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,960
that shift are people starting to get it

1453
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,520
or really that makes okay i'll take it i

1454
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,599
will take the tiny little bits yeah oh

1455
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,000
wait michelle said something is better

1456
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,280
than nothing right okay so so the answer

1457
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,319
is yes we are i think there's a lot of

1458
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,800
passion around getting that message out

1459
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,480
uh

1460
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,640
so yes i hope i think so i hope so

1461
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,440
that was awesome by the way thank you so

1462
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,200
much for everything you've done i spent

1463
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,359
a lot of time in the small medium

1464
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,920
biotech space in community hospitals and

1465
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,359
places like that and i would love to

1466
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,200
hear just a little bit more of your

1467
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,040
stories about how when you called those

1468
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,760
guys up who have an i.t staff of two and

1469
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,079
no security people how did you actually

1470
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,160
get them to do anything and what was

1471
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,760
what was tell us more about those

1472
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,040
stories

1473
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,559
yeah that would have to be that was

1474
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:51,680
great

1475
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,920
because yeah i think so i think we're

1476
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,760
gonna have to cover that one and there

1477
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,680
were so many really good ones and i

1478
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,359
think bo would actually probably have

1479
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,359
some things to share about that and josh

1480
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,960
too but yeah because sometimes they

1481
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,720
thought they were getting punked like

1482
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,640
you're really from the government yeah

1483
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,160
and you're calling to offer me free

1484
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,319
cyber security services

1485
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,160
well and also often times in those

1486
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,960
initial calls we had to include all of

1487
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,280
our government interagency people so we

1488
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,280
would have someone from fbi on the call

1489
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,119
we had someone from hhs on the call we

1490
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,440
had sissa and people literally thought

1491
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,920
it was a joke initially it took a while

1492
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,200
for people to kind of trust us

1493
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,720
hi uh question for lisa

1494
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,920
um

1495
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,720
did you have any application for

1496
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,359
quantitative risk methods

1497
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,000
thank you russell if so

1498
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,440
what did you learn

1499
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,280
what were the benefits what would you

1500
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,240
advise other people so the answer is yes

1501
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
and to your question about do this does

1502
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
the suite actually pay attention to

1503
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,160
things russell is my partner in crime

1504
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,760
for for sierra

1505
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,799
and uh you know we're striving hard to

1506
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,520
stop talking about uh records and

1507
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,359
actually talk about impact to the

1508
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,839
business in what matters to them right

1509
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,520
and records may matter if you have a

1510
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,680
data breach but the point is those costs

1511
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,880
are well known and those are easily

1512
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,960
measurable the difficulty is in the

1513
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,200
things that we don't yet have full

1514
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,280
information for and russell has done

1515
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,079
some fantastic work in impact

1516
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,280
categorization cost and the reason i

1517
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,520
said it's important for you to focus on

1518
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,839
your mission is because the mission

1519
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,799
drives what you care about right and so

1520
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,559
whatever your mission is it makes no

1521
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,319
difference and one thing i didn't say

1522
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,319
when i started this is these are all my

1523
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,640
opinions i am not here representing any

1524
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,200
employer or dhs anymore or anybody that

1525
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,720
i've worked for ever

1526
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,920
um

1527
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,720
so the point is is that quantification

1528
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,200
gives you the ability to talk to

1529
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,640
business leaders in their terms i'll

1530
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,240
just give you a very simple example when

1531
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,720
you say server x is down because blah

1532
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,240
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

1533
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,319
nobody really cares but if you say

1534
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,240
server x is down and it impacts our

1535
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,559
ability to accept customer payments

1536
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,799
all of a sudden people pay attention you

1537
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,400
know all of a sudden when you can put it

1538
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,040
in terms that matter to the business

1539
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,839
you know people really do listen right

1540
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,559
so to the degree that we can do that um

1541
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,760
you know the better we can do it the

1542
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,319
better it informs our ability to talk to

1543
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,119
leaderships and people making decisions

1544
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,040
on the things that we're we're tasked

1545
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,839
with protecting

1546
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,839
all right i think we are out of time

1547
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:38,820
[Applause]
