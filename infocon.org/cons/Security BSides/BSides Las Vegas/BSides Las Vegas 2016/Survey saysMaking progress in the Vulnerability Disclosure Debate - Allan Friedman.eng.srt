00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,910
in that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to do much</font>

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,080
talking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm just going to tell</font>

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,269
you a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about what Commerce has</font>

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,670
been doing and the answer is we've been

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">having really smart people who are</font>

dedicated about the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,990
do a lot of hard work to make progress

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,890
on a fairly old problem infosec

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,909
vulnerability disclosure so my corner of

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the partner Commerce the National</font>

process focusing on vulnerability

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,870
disclosure it's been about running for

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,370
about nine months and we've had

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,079
brilliant folks from the security

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,239
research community from the vendor

help<font color="#E5E5E5"> promote that you've done a lot of</font>

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,260
from the three working groups that have

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,850
been very active over the past nine

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,309
months one on awareness<font color="#CCCCCC"> and adoption</font>

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,629
another on safety and disclosure and

28
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,280
finally on multi-party disclosure so

29
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,018
this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're about to see is</font>

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,720
not from the Department of Commerce it

31
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,390
is from the stakeholders who believe

this talk we're gonna have a fairly

34
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,220
brief talk and the goal really is to

35
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,770
have some discussion to your feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,350
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> share your perspectives on</font>

37
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,570
what we're missing and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,929
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring about some positive</font>

change so very<font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly Department of</font>

online<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trust is a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> priority for our</font>

be innovation there's not going to be

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:45,210
adoption markets will fail and sometimes

46
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,089
to fix the market failure you need

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,520
active regulation you need to weigh in

48
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,049
with the big stick of government we

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,750
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're actually often</font>

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,040
lighter touches so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,860
together those who care about this issue

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,500
and say how can we have collaboration

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,810
around vulnerability disclosure now this

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,240
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new debate we don't want to</font>

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,970
reinvent the wheel we want to find some

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">way of saying there are standards out</font>

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,330
there people have been thinking about

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">this issue for a long time</font>

59
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,890
how can we actually make some progress

60
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,959
so rather than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write new</font>

61
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,160
standards or even produce best practices

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,800
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with some</font>

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,900
principles of what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to of what</font>

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,530
we can do so that researchers who want

65
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,960
to continue to engage know how to engage

66
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,520
organizations who are new to this issue

67
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,380
understand what's at stake and what the

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,760
path forward is and the underlying

69
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,840
approach is there is no

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-size-fits-all that every</font>

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,680
organization is going to have something

72
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unique to them and different</font>

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,910
researchers each bug is at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

74
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,680
the day going to be unique and need to

75
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">be handled differently so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

76
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,860
broad issues that we can do so the

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">process has basically involved a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,800
talking it has involved some very

79
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,089
tedious meetings and even more tedious

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,090
phone calls so the people have been

81
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">engaged we really have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank them for</font>

82
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,750
all the hard work you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see</font>

83
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,670
the working group chairs but behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,739
as they will say a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very smart</font>

85
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,030
people were dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this so first</font>

86
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,470
we will talk about the awareness<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

87
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,200
adoption group and what's noteworthy

88
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,400
about this work is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think everyone</font>

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">this process is that at the end of the</font>

90
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,050
day raising<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness and driving</font>

91
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,510
adoption of existing good practices

92
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,430
really is the most important thing and

93
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,530
relates to all the other work that's

94
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,180
going on in vulnerability disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen</font>

sorry Jen Ellis from rapid seven and

96
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:48,989
Amanda Craig from Microsoft so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

learning that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the album does all the</font>

98
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,709
slides from now on

99
00:03:52,420 --> 00:04:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so as I'm jealous I run community</font>

100
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,830
and public affairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived at seven so I</font>

101
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,019
had a public engagement and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

102
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,599
about how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> support the security</font>

103
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,330
community you guys a little more which

104
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where this falls in Amanda Craig from</font>

105
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:19,728
Microsoft and I work on cyber security

106
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:29,030
policy issues hey rattleballs in this is

107
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:32,150
josh go huh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why why this why did</font>

108
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,530
we do all of this and and is it just

109
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we wanted to sit around and come</font>

110
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,909
by our I think you know ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

111
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alan said there's been a lot of work</font>

112
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,840
that's gone into talking about

113
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,870
vulnerability dispersion handling in the

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,520
past 20 years lots of incredibly smart

115
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,850
people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on this problem and</font>

116
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,130
there are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-established best</font>

117
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,020
practices for both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of equation for</font>

118
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:58,700
for researchers and for for vendors in

119
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,889
fact there are I so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

120
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">them however there's not very much</font>

121
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:09,020
adoption and so the the reality is that

122
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,729
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> continues and that if we</font>

123
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,310
can't solve adoption everything else

124
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,990
that we do is just academic it's just a

125
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of sitting around talking to people</font>

126
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,570
to death as I once said so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that</font>

127
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">was why we really wanted to focus on the</font>

128
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,270
Adoption Awareness problem is to make

129
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,000
the theoretical applied and actually try

130
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some change occur that was that</font>

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a big kind of focus for us so what</font>

132
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,139
we're going to talk to you about today's

133
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:40,099
surveys ooh sabes so sexy<font color="#CCCCCC"> they be even</font>

134
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,840
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you in the room if you'd know</font>

135
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:47,840
this is all

136
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,190
um so we uh it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funny we we</font>

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,419
were talking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font>

138
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,870
were lots of people in the rooms oh you

139
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,770
see people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I black</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um so</font>

140
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,880
at the beginning we were talking they

141
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,409
were lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different voices in the</font>

142
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,090
room from all different sort of sides of

143
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:05,060
the conversation and there were lots of

144
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,099
people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of dialogue you</font>

145
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:12,050
often hear in this discussion lots of

146
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:16,850
assumptions being made and we had this

147
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,310
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like very side conversation and</font>

148
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day about how you know if we're</font>

149
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,060
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get meaningful about coming up</font>

150
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,830
with ideas for adoption which is what we

151
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,820
were focused on then it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font>

152
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,130
good if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the bottom of</font>

153
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,700
what was really going on with the

154
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:34,940
surveys and like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the</font>

155
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,340
truth behind it and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

156
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">surveys initially was something that we</font>

157
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,820
were going to just basically put

158
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">together in a week and get out and it</font>

159
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,360
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be like a really quick thing</font>

160
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:49,400
that's not really what and so they

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,080
became this like huge thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ended</font>

162
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,630
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being one survey it was multiple</font>

163
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,539
surveys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the who we</font>

164
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,950
surveyed and why yeah so you know the

165
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">jen has mentioned some one of the</font>

166
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,550
reasons why we initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> came upon this</font>

167
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,310
idea of a survey was to challenge our

168
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,810
assumptions and sort of you know

169
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,820
challenge everyone that's been part of

170
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,849
this conversation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decade or more</font>

171
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,159
to rethink you know have the norms

172
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:15,590
changed but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you know new</font>

173
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,970
players in this space there the two

174
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,119
folks that are newly technology

175
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,010
providers automakers aviation companies

176
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,320
medical device manufacturers and so on

177
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,810
that are newly dealing with this issue

178
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,969
of vulnerability disclosure and so we

179
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,419
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also capture you know with</font>

180
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,830
what's going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their world and and</font>

181
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,359
we did we were hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would get</font>

182
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">some real data from these surveys that</font>

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,220
would help us identify ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

184
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,330
greater awareness and adoption and so we

185
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,970
thought about different communities that

186
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,500
we would serve a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious to survey</font>

187
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,389
the technology providers and operators

188
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,760
and the security researchers as<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

189
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,210
very central players to this we also did

190
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,340
consider doing it

191
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">our survey the reasoning behind that was</font>

192
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,568
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if consumers care about</font>

193
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,060
security that of course helps to drive

194
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,470
adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security practices like</font>

195
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,069
having a vulnerability disclosure policy

196
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:07,020
in place for vendors so we were

197
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,539
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in knowing to what extent</font>

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,549
this is a consumer issue or a user issue

199
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:16,289
we ultimately decided to not do a user

200
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,810
survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> jen's going to talk in a few</font>

201
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,318
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes about all the sort of method</font>

202
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,699
methodology issues that we faced and

203
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,820
disseminating the survey and the bias

204
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,340
that we likely captured and surveying

205
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,870
the veteran<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we did but all of</font>

206
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,588
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues were really really</font>

207
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,299
exacerbated in the case of a user survey

208
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be really</font>

209
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,958
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this survey the and the</font>

210
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,579
destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the surveys was just done</font>

211
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,348
by the awareness and adoption working

212
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,580
group as part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTA process we</font>

213
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,640
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any funding or any</font>

214
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,380
expertise in and surveying and so you

215
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we were we were just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

216
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,279
doing what we could to promote the

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,990
surveys and so we felt that the

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">responses that we would get would just</font>

219
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,589
have incredible bias it would either be

220
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,029
totally random from users or would be

221
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that were already really really</font>

222
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,630
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this topic and that would</font>

223
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,339
that would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why they would</font>

224
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,279
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and respond to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey so</font>

225
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">we often Utley didn't do that what did</font>

226
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we did do the technology</font>

227
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:16,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">Frederator or vendor and the security</font>

228
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,850
researchers survey we tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

229
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,750
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveys really short really simple</font>

230
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think they were both like nine</font>

231
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:25,380
questions you can see in general we were

232
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,700
just looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out what what do</font>

233
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,399
you what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing and why what is</font>

234
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,839
your general expectation and what is

235
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your rationale for</font>

236
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the process of</font>

237
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,560
researching in the process of disclosing

238
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,470
or receiving and handling of

239
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,569
vulnerability just want to highlight

240
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,930
that you know these questions the fact

241
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:48,240
that they were so simple we think helped

242
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,380
gather a lot of responses but the flip

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,290
side of that is that you know there were

244
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,360
some limitations and the questions so

245
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,560
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance you know if we were trying</font>

246
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,850
to understand that there would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vast</font>

247
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,018
array of experiences

248
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,050
researchers would have and we want to

249
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:06,540
capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of them a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times we</font>

250
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,819
enable multiple responses to any single

251
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,589
question which then made the data hard

252
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:13,769
to interpret for instance we asked a

253
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:16,589
question about how interaction with a

254
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,779
vendor was and we had fifty five percent

255
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,519
of researchers say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it they had</font>

256
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really frustrating experiences and</font>

257
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,660
communicating with a vendor and we had

258
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,120
sixty percent say that they had a really

259
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,439
productive conversation with a vendor so

260
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,870
I can see those<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers don't quite work</font>

261
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,899
out and we but we took what we could

262
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,480
from from the responses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we received</font>

263
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,880
so as one said we surveyed the internet

264
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,410
and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been mocked for a huge</font>

265
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,910
amount the nice thing is when you survey

266
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet the entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet mocks</font>

267
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,469
you that sir very intimate and they also

268
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,990
healthfully provide feedback on your

269
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,940
survey after<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's already out in the</font>

270
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,350
public domain and I mean it's fine

271
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,910
because data scientists tell me that

272
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,350
there is no validity to the survey

273
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,079
anyway so we could have just started

274
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,050
changing it but we chose not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

275
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,519
because it seemed kind of skeezy so we

276
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,139
had a lot of learnings in the process

277
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know the reality is like as a man</font>

278
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:09,089
who said we were kind of highly limited

279
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:13,439
you are all playing spot the meme now on

280
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:16,560
you so yeah so we were sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

281
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:19,349
highly limited in that this is you know

282
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,410
it's a volunteer organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

283
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,269
owned by anyone sort of entity and so we

284
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,860
were limited in kind of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

285
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,220
on the surveying we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

286
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was free and open and easy so we</font>

287
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,410
did go the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> survey monkey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routes</font>

288
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,670
and I think if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> advising somebody</font>

289
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,589
who wanted to do this as more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

290
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,120
academic exercise I would have not to do

291
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,509
that but you would have to pour a lot of

292
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">money into it honestly and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a huge</font>

293
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,930
number of learnings along the way one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

294
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,250
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found out is the</font>

295
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,508
vendor survey didn't really work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

296
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,800
open source community and that was a

297
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:53,189
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> heartbreaking because we really</font>

298
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:57,709
wanted to capture them we also had used

299
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:57,709
some of serving monkeys kind of standard

300
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:05,040
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah demographic splits and for the</font>

301
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:07,019
verticals with a vendor one that was

302
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,199
really dumb<font color="#E5E5E5"> because one of the</font>

303
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,370
categories was<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology and a</font>

304
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,820
obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people identified</font>

305
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,490
that way interestingly not everyone did

306
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,770
so there were definitely some pretty

307
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,220
pretty huge learnings for us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

308
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:26,140
process but we did try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

309
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,520
like push beyond just putting it out

310
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,750
there and dumping it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaving it and</font>

311
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,140
we knew that that was never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

312
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:35,340
effective as a thing to do anyway so we

313
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,170
got really active with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

314
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,500
media<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote it trying to get people</font>

315
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,209
we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had wide followers to</font>

316
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,600
promote it we reached out to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sykes</font>

317
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,270
Amanda did a phenomenal job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

318
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,400
to a lot of vertical alliances a lot of

319
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,140
vertical ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> axe and getting their</font>

320
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,490
members to do it and we could see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

321
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,800
coming through as the results were

322
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:04,210
coming through oh is this me again

323
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">ah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do we do so on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher</font>

324
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,310
survey we had 414 responses now again we

325
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,500
surveyed the Internet's 414 may not

326
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,510
sound like a particularly high number

327
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,070
but when we went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we were very</font>

328
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,170
hesitant about what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would really get</font>

329
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,390
in terms of response and the stretch

330
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,400
goal that we had set ourselves was 250

331
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,939
for each survey so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were really</font>

332
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,650
delighted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 414 responses and the data</font>

333
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually did show kind of a pretty</font>

334
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,170
decent variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> in who we got in terms of</font>

335
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,640
whether they were people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who were doing</font>

336
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:44,589
research as part of their job and that

337
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:48,100
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so the the largest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

338
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:50,200
largest percentage of geographic split

339
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,180
for both surveys was definitely the US

340
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,320
which was not super surprising since the

341
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,510
NCAA is the US government<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity however</font>

342
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,210
we did see some other governments pay

343
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,400
some interest in it and and some people

344
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,350
kind of promoting it internationally so

345
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,699
for the researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got 210 us</font>

346
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:12,660
responses and then you'll see the splits

347
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,320
here so half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people who responded</font>

348
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,130
listed themselves a sort of

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">quote/unquote independent researchers it</font>

350
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,189
was nice the thing that I thought was

351
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,230
awesome was that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually got people</font>

352
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,700
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> were accidental finders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responding</font>

353
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,740
those were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people we thought would</font>

354
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,790
be super hard to reach we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

355
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that like the way that we were</font>

356
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,870
disseminating it we would easily find

357
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,130
those people so it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> good that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

358
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who don't consider themselves to</font>

359
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,670
be professional researchers took the

360
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,970
survey and that data is I think very

361
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,530
valuable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in terms of the tools</font>

362
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,250
we had asked this question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how all</font>

363
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,600
kinds of tools people use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font>

364
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:50,290
the tools is really the right word for

365
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,640
some of these things and this question

366
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,290
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

367
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,670
became a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little crazy and bloated over</font>

368
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,319
time when we were preparing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

369
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,839
ended up covering a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird</font>

370
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,040
mismatch of things but you can see I'm

371
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to talk through all the stats</font>

372
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,530
because they're right on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen in</font>

373
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:14,230
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me so you can read them so yeah</font>

374
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:20,170
now getting into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual data that we</font>

375
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:23,650
got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the researchers survey we asked</font>

376
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:27,550
a question about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how researchers</font>

377
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">disclose what's their first action and</font>

378
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,370
disclosure and then also a separate

379
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,620
question about what their expectations

380
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,660
are and disclosing and how that

381
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,820
influences their behavior so with the

382
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,260
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question the response we</font>

383
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,520
got back is with captured in the graph

384
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,970
which is like 67% just disclosed to the

385
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,449
vendor something like 10 and 13 h %

386
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,180
disclosed to a bug bounty provider or to

387
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,610
a coordinating organization like<font color="#CCCCCC"> CC and</font>

388
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,420
then just four percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> approximately</font>

389
00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:01,480
either just don't disclose or go public

390
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,640
and full disclosure so we were excited

391
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we kind of consider</font>

392
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,610
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

393
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,440
with caption in that circle was that

394
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:15,970
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of predominant norm but then oh</font>

395
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:18,850
sorry we did look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know what how</font>

396
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:22,620
you know expectations change behavior

397
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:26,110
and we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a researcher</font>

398
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,300
submits of vulnerability to a vendor and

399
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,220
then and doing so they also provide a

400
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,880
time frame and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that time frame is</font>

401
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,450
not met by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor then</font>

402
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,400
we'll go public so 24 ish percent of

403
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,910
researchers said that they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> had done</font>

404
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,650
that around seven percent said that they

405
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,540
the vendor provided a timeline when they

406
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,920
disclosed and then the vendor didn't

407
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,890
meet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeframe and so then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

408
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,020
went public but about eight percent said

409
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the vendor provided a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame</font>

410
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,250
when they disclosed the vendor did not

411
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,680
meet that time frame and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font>

412
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,940
but ultimately did not go public and I

413
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,170
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just coincidence that it</font>

414
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:07,620
looks as if the researchers were giving

415
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:09,389
us a singer so unsurprisingly well I

416
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,040
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was unsurprising but then I</font>

417
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,350
work in communications people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that</font>

418
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,819
communication is valued shockingly

419
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,379
people like to know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

420
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:20,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like they've been heard so we had</font>

421
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-five percent said that they</font>

422
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:25,520
expected notification when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue was</font>

423
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,520
resolved which seems kind of reasonable

424
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,180
sixty-eight percent said that they would

425
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,920
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like regular updates that</font>

426
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,480
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty decent reasonable</font>

427
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,610
thing so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that something's</font>

428
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,780
happening and fifty-seven percent

429
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually kind of went further and said</font>

430
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,170
they'd actually like to be involved in

431
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,439
testing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facts to make sure that it</font>

432
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,790
really is his<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co sharing works and and</font>

433
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,800
that was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

434
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,720
there were researchers who were like

435
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,040
we're super happy to stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

436
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,110
the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to partner with the</font>

437
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,490
vendor we're not just like hey this

438
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,949
shits on fire and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> running away</font>

439
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,650
screaming which is cool like we

440
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:05,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate that about researchers and</font>

441
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,780
then eighty-four percent in a similar

442
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">vein said yeah totally happy to answer</font>

443
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,200
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for then from fenders want to</font>

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,720
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> engaged once stay part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

445
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,010
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then trying to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

446
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,800
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the old and when I can't get out</font>

447
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,600
that so yeah so communication was really

448
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,820
important people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really value that they</font>

449
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,120
expected the vendor to be open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

450
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,419
transparent with them and apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

451
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,419
have now done

452
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:36,809
there we go yes I don't computer thanks

453
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:39,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Josh I was this me again damn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how do</font>

454
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,609
I get some slides um so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

455
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,779
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Shiva there's a reason this</font>

456
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:46,349
one's me because I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

457
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this issue all the time so we hear a lot</font>

458
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chilling effect of</font>

459
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,799
specifically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA and the DMCA and</font>

460
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:57,450
specifically with both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those with</font>

461
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,739
that they have civil action in them

462
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,899
which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of vendors use</font>

463
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:02,999
them to threaten researchers when

464
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:04,439
they're afraid of disclosures so we hear

465
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:05,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot about that but it's always a</font>

466
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,649
little hard to know whether that's

467
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:11,489
something that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit sort of</font>

468
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:13,258
funny and overhyped it's not sixty-four

469
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:16,019
percent said that fear of legal

470
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:19,769
repercussions is a serious serious issue

471
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:23,070
for them and it it seems as if it is

472
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:26,299
something that makes them<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

473
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,299
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not to disclose to the vendor</font>

474
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:38,039
the last twenty six percent responded

475
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:42,299
from prison<font color="#CCCCCC"> not true by the way for the</font>

476
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:45,389
recording it's not true uh so yeah um

477
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:48,119
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also had twenty four percent</font>

478
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,758
said that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stumbling</font>

479
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,139
into confidential information um only

480
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty four percent the others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

481
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:57,080
whatever that's great let's see what I

482
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:59,728
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that's why I do the</font>

483
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,428
thirty-one percent said that they are

484
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">afraid that exploits will be used</font>

485
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:05,999
nefariously I don't know if we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

486
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:12,570
word nefariously in the survey but I

487
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:17,969
hope we did another finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> in asking</font>

488
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:20,339
what does it a researcher expects in

489
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:22,649
return for disclosing a vulnerability

490
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,749
was that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about the money</font>

491
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:27,209
yeah consistent with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Jen was saying</font>

492
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:30,149
about communication we had seventy

493
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,440
percent say that they expected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font>

494
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:33,478
from the vendor after they submitted a

495
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,470
report fifty-three percent said that

496
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:39,270
they

497
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,919
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some recognition only i</font>

498
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,950
think twenty percent so they expected

499
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,960
nothing and then fifteen percent said

500
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,460
they expected a monetary reward and you

501
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,440
can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see by those numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and how</font>

502
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,789
they add up that this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

503
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,950
answers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could check many boxes</font>

504
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:54,270
so you weren't limited and saying you

505
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you wanted one thing you</font>

506
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,090
couldn't want another and still only

507
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,950
fifteen percent said they wanted they

508
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,959
expected a monetary reward when it is a

509
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,549
different story<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably but expected</font>

510
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,429
yes our<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest how many people are</font>

511
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:06,840
surprised by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> show of hands like</font>

512
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest surprises</font>

513
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,590
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really surprised that</font>

514
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,200
because we hear so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much dialogue in the</font>

515
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,789
community about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

516
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,380
selling vulnerabilities because there's

517
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:17,580
a market for it now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't have</font>

518
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,600
bug bounties and we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

519
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,730
comparable and all that kind of stuff

520
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reality is only fifteen percent</font>

521
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,840
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of awesome</font>

522
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,059
by the way like that means that this

523
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,428
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this stuff for much</font>

524
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,030
higher purpose and that is fantastic i

525
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,690
love you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were amazing</font>

526
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:38,428
fortunately a man is talking through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

527
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:40,169
next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we're now moving to the</font>

528
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,690
the survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the technology providers</font>

529
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,330
and operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the vendors so I</font>

530
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,700
demographic and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know no it's good</font>

531
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay um demographic information as you</font>

532
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,380
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there was the issue that of the</font>

533
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:56,330
survey monkey self populated a

534
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,980
technology being a huge like that

535
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,350
percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our respondents that may</font>

536
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,419
be slightly skewed because we did try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

537
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,070
reach these newer kind of technology

538
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,620
providers than that but it will say

539
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:12,720
quick anecdote on this one of the

540
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:15,120
meetings that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had I had I asked a</font>

541
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,169
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about technology providers in</font>

542
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the room and they're asked shield</font>

543
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else for show of hands as i am</font>

544
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,990
want to do and there were a whole bunch

545
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,730
of people who didn't put their hands up

546
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,559
and I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were from what I</font>

547
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,720
would count as technology providers and

548
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,760
so doing the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen tells us</font>

549
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,980
not to do I put them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spot I was</font>

550
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">like did you know answer that because</font>

551
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,549
you don't you can't like publicly answer

552
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,620
it or do you just not identify the

553
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:39,150
technology provider and they said we

554
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't identify as technology providers</font>

555
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:45,120
and that was to me super interesting

556
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,280
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> automakers and they like totally</font>

557
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,850
have this this that way car makers

558
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,740
that's what we do

559
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,780
that's how we've self-identified for a

560
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,760
long time so even though now we're

561
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,280
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have millions</font>

562
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,379
of lines of code in them we don't

563
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,000
consider ourselves to be quote unquote

564
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,039
technology providers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

565
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,240
actually he as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as it seems kind of</font>

566
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,010
like really obvious we would get this

567
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,900
result it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly surprising</font>

568
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:11,490
to us so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the the researchers</font>

569
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,250
survey predominantly our responses were

570
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:18,260
coming from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US we did get some 10 to</font>

571
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:21,030
15 ish responses from UK Germany Japan

572
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,500
Canada I think and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

573
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,610
to highlight here is the divide between

574
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,580
large and small organizations we had if

575
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,908
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a thousand employees as</font>

576
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:36,149
the dividing mark there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think does it</font>

578
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,470
that 125 were larger but that our

579
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,409
respondents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was heavily weighted</font>

580
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,730
towards having yeah being<font color="#E5E5E5"> really large</font>

581
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,789
or really small so having more than

<font color="#E5E5E5">10,000 employees or less than fewer than</font>

583
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:54,870
100 employees sure just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very briefly on</font>

584
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,559
the math side of things one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways</font>

585
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,570
broke down the respondents using

586
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,720
clustering analysis due to the wonderful

587
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,899
Brutus is to say hey listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> we noticed</font>

588
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,700
that roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of the participants</font>

589
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be mature they've thought about</font>

590
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,570
vulnerability disclosure and roughly and

591
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,400
have implemented a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

592
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,220
practices for different reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

593
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,900
roughly half were not mature they didn't

594
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,460
have many practices so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

595
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about you know what does a</font>

596
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,640
mature organization look like versus an

597
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,630
immature organization when it comes to

598
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,669
vulnerability disclosure Thank You<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellen</font>

599
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:32,580
and one other thing to highlight there

600
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:35,220
is that we didn't necessarily in the

601
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,439
respondent star survey see a split among

602
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,440
large or small organizations being over

603
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,580
well overwhelmingly mature or immature

604
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
recognizing that likely outside of the

605
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,189
context of our survey and what we

606
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,840
captured there might be more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

607
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference but there were a lot of small</font>

608
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,449
organizations that still kind of met

609
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,940
this maturity model criteria so one of

610
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that we captured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

611
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,930
are mature organizations doing so we

612
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,180
were had a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bar of some</font>

613
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,430
five percent are higher for for what we

614
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,340
were wanting to highlight having a

615
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:08,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated monitor monitored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paths for</font>

providing end users with alerts

619
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,710
providing researchers recognition and

620
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,629
vulnerable and having vulnerability

621
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,660
reports and for mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> kurtz security</font>

622
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:29,710
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle we're all really</font>

623
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:30,700
have lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations were active</font>

624
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,610
consistent with those best practices

625
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:36,040
versus for the immature organizations or

626
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the less mature organizations for each</font>

627
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:43,320
of these they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were between eight to</font>

628
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,320
twelve percent following these behaviors

629
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:56,020
okay so why are they doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

630
00:25:50,799 --> 00:26:01,120
the ones little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mature why so excuse me</font>

631
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:02,889
sorry so basically the biggest thing is

632
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to be that your customers</font>

633
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,539
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know people people vote</font>

634
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,030
with their feet and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that</font>

635
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:13,780
your customers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to buy you</font>

636
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:17,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to change your behavior so in</font>

637
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:19,240
the more mature bucket we had

638
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventy-nine percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that their</font>

639
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,250
customers care about this issue whereas

640
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,030
in the less mature nine percent we're

641
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:30,280
kind of like our whatevs um and we could

642
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,870
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> theorize who falls into which</font>

643
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,470
bucket but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for in the</font>

644
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,479
bar later the other the other big ones

645
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,250
were I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly like corporate</font>

646
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,929
social responsibility there was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

647
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">little woolly year on that but not not</font>

648
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:44,919
super low so the more mature was

649
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,870
sixty-five percent and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't see</font>

650
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:51,789
the number for the lower one and for the

651
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,699
further it reduces the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost which we</font>

652
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,620
thought would be a really big thing the

653
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:01,539
more mature was just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little over half</font>

654
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:03,520
fifty fifty four percent so we asked

655
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,970
them which best practices they were

656
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at and we gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them three</font>

657
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,429
options so one they were deriving their

658
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,539
best practices internally to we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

659
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:16,419
the multiple options but these were the

660
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,710
top ones so one they were deriving them

661
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:20,080
internally to they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

662
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,490
ISOs and three they were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what</font>

663
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">other companies are doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,110
guess which<font color="#E5E5E5"> stat goes with which thing</font>

665
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:33,220
so other companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone want to shout</font>

666
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:36,879
out stat know the one that none of you

667
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:41,620
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty nine percent said they were</font>

668
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,260
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at other companies I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so's 49</font>

669
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,439
absolutely which was a little surprising

670
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us honestly and says a lot about the</font>

671
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,419
availability in there and the awareness

672
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,340
around the ISOs and then seventy-six

673
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,559
percent were deriving their practices

674
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,668
just looking internally or what made

675
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,769
sense for their business which is

676
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:03,440
actually kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Awesome</font>

have this it's actually we're going to

679
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,019
be doing this bit after you've heard

what you're working group has been

focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a shin of a public</font>

coordinated vulnerable exposure

00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:03,619
multi-stakeholder consensus based

696
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,480
process was that we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

697
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,549
relitigate the vulnerability disclosure

wars we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reopen old wounds</font>

699
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:12,429
we didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible</font>

700
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,570
disclosure fights so there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

701
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,220
polarization coming in but what one

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized through the</font>

work we've been doing with I am the

704
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:20,809
cavalry<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these safety</font>

00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:27,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending cease and desist</font>

letters to our friends and now they're

giving them six-figure cash prizes and

celebrating remember

711
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,280
and it's a vitally necessary part of

712
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,660
their research and development and their

<font color="#E5E5E5">product and your customer satisfaction</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lighten in about 12 to 15 years and</font>

717
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,770
for these think you could like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

718
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,630
at here 0 or year one and I don't expect

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can afford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 years for</font>

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one or two so what I</font>

722
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,300
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on the table early is that</font>

723
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,639
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where bits invites me flesh and</font>

724
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,649
blood and where the consequences of

725
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,780
failure will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be measured in credit cards</font>

726
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,180
or records loss but in your lives in

national gdp in crisis of confidence in

728
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,320
key markets that are necessary for our

729
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,669
way of life and may even lead to a

730
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,620
compromise or our civil liberties and

731
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:18,410
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> value designation or as a global</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to go with it that safety</font>

734
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,370
critical industries could be a superset

735
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,910
of the requirements and constraints on

736
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:31,100
designing a journey to go from crawl to

737
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,640
walk to run if you're playing Josh for

738
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,230
my bingo that is the center square but

739
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,720
the crawl walk run<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is what we</font>

740
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,600
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in the cavalry has worked</font>

744
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you can create a high trust high</font>

745
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,439
collaboration so then you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have better</font>

746
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,060
outcomes and essentially the simplest

747
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,590
way I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it beware</font>

748
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,700
of dog sign

what's a minimum viable product that

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,309
fits on one page it can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

753
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,289
template so you can sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to your</font>

754
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,789
general counsel without a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,908
attached surface and red lines and

756
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:15,140
entropy such that maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start it</font>

757
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,820
on your journey one of the things we've

758
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,400
learned from these folks is if you can

759
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,870
never retract you can always expand but

760
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,150
you can't ever retract so if you offer

761
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,779
cash you can't get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you have</font>

762
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,640
a narrow scope you can't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more no</font>

763
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,110
not really so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> safety critical</font>

764
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,970
working groups of people seem to agree

765
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,740
that maybe it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful in the</font>

766
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,240
snow flake but if you can solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,070
forever days an uncatchable

770
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that then it may also be useful for non</font>

771
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">safety critical attitude and we've had</font>

772
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">some consternation over this we've done</font>

773
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,809
some duplicate of work with our coop

774
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,120
makes us for it but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jen and</font>

775
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,740
Amanda's survey work has been very

776
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,729
proper<font color="#CCCCCC"> ative to some of our assumptions</font>

777
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,690
very much so this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

778
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,010
frustrating for me to a collaborative

779
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">process because I had this burning</font>

780
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,029
platform I did not that I can't

781
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:06,260
collaborate but one thing's I tried to

782
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">remind the group and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die in this</font>

783
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">group is whether you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have according to</font>

784
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:12,200
vulnerable disclosure program or not

785
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,700
thanks to the BMC exception dmca

786
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,120
exceptions coming in october which is

787
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,559
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months from now you're going to get</font>

788
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,689
a surge or a tidal wave of

789
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,710
vulnerabilities and the data the survey

790
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:27,000
shows it was at sixty-four percent are

791
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,030
afraid of legal reprisal

792
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,190
that fear is reduced you will see

793
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,920
submissions and without betraying<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

794
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,140
confidences the rumor is that in the

795
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">first 48 hours of GM's program with no</font>

796
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,840
port with no vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> price or not</font>

797
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,520
they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 100 submissions and I</font>

798
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,320
asked them<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you got a lot of</font>

799
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,850
submissions won't say how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many how many</font>

800
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,919
of those do you think were found in the

801
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,510
last 14 hours and that was really the

802
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,670
key question because you can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

803
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,890
automotive<font color="#CCCCCC"> lodging forty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars these</font>

804
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,950
were known but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were afraid to</font>

805
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:00,630
share so the same is true for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

806
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,430
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks that simply reduce the</font>

807
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,070
barrier so what we wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is show</font>

808
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,450
some sort of again minimum viable

809
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,639
product and this is a template that

810
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've used with others outside of the</font>

811
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">collaborative process and I was really</font>

812
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,919
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add spur to see that even</font>

813
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">though this process may take a while and</font>

814
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,740
will take some time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you deserve a back</font>

815
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,230
we wanted to cause some sort of action

816
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,480
prior to october first because if you

817
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,269
want to build capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of muscles before</font>

818
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,879
the flood this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the type of music</font>

819
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:29,639
so we basically need a really really

820
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,839
ugly word doc got a lot of fighting but

821
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">I essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said this should fit on</font>

822
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,918
one page and there's originally were

823
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:38,158
four blocks but do a brand promise do an

824
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,669
initial program scope keyword initial

825
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take legal action in</font>

826
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:45,839
unambiguous terms and then the

827
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,179
mechanisms for submission and ongoing

828
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,830
communication and then we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

829
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,989
this last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> where recently because</font>

830
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">things have changed submission</font>

831
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,379
preferences so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect your</font>

832
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:59,458
legal posture but kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs you will</font>

833
00:33:55,379 --> 00:34:03,389
and well prioritize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept so really</font>

834
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:05,489
quickly the brand promise idea is safety

835
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:06,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">is super important to us in addition to</font>

836
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:08,490
all the wonderful things we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

837
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,138
with our own staff and with their credit

838
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,939
contractors who want to cast as wide an

839
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,799
it is possible and invite the

840
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,559
participation of willing allies in a

841
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:18,089
whole of community approach to try to

842
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,589
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs and be safe or sooner together</font>

843
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,750
that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a</font>

844
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:22,739
marketing<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that can get you a lot</font>

845
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,319
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people looking this is a legal thing</font>

846
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,689
or an engineering contract this is very

847
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:29,639
much a brand of reinforcement thing

848
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,589
people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pleased to see GM's</font>

849
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,980
burger they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very pleased to see</font>

850
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:36,029
Johnson Johnson's burger so this

851
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,889
reassures to your customers that you

852
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:40,109
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this opinion seriously the</font>

853
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,429
initial program scope because these are

854
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">safety critical industries who have no</font>

855
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,740
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many bugs are gonna get</font>

856
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,779
submitted to them they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

857
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:47,908
they can internally triage them we've

858
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:49,559
encouraged an explicit scope reduction

859
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,329
don't ask for<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugs and all the things</font>

860
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,849
you've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> made maybe pick the most</font>

861
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:55,750
recent model here maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take one</font>

862
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:58,000
make your model of your car

863
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,920
that way it becomes a throttling

864
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,810
mechanism which you can expand after

865
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,480
your pocket no one judge the Pentagon

866
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,220
for having a 20-day pilot they did a

867
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,900
pilot and based on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they learn</font>

868
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,240
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do another phase in all</font>

869
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,830
likelihood so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is start narrow</font>

870
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,569
start on something that's newer and more

871
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,130
modern perhaps something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel</font>

872
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,990
the engineering teams to triage and

873
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,640
based on the received bugs and the

874
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">quality of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> received bugs you can</font>

875
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,660
always expand scope over time by stating

879
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,570
beginning our journey there's also

880
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,320
implicit scope which I will skip for now

881
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,760
there's the most one of the most

882
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,860
important parts is we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not take</font>

and these ones what we're finding should

897
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,340
be fairly computable and evergreen if

confusion some of these programs on day

our engineers got flooded they started

adding exception after exception after

stopped dead in their tracks<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're tackling as well about</font>

with perfect solutions what we have seen

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,600
how folks like Microsoft and others have

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,089
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dampen the risk</font>

938

so to that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think many of those</font>

things were just alluded to you without

let me just do 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds on this we cut</font>

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">very necessary a survey I basically say</font>

they all start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peat there's</font>

949
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,540
and curiosity there's prestige you do it

950
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
to win a white jacket ER to give a

956
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm deliberately and overtly encouraging

that the first born<font color="#E5E5E5"> a disclosure program</font>

attract the subset of researchers who

are protectors and puzzlers they won't

give you are maturing conference

963

966
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,040
we've also encouraged the lack of

<font color="#E5E5E5">coolest rewards that anybody gets as</font>

things like this challenge point from

970
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,420
Tesla or things like a t-shirt from

than they would prize a small cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> award</font>

975

00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,180
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that GM was not criticized for</font>

art Manning from search who has

that merged reduce duplication increase

support from first like<font color="#CCCCCC"> web XE stuff and</font>

1025
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:43,650
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a person taking notes</font>

1026
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:45,750
so that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice why why look at</font>

coordinated vulnerably disclosure for

1031
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:59,640
kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sure think we're sure</font>

1032
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,250
that disclosure is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is</font>

1033
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,170
an effective defense that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1034
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,520
might be challenging coming up there's

1035
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,220
some general agreement on the model you

1036
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,320
find a bug you report it you wait and

1037
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,859
the vendor fixes it and you disclose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1038
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,690
after that people disagree pretty

1039
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,340
quickly on how long do you wait do you

1040
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,430
disclose when do you disclose how much

1041
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so framework might be four</font>

1042

1043
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,799
place so y coordinate disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> y</font>

1044
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,790
multi-party disclosure more vendors

1045
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,310
means more complexity I asked my more

1046
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,840
math informed colleagues they said it

1047
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,610
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not exponential growth but it is</font>

1048
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,640
greater than linear growth when you add

1049
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:43,290
people to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix keeping secrets</font>

1050
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,150
gets very hard after the second person

1051
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,710
finds out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something when it's the</font>

1053
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:52,250

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:54,870
managing<font color="#CCCCCC"> coms gets very difficult and</font>

1055
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:56,610

1056
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,980
construct to get become in conflict

format protocols these days different

to the planet GM is new to disclosure

1074
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,700
the process we went through to try to

1075
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:42,959
come up with something useful was not a

survey but sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a conceptually</font>

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to derive something useful from</font>

what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the group's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">real-world experiences are so different</font>

1081
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,549
types of coordination and disclosure

1082
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:58,140
cases variants that come up from those

1083
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,780
cases because the exception<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rule</font>

1084
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,040
in lots of places especially here you

1085
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,210
are always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a variant it's</font>

1086
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,390
very rare you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a coordinating</font>

1087
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,690
coordination disclosure case that's

1088
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,609
goes smoothly and perfectly for each

1089
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,140
variant what caused it how could you

1090
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,730
prevent it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future how do you</font>

1091
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,049
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it lists and lists of things</font>

1092
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,730
cluster those lists us sort of things

1093
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,010
rise to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top and that from there you</font>

1094
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,090
so you get your practices and

1095
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,230
potentially further from there we're

1096
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,580
going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> principals out of this</font>

1097
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:30,650
thing here's a very simple example so a

1098
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,390
very clean relatively clean case

1099
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,700
multi-party coordinated disclosure is

1100
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on variant for a vendor leaks</font>

1101
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,680
early what's the cause they send

1102
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,690
something in plain text prevention is

1103
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,569
encryption and responses cats out of the

1104
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:49,100
bag everybody run so guess what someone

1105
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,540
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rated to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heat</font>

1106

this is a human sort of organizational

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,570
problem missed expectations huge huge

thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish and follow your policy at</font>

1109
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,590
least tell other people what's going on

1110
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,359
doesn't mean you agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means that</font>

1114
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,720
or common reference might help but we

1115

don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> them going to agree</font>

out at the same time I think

00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:36,260
communication is huge frequent is

1126
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:37,310
probably better people feeling they know

00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,870
have other things to do but multi-party

1140
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,040
is a case where often having a neutral

this means

1148
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,999
reach the researchers your suppliers you

1149
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,920
want to know when somebody upstream put

1150
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:27,379
a new version of lib PNG and the thing

1151
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,429
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your dashboard you want them</font>

1152
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell you that so you know what you</font>

1154
00:45:32,209 --> 00:45:35,828
we've already covered this in previous

1155
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:38,899
slides but chilling effects are a thing

1156
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:40,429
be cognizant of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not telling</font>

can do various intimidation<font color="#E5E5E5"> rewards</font>

1160
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,179
reward structures an idea that groups

00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">thrown around is to exclude repeat</font>

1169
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,529
careful with that you do especially

1170
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:12,049
disclosing sorts of things provide good

1171
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:13,459
information we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE or something to</font>

1172
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:15,679
tie things together we like machine

1173
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:17,779
readable information and lastly I'm

1174
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:19,160
going to throw up we have the group has

1175
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:22,160
not worked through these principles

1176
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,219
slides so take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with a they're very</font>

1177
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,219
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in draft state but harm</font>

1178
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:29,660
reduction being prepared you have some

1179
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,969
responsibility to inform others if you

1180
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,288
buy into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole defensive disclosure</font>

1181
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:34,519
is a good thing in the first place you

1182
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">may not agree in the first place in</font>

1183
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:37,879
which case these principles multiply but

1184
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,439
if you follow that these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds</font>

1185
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,140
of things we think are sort of over well

00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:46,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">overarching sort of human goals that you</font>

00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:48,859
might want to consider feedback is

first cig you don't be a member of first

1193
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,699
to join and be part of our I think twice

1194
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:03,410
a month calls at this point and

1195
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:04,519
contribute that way obviously this is

1196
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,410
open comment period you can contribute

1197
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:10,299
that way that's my email address if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1198
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,299
have other questions and thank you

1199
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,700
so I want to thank art and you can stay

1200
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:22,670
up here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is the time where</font>

1201
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:25,040
there were some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions earlier but we</font>

1202
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:28,130
can do some quick takeaways from the

1203
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,810
survey earlier and the awareness an

1204
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,070
adoption group and really one of the

1205
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons that we wanted to come out here</font>

1206
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:36,140
is because while there has been active

1207
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,420
researcher participation of people who

1208
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,370
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security not just because</font>

1209
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,230
they make stuff but because they're

1210
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:43,400
genuinely interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security we</font>

1211
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,780
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we heard from</font>

1212
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security community and so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1213
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,400
the three working groups that you've

1214
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:55,280
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from and here's a refresher of the</font>

1215
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,080
takeaways on the the awareness and

1216
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,660
adoption group of what they found it's

1217
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,520
behind us and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have thoughts</font>

1218
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,240
and we can revisit some of the specific

1219
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,830
questions of how can we reach safety

1220
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,140
organizations organizations that are new

1221
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:13,069
to it and build templates and get them

1222
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:16,069
aware of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crawl stage how can we</font>

1223
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:18,110
coordinate across multiple parties and

1224
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,290
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the basic frameworks</font>

1225
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:24,770
for that and and of course how do we

1226
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:26,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just raise overall awareness so I'm</font>

1227
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,890
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay in here and try to</font>

1228
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:38,390
moderate and Jen's gonna swear at the

1229
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:43,100
end with an axe when it makes nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

1230
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:44,359
tweet for you why that uh so please so I

1231
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:49,000
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a question earlier but</font>

1232
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to return the mic out here</font>

1233
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so first of all I have to do the</font>

1234
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,520
legal disclaimer my opinions not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1235
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,060
companies mostly because my regulator is

1236
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:04,220
sitting two seats down for me so I work

1237
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,230
for a very large pharma company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1238
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,149
am trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince to get involved in</font>

1239
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,250
this so I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some feedback and I have</font>

1240
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,420
a challenge for Alan and I think for Jan

1241
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,420
as well so

1242
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:19,820
yeah and so I know you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing</font>

1243
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,740
great work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i've been following</font>

1244
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,859
what you're doing and it's fantastic and

1245
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:28,310
amazing however you guys need more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1246
00:49:24,859 --> 00:49:34,730
eco you need to publicize what you're

1247
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:36,500
doing yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah no it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be a</font>

1248
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem for some individuals but for as</font>

1249
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,760
a working group genuinely of serious

1250
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:44,270
feedback you're not selling it enough

1251
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you guys need a website you need to</font>

1252
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:48,320
do more engagement I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> NT OA</font>

1253
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:50,839
doesn't have money to put behind it but

1254
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,820
we you need to find some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

1255
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:56,089
be able to go to my VPS and my business

1256
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and say I want us as a very</font>

1257
00:49:56,089 --> 00:50:01,700
large corporation that could support

1258
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:04,609
this to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in this so so the</font>

1259
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,169
challenges are you particularly and I do

1260
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:09,319
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work with icon as well which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1261
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:12,859
also an FEI you know my boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> then yeah</font>

1262
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:15,050
I'm good friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> Larry and so they do</font>

1263
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,910
amazing stuff on multi stakeholder

1264
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,440
engagement and I think there's really

1265
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,319
learnings that could come from that side

1266
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,589
over into what you guys are doing and

1267
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,700
then just from the community involvement

1268
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:28,069
just looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the slides and on the</font>

1269
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,500
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that you got I</font>

1270
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:33,230
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need more people in my position</font>

1271
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,020
some more healthcare vendors more

1272
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,520
automotive manufacturers more people

1273
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are part of that whole mix of</font>

1274
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,990
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were manufacturing or</font>

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,240
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare we are now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

1276
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,879
providers which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally agree with we</font>

1277
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,160
need to work out as a group how do we

1278
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,140
get those people involved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes</font>

1279
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">back then to the first thing is how do</font>

1280
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,210
we sell this as something not just as a

1281
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,099
this impacts the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and technology</font>

1282
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,780
people within a company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1283
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:01,520
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1284
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,569
work on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just call out as</font>

1285
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">well because I didn't get a chance at</font>

1286
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:08,509
the am the cavalry thing yesterday what

1287
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:10,930
Suzanne has done with the stuff with the

1288
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">FTA has quite literally revolutionized</font>

1289
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:17,868
how security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being spoken about him i</font>

1290
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:20,180
interfere here so I I have a 30-second

1291
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:22,730
anecdotes that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend 10</font>

1292
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,410
years in many pharma companies trying to

1293
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:27,300
push this discussion that we're having

1294
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,279
here six weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I got an email</font>

1295
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,040
from my vice president of rag affairs

1296
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,470
and our director<font color="#E5E5E5"> of QA asking me what we</font>

1297
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,900
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in this place not the other</font>

1298
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:39,689
way around that 10 which is changed in

1299
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:41,760
the last say six months to a year so

1300
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,380
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we are now and I also</font>

1301
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,200
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interactions between</font>

1302
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,090
these two groups are how we're going to

1303
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,160
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward as a security community and</font>

1304
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,710
that's really important that we take

1305
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,450
this and grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now and set the path</font>

1306
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,520
for the next particular for my industry

1307
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:59,160
we work slowly the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years a nice</font>

1308
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,740
starting now I really appreciate that is

1309
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,040
fantastic feedback thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

1310
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to let the the experts respond but I'm</font>

1311
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to say that the final step as</font>

1312
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:12,390
we draft this process is to say okay how

1313
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:15,509
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take the document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been</font>

1314
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:16,589
built with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> input of those of you who</font>

1315
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:19,290
really know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

1316
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:22,140
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get broader adoption now</font>

1317
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:23,759
in some cases we're lucky because we are

1318
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,040
the Department of Commerce and because

1319
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a voluntary approach we can get</font>

1320
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,320
industry to wave it at their regulators

1321
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,960
who aren't as friendly as Suzanne and

1322
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:37,470
and the Chamber<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Commerce for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1323
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,630
hates regulation loves this approach and

1324
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:43,049
any advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys have in terms</font>

1325
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:45,210
of how we can take this and and build it

1326
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:48,000
so that it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not just</font>

1327
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,820
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tech community but outside and</font>

1328
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">global because it is always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard for</font>

1329
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,990
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the US government to</font>

1330
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:59,490
remember that we are not the entire

1331
00:52:54,990 --> 00:53:06,870
world so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take this global</font>

1332
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:08,879
variable but it was so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

1333
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:11,040
for any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who were not able to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">catch Suzanne session they used to check</font>

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,900
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video it was really really</font>

1336
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:21,879
awesome and she has done incredible

1337
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:24,490
at the FDA and and they are certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1338
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,910
my knowledge the regulatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> body that is</font>

1339
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:31,330
most ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> with adopting site security</font>

1340
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:34,060
norms for their their vertical and it is

1341
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:36,340
super inspiring to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly so you</font>

1342
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:38,020
should definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> check out her talk in</font>

1343
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,220
terms of what you're saying one of the

1344
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,330
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a manner and I have talked</font>

1345
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">about fair amount is at some point ntia</font>

1346
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,680
has to move on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that for them to</font>

1347
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,580
continue forever is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best use of</font>

1348
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,169
taxpayers dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as the example of</font>

1349
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">representative taxation with no</font>

1350
00:53:53,170 --> 00:54:00,040
representation I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1351
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:02,530
other things so I i think you know at

1352
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,630
some point there has to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

1353
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:07,570
where we decide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this can stand on</font>

1354
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:09,070
its own two feet without<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia and so you</font>

1355
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:11,680
know something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a matter and I have</font>

1356
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,610
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is for adoption you know as</font>

1357
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,859
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said at the beginning when we first</font>

1358
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:16,450
start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about surveys our whole</font>

1359
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,950
thing was about coming up with ways to

1360
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,080
drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption it wasn't about coming up</font>

1361
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:22,240
with surveys the surveys were means to

1362
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,450
an end and they ended up taking so much

1363
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,620
time there now at this point where we're

1364
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,060
kind of like we hope that this doesn't

1365
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,529
lose momentum we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

1366
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,270
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the surveys were it and it's</font>

1367
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">done and then they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like our well</font>

1368
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,080
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will figure out option and</font>

1369
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:37,210
move on like this is what it's all for

1370
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,220
so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to solve that problem and</font>

1371
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:40,350
we have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how do the people</font>

1372
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,060
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this topic</font>

1373
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:45,190
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work together and I agree</font>

1374
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,870
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that there needs to be some</font>

1375
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,020
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of centralizing point that people</font>

1376
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:52,240
focus on I think the challenge is when

1377
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,650
you have shared ownership how you do

1378
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how you can let's get a</font>

1379
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,770
particular when you don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1380
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,910
resources behind it so it's definitely

1381
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,500
something that we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I</font>

1382
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,670
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you completely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that front</font>

1383
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,360
but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> kapadia is going to be a</font>

1384
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge</font>

1385
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a question back in a way I'm</font>

1386
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,350
guessing that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1387
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,879
above but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned that your VP of</font>

1388
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:16,100
regulatory affairs is someone who is

1389
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,100
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you but I ideally it would be</font>

1390
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:21,500
like the different business perspective

1391
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,060
coming to you and saying for our

1392
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,270
reputation or for the value of our

1393
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:30,420
product or so on we are also concerned

1394
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:33,690
in engage so my question back is what is

1395
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,750
the way to reach that maybe is it going

1396
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:38,940
and talking about others in your

1397
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,550
industry like peers that are doing this

1398
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,410
well what they're getting from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it</font>

1399
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">just more publicity like what are one of</font>

1400
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:50,370
the mechanisms that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

1401
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:51,900
meaningful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those bp's we're an eye</font>

1402
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,150
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike you for if those</font>

1403
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,070
watching at home thank you so two points

1404
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,620
from my industry we are pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much all</font>

1405
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:00,480
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero companies on this and so we're</font>

1406
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not the best example of that I</font>

1407
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,080
will say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though my VP of</font>

1408
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,170
regulatory affairs would not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1409
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,520
about this if our CEO and board and

1410
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,980
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not asking questions</font>

1411
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's just not on her radar it's</font>

1412
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,330
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there so it is being talked</font>

1413
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:18,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that level and for us that's</font>

1414
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:21,870
because of FDA but from across the

1415
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:25,500
industry and this comes back to I think

1416
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:27,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're still in the security researchers</font>

1417
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,270
and technologists talking about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1418
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:32,310
the comms piece that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on</font>

1419
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,950
be it when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take ownership of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1420
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:37,290
ourselves is how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we showing the</font>

1421
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:39,240
business value<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this and not in you</font>

1422
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,070
know return on investments or anything

1423
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,529
else it's we need to keep really simple

1424
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,360
messaging to you know sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1425
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:47,070
that here is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact that this will</font>

1426
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,840
have and like a company like Microsoft

1427
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,310
is probably a great example of that that

1428
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,070
of it is really been ingrained into

1429
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:55,200
company culture and you know you guys

1430
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:56,730
probably have experiences from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 15</font>

1431
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,250
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when you started that process</font>

1432
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:00,960
and how you solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that's</font>

1433
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,570
something that we need to then take over

1434
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,250
and say okay this community thing that

1435
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:09,000
started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NTIA but is now</font>

1436
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,289
evolving into a community-based set of

1437
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,869
resources or working

1438
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:14,819
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on how do you sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

1439
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:17,549
your company how do i as a security

1440
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">person within a large corporation say no</font>

1441
00:57:17,549 --> 00:57:21,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer do I want to try and get involved</font>

1442
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:23,038
in this as just me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want my company to</font>

1443
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:24,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">support this I want my company to send</font>

1444
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings I want them to put</font>

1445
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:28,229
ten fifteen percent of my time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

1446
00:57:26,429 --> 00:57:30,630
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have to sell a business</font>

1447
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:32,578
case first not a technologists case and

1448
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,140
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the messaging that would need to</font>

1449
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:36,689
change the work and stay the same but

1450
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,308
the messaging would have to tweak a

1451
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:42,089
little it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got thrown real quickly</font>

1452
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:45,029
since the car guys not around in the

1453
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:46,288
USDOT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's are there signs of</font>

1454
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:47,819
progress there as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as far</font>

1455
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:49,410
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say as the FDA if I had to</font>

1456
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:51,359
somehow measure them but there's some

1457
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:53,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the the vehicle safety</font>

1458
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,339
regulators are looking into it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

1459
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:58,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's a good sign as well and I will</font>

1460
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,779
also add that you know art has been

1461
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:02,038
doing this for a very long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

1462
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:04,679
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy at the Department of</font>

1463
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commerce on cyber security cert is</font>

1464
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,029
really busy right now and the fact that

1465
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:11,279
they're engaging this I think is for me

1466
00:58:09,029 --> 00:58:12,239
a signal that says that at very least

1467
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,130
they want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't</font>

1468
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:18,179
ruin it but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

1469
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">be something that they can then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take to</font>

1470
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:21,299
the broader community together with

1471
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:23,880
universities like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chamber of</font>

1472
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:27,509
commerce and and we're also talking to

1473
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the auto trade groups who like</font>

1474
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:31,529
to communicate and be able to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1475
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:34,859
one voice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their regulator to say hey</font>

1476
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:37,380
we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward on this so think</font>

1477
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:39,179
about what we're already doing before

1478
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,949
you go and impose something that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1479
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:42,569
quite dangerous because early discussion

1480
00:58:40,949 --> 00:58:45,059
that we saw coming out of the auto

1481
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:46,829
sector you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never anything</font>

1482
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,959
very official but there were some signs

1483
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:50,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said that they were proposing you</font>

1484
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:54,390
know treating security flaws the same

1485
00:58:50,999 --> 00:58:58,198
way you treat some of the existing

1486
00:58:54,390 --> 00:59:00,749
safety flaws which are huge events for a

1487
00:58:58,199 --> 00:59:02,789
company and there they make a company

1488
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:05,629
not want to learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not want</font>

1489
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,630
to affirmative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee engage</font>

1490
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:16,339
so there was discussion about the

1491
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:18,650
disagreement between the industry on

1492
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:21,799
when you report something to the vendor

1493
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,630
or company and then when you disclose it

1494
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:25,640
and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of back and forth</font>

1495
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:28,970
between Google and Microsoft on this

1496
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,769
very matter so Google has that policy of

1497
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:32,749
you have exactly 90 days and then

1498
00:59:30,769 --> 00:59:35,180
Microsoft has the policy of we only

1499
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:36,950
patch on patch Tuesdays do you think

1500
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,828
there should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more give between one or</font>

1501
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:42,319
the other such as Microsoft should be so

1502
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:44,450
specific on patching or Google shouldn't

1503
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,619
be so stringent on 90 days or do you

1504
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,749
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they need to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort</font>

1505
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:54,440
of better middle ground that's policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1506
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:56,328
myself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a fun debate certainly in</font>

1507
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,240
a sense I don't know how he super useful

1508
00:59:56,329 --> 01:00:01,220
it is so so actually so here's because

1509
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,990
actually to take your example I'm pretty

1510
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,578
sure if I remember after that whole

1511
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,109
thing happened who will modify their

1512
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:08,450
policy so they now have an extra to get

1513
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">a two-week kick at the end so that's an</font>

1514
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,609
example of policy we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy you</font>

1515
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:15,549
mutually what it was we disagreed a

1516
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:17,960
premature disclosure happened and then

1517
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:19,480
somebody adjusted their policy so things

1518
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,759
things shifted to work a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

1519
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:24,289
together there are so many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1520
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:26,150
organizations to so many ideas different

1521
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:28,730
business practices different release

1522
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:30,650
cycles we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get agreement</font>

1523
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even going to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you</font>

1524
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,910
know what's the exact number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of days we</font>

1525
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,769
surveyed a little bit and the average

1526
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,660
was ins in the 60 department but that's

1527
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:40,368
that's just what's actually happening

1528
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:43,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not you know it's not being a</font>

1529
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:46,430
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> number um yeah right we write we</font>

1530
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:49,339
write 45 days we almost never almost

1531
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,538
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> do 45 days that's our we couldn't</font>

1532
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:52,670
get back we didn't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the vendor</font>

1533
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:56,890
in 45 so we'll drop 45 on you instead of

1534
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:58,940
0 so it's a fun debate I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1535
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,828
super useful it is to try to figure out

1536
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that embargo period should be I</font>

1537
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're not going to get agreement</font>

1538
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,839
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phoner</font>

1539
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,880
abilities there are too many to have to

1540
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,380
really almost care about individual ones

1541
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,289
it's very fun too don't get me wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1542
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:15,019
love it sort of but<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there are so</font>

1543
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:17,749
many we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to just it needs to be all</font>

1544
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:19,629
this in a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that specific</font>

1545
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:21,879
thing that Tavis was yelling at my

1546
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,610
foul<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this day it was like everybody</font>

1547
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,300
stop and pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that it's a</font>

1548
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:32,290
there's more more scale than that yeah

1549
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:35,740
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just add that I think also that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1550
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:38,560
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the reality is that a</font>

1551
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,970
disclosure is a collaboration and in any

1552
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,020
collaboration there has to be some

1553
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:43,569
give-and-take there has to be

1554
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:46,870
willingness to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> common ground and so</font>

1555
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,880
that works pervert provided that both

1556
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:51,279
sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> are collaborating right so I think</font>

1557
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason that you set a timeline is</font>

1558
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,000
exactly as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the situations</font>

1559
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">where people are not collaborating when</font>

1560
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,570
you're not getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a response and</font>

1561
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:01,420
nothing's happening but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1562
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are getting response if you are finding</font>

1563
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement then the</font>

1564
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:10,210
reality is to hold on to a deadline for

1565
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,339
just like because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> salon deadline is</font>

1566
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:15,820
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it is actually not</font>

1567
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:18,310
putting the users first it's not really

1568
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,570
sort of thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you it's not</font>

1569
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:22,630
really thinking about the risk model in

1570
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:25,960
the big picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets and it also is not</font>

1571
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:27,460
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create the the trust and the</font>

1572
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,260
benefit of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt between the parties</font>

1573
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is going to lead to the best</font>

1574
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible outcome so we like just</font>

1575
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,160
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hours and we work very</font>

1576
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,870
closely with that we push all our

1577
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,970
disclosures<font color="#CCCCCC"> reset we do a lot a</font>

1578
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,680
disclosure either for our own research

1579
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:45,319
or four members<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

1580
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,930
community so our published policy

1581
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:50,420
is we go to the vendor we give them 15

1582
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:52,879
days and then we go to cert and we

1583
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:56,119
follow certs 45 days they get 60 days in

1584
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:59,180
total but what typically happens is if

1585
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:00,920
there is engagement then we talk to Sir

1586
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,598
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the vendor and we agree on a</font>

1587
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,089
time line that makes sense and it's

1588
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:08,029
normally less than 90 days depending on

1589
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:10,279
the sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how complex it is but we</font>

1590
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:11,660
are all agreed that will be flexible

1591
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:13,099
because at the end of the day that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1592
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:18,828
best thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users and that's what</font>

1593
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:20,660
we care about would you say the specific

1594
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:22,489
complication there was just then Google

1595
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,549
and Microsoft not collaborating well

1596
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:30,529
absolutely it was TV companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

1597
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:34,910
to bow to each other sorry I think the

1598
01:03:30,529 --> 01:03:38,569
yeah if you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the framing that</font>

1599
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:40,549
we all care about security<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

1600
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:42,589
have the productive discussion where you

1601
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:44,269
know what about the shadow of the future

1602
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:46,549
will if you say it takes a long time to

1603
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:48,919
fix it now what about the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it</font>

1604
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:50,538
helps unpack why people have the

1605
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,130
policies they do and it lends itself to

1606
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:55,630
compromise as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you started saying</font>

1607
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:59,299
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this is about protecting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1608
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:04,089
can I ask you do differentiate privacy

1609
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:08,380
and security somehow I can refer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1610
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:12,049
the fifth<font color="#CCCCCC"> chapter of my dissertation</font>

1611
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,430
which was called privacy securing the

1612
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:17,229
dynamics of networked information

1613
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:26,808
sharing probably a little dated by now

1614
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:28,368
you the it is a flashbacks of trying to

1615
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:32,059
convince Harvard to laminate Creative

1616
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:34,940
Commons in pagosa so the the challenge

1617
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:36,229
is there a couple of tensions there

1618
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:39,259
which sometimes there really are

1619
01:04:36,229 --> 01:04:41,509
concerns especially because oddly enough

1620
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:44,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">we often have more privacy regulations</font>

1621
01:04:41,509 --> 01:04:46,519
than we have security regulations and so

1622
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:48,559
you might have a vendor in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

1623
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:51,680
were talking to companies initially as

1624
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:54,799
proposed miss uh we had vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font>

1625
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:58,219
I have data and I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to</font>

1626
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:59,240
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me when that data is not secure but</font>

1627
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:01,580
if in the process

1628
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,368
of finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that that data is not</font>

1629
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:08,569
secure they access that data that

1630
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:11,420
triggers a compliance event that could

1631
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:15,770
cost me hundreds of thousands if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1632
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:20,540
millions of dollars and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again if our</font>

1633
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:22,640
goal is to incentivize<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1634
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,860
take security seriously and to work with

1635
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,109
those outside that's where it gets to

1636
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:29,060
what can a researcher know about how

1637
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:30,170
they should engage the best companies

1638
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,970
and that's something that we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1639
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:33,710
work with of bringing the company

1640
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:36,680
perspective in of how do you what why

1641
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:38,960
don't they just engage and why do they

1642
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,490
lawyer up so often<font color="#E5E5E5"> and often it's</font>

1643
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,880
because there are real risks that

1644
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:45,470
they're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1645
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,260
the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've done and the</font>

1646
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:49,549
stakeholder have done is like to say

1647
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:52,580
stand down let's let's get the lawyers

1648
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:54,770
out of this and focus on security you

1649
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:56,210
guys have thoughts on privacy just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1650
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,740
I think if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

1651
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,270
of disclosure then it does change the

1652
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">game a little bit because if there has</font>

1653
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a violation of privacy standards</font>

1654
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:07,670
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's imposes a timeline there are</font>

1655
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,530
state notification requirements and they

1656
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:12,350
have specific timeline some of them and

1657
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:15,410
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a researcher have</font>

1658
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:18,680
accidentally accessed PII or

1659
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:20,118
ph<font color="#CCCCCC"> I then then that does change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

1660
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,589
somewhat in terms of your disclosure and

1661
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:22,910
you need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

1662
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:24,920
the vendor will be aware of what it is

1663
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the chances are if you've done that</font>

1664
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,720
it will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the vendors response</font>

1665
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:31,940
vendors tend to be much more sensitive

1666
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,709
to disclosures when it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1667
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:37,760
trigger an action from them that has

1668
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:40,280
regulatory consequences so that's just

1669
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,720
something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be grateful yeah the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

1670
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,970
why I'm asking because I'm from Europe

1671
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:47,750
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the new EU regulation in</font>

1672
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:53,450
2018 and it's a 72 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> to report it so</font>

1673
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:57,079
it's a quite tough thing yeah the

1674
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:59,058
gentleman<font color="#CCCCCC"> from Fitz ok again i'm going</font>

1675
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do my disclaimer no not my company's</font>

1676
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:03,980
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and so as somebody who</font>

1677
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:05,960
deals with insane amounts of PII I

1678
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,160
actually think that it's one of the

1679
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,829
reasons that this is so important

1680
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,259
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a defined process</font>

1681
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:13,339
that researchers so researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1682
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,609
going to try to try and break into my

1683
01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:18,558
 anyway if we have a process out

1684
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:20,029
there that at least set some boundaries

1685
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guidelines and bright lines</font>

1686
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:25,160
that I can point to and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

1687
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:28,879
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and break into my stuff for</font>

1688
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:31,339
good reasons then look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font>

1689
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,470
can say then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this set of stuff has</font>

1690
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:35,450
PII in it and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break</font>

1691
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:37,160
into it well at least give me a heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1692
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,868
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try so that we can</font>

1693
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,270
meet things like a 72-hour disclosure

1694
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:42,829
deadline because if you're breaking in

1695
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:44,809
and then you send me something and it's

1696
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take me tell me two hours to</font>

1697
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:48,770
evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at them it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too late for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1698
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:51,410
whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we set that expectation for</font>

1699
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:53,720
security researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> upfront</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of</font>

1700
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:57,770
a whole framework then suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes</font>

1701
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:59,839
my life on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pii side a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier so</font>

1702
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:01,940
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the two are in competition</font>

1703
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:04,160
but particularly for those of us who

1705
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,690
actually intrinsically linked

1706
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:14,259
practices for vendors but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also</font>

1707
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:16,660
best practices for researchers and we as

1708
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:19,300
a community are allergic to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea we</font>

1709
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,889
hate the idea of conformity of some kind

1710
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,960
particularly the idea that that could

1711
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:25,000
come from vendors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like the</font>

1712
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,310
worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible thing I mean God were not</font>

1713
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,050
generally what's going on and like

1714
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:31,870
that's kind of a crazy thing for us

1715
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:33,550
today and so you know actually sending a

1716
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,380
baseline of like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

1717
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:38,380
talking yesterday in the cfa session

1718
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we and i made a comment that ended</font>

1719
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,690
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> being like more contentious than my</font>

1720
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:44,740

01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:50,620
you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> off me with the case you can</font>

1723
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:53,889
google it but he well it shouldn't set

1724
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:55,930
case law that what he did is a violation

1725
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:58,690
of the survey at the same time the

1726
01:08:55,930 --> 01:09:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times that he access or not</font>

him but his buddy accessed the if the

1728
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:07,720
creds they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they collected that</font>

1729
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:10,750
is not a proof of concept a proof of

1730
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,160
concept is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 times you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1731
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a hundred thousand times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1732
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred thousand times and so I think</font>

1733
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:18,640
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely fine for a vendor to say</font>

1734
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:20,290
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what like we're going to</font>

1735
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it so that you have to do this on a</font>

1736
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,170
minimal level if you do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

1737
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,950
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as friendly as I</font>

1738
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:29,050
would be four colleagues in Europe the

1739
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:31,660
Dutch have been incredibly

1740
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:33,250
forward-leaning and thinking in they

1741
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">still use the term responsible</font>

1742
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:36,700
disclosure which might be unfortunate i

1743
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:40,510
don't think we're going to lose that

1744
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:41,679
term on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the European side but on the</font>

1745
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,770
other hand what they've done has

1746
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:46,440
actually they have national policy all

1747
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:50,970
the way down to prosecutorial discretion

1748
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:53,439
saying if a researcher you know has

1749
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:56,110
engages in this behavior avoids these

1750
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:58,210
things that that are clearly bad and is

1751
01:09:56,110 --> 01:10:00,099
doing it with good intent then

1752
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:01,810
prosecutors have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand down and I</font>

1753
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's very powerful yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'd</font>

1754
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:08,410
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just to throw in here a bit the</font>

01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">site I also believe there are you know</font>

1756
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:15,010
they're responsible ethical researcher

1757
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,719
guidelines I mean they're they're things

1758
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:20,590
researchers you know

1759
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:23,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote should follow more I think</font>

1760
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:25,210
than just being told to conform and I

1761
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:28,058
sorry I'm speaking to the choir up here

1762
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:30,179
but if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were such a guideline</font>

1763
01:10:28,059 --> 01:10:32,619
written down somewhere and published

1764
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:34,239
that can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> against a researcher to</font>

1765
01:10:32,619 --> 01:10:38,049
say you fell outside of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guidelines</font>

1766
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,058
guess what the safe harbors out here

1767
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:43,630
comes every every law we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw at</font>

1768
01:10:40,059 --> 01:10:45,639
you so the concern is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how how</font>

1769
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:48,429
how bright those lines are and if that's

1770
01:10:45,639 --> 01:10:50,710
out there you're your it can be flipped

1771
01:10:48,429 --> 01:10:52,960
around on basically system policy judo

1772
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:55,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus researchers as it gets done right</font>

1773
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,690
yeah nonetheless we advocate for like

1774
01:10:55,719 --> 01:11:00,909
yeah first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pii you got</font>

1775
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:03,339
it stop right and tell someone that

1776
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:05,170
indicates your intent of not downloading

1777
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:11,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">a thousand people stuff just the one</font>

1778
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:19,190
compact other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions comments</font>

1779
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:22,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback what do we do yes</font>

1780
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:24,769
non vertical space I could say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1781
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:27,760
FTC<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a few cases that have said that</font>

1782
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:29,900
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fail to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate</font>

1783
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,469
vulnerability disclosure processes

1784
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:37,670
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall in the realm of unfairness</font>

1785
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:42,230
counts again on FTC act so the recent

1786
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:44,870
azuz little clutter<font color="#CCCCCC"> good ok so the</font>

1787
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:46,160
recent like a Zeus case was the router

1788
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,739
security case and part of that

1789
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,090
unfairness count included their failure

1790
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:53,139
to have an adequate vulnerability

1791
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:55,640
disclosure process so outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1792
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:59,300
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of regulated verticals I think the</font>

1793
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:01,400
FTC is trying to kind of make statements

1794
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,900
about vulnerability disclosure yeah I

1795
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,400
completely agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i think that</font>

1796
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:09,830
the FTC's like sort of enforcement

1797
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,500
capabilities will will will over time

1798
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:14,390
drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shift in culture it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1799
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take a long time whereas I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

1800
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:18,380
vertical sector regulatory authorities

1801
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:24,730
will have more direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> short-term impact</font>

1802
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:24,730
for those specific verticals sorry but

1803
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,009
right exactly and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1804
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,989
problem is awareness that's the

1805
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:32,610
challenge is like there isn't all good

1806
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:36,570
enough awareness you get the letter from

1807
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:38,880
them you become aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

1808
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:42,239
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this so I don't see the time</font>

1809
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:44,280
I mean that is he got very least it's a

1810
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,500
bit it's at least shows that there's a

1811
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,440
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> base line for sure I mean I'm</font>

1812
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:51,270
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 you might you might get some</font>

1813
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,400
traction out of the example right so

1814
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,770
every other crappy router vendor with no

1815
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,469
security now it looks hey ASA scalded up

1816
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:59,910
for this yeah maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should take the</font>

1817
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:02,610
steps before we also get lit up because

1818
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:09,330
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> just poor job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as needed yeah I</font>

1819
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean I hope so for sure yessir other</font>

1820
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:16,199
suggestions how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> save the world</font>

1821
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:18,870
safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> chilly no such an old reference</font>

1822
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:20,519
that was surprisingly dated it didn't

1823
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:23,960
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the liner always</font>

1824
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,960
little dated references

1825
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:40,339
if you'd left it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> artists life may</font>

1826
01:13:30,769 --> 01:13:42,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">be much more talkative so who's here oh</font>

1827
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:44,389
good no I don't actually particularly

1828
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:47,058
have a question I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get Jen to</font>

1829
01:13:44,389 --> 01:13:49,669
expand a little bit more on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1830
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:53,030
it does Archer obviously that goes

1831
01:13:49,669 --> 01:13:56,539
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying but the the sort of</font>

1832
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:58,909
change that the researchers side needs

1833
01:13:56,539 --> 01:14:01,780
to be cognizant of because when you're

1834
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:05,568
talking about automobiles and

1835
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:08,719
installations in oil refineries those

1836
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:12,169
are not things that fit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-and-fast</font>

1837
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:14,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">90-day completely great and even once</font>

1838
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:16,760
you've gotten past the disclosure you

1839
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:18,648
look at cart I mean I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a car today</font>

1840
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,659
that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not had its airbag replaced or</font>

1841
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:23,599
does not have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modern safety</font>

1842
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:27,409
stuff so from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher side we're</font>

1843
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:29,329
in a totally new yeah area where we can

1844
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:31,728
inadvertently put people at risk yeah

1845
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:33,558
while following all the ethical rules I

1846
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:34,909
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I think it's the Wild West</font>

1847
01:14:33,559 --> 01:14:37,159
all over again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think what's</font>

1848
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:41,869
interesting is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've entered a sort</font>

1849
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:45,530
of new point in the culture of the

1850
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:48,139
community I kind of think of it as like

1851
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:49,699
sort of the security community<font color="#CCCCCC"> tudo</font>

1852
01:14:48,139 --> 01:14:51,379
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is terrible but it's almost like</font>

1853
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:53,388
you know we had our generation alpha and

1854
01:14:51,379 --> 01:14:57,289
now we're in a in the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of next</font>

1855
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:58,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">generation and we've we've evolved or</font>

1856
01:14:57,289 --> 01:15:00,619
we've matured out from being from

1857
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:01,969
skinnies who were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious and</font>

1858
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:05,148
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how it worked and test</font>

1859
01:15:01,969 --> 01:15:06,649
limits suddenly being like people who

1860
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:08,389
are buying cars and putting our kids in

1861
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:09,949
them and going holy like there's

1862
01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:12,260
actual implications with this stuff and

1863
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:14,178
so I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

1864
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:16,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">researchers I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to feel the weight</font>

1865
01:15:14,179 --> 01:15:17,929
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually you know going</font>

1866
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:20,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to that fifteen percent caring</font>

1867
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:21,379
about the money a lot of the researchers

1868
01:15:20,419 --> 01:15:22,790
I talk to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing this because</font>

1869
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they want to save the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world like</font>

1870
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it comes down to that you really</font>

1871
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:31,910
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact to consumers yes</font>

1872
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:35,780
and so Krieger is not a good good

1873
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:39,650
example of this not one sec um and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1874
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:41,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you know that is</font>

1875
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:43,009
difficult like we are sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making up</font>

1876
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:45,200
as we go as Josh said like we have to

1877
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,420
find the new paradigms of what that

1878
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,470
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though rapid7 that's</font>

1879
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,090
the process we're going through right

1880
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:52,250
now is as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this disclosure</font>

1881
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:53,930
policy it's been a disclosure policy for

1882
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,330
the five years I've work to the company

1883
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:58,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we are internally looking</font>

1884
01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:01,820
about going we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to now have a</font>

1885
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">category of this is this except when it</font>

1886
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,480
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things that affect human life</font>

1887
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:07,580
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's going to be like what does</font>

1888
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:10,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">that look like how do we set time lines</font>

1889
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,870
when you're dealing with cars right it's

1890
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,700
a totally different<font color="#E5E5E5"> paradigm we have no</font>

1891
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:16,370
clue what that looks like but I think

1892
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:18,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only way to get there is to work</font>

1893
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:20,000
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I say work together I</font>

1894
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,460
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mean within the research</font>

1895
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,530
community although<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for sure but we</font>

1896
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:26,990
have to work with water makers we have

1897
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,240
to get to understand what their process

1898
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,590
is we know what software development

1899
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,690
looks like a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have worked in</font>

1900
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:37,760
software development we don't know what

1901
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:39,500
automaking looks like no clue so Anna

1902
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,470
like insane to medical devices you know

1903
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,930
we need to understand what that involves

1904
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:46,310
and the only way to do that is to work

1905
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:47,840
with them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have empathy for what</font>

1906
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:50,390
they're going through and if you

1907
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,510
approach that as you know you're the bad

1908
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys mind a good guy</font>

1909
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:54,769
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve anything I set</font>

1910
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:56,669
that the right way around right yeah

1911
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:59,340
sometimes i'm gonna sell high taking

1912
01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:01,320
said they were yeah so we like we really

1913
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:03,889
need to find that common ground I think

1914
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,889
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step</font>

1915
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:17,670
do I get an award for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so one thing</font>

1916
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:20,230
that that art did not mention that that

1917
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,329
some of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart people in his</font>

1918
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:26,110
group have been thinking about is there

1919
01:17:22,329 --> 01:17:28,900
will be instances when you will disagree

1920
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:31,900
on how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> handle things and that doesn't</font>

1921
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that still doesn't mean that it go back</font>

1922
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:36,098
goes back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wild West and we should</font>

1923
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,659
have anarchy there still are some things

1924
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:40,210
that we can do to still have good

1925
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:41,499
practice in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case or do can I put</font>

1926
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:47,949
you on the spot to share some of the

1927
01:17:41,499 --> 01:17:49,989
thoughts that you guys have had so this

1928
01:17:47,949 --> 01:17:50,949
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is disagree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agree to</font>

1929
01:17:49,989 --> 01:17:59,110
disagree how do you make that

1930
01:17:50,949 --> 01:18:01,360
constructive well you may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it</font>

1931
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:03,820
it may come down to not agree and me

1932
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:05,619
simply not agreeing so the Google

1933
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:09,400
Microsoft example Google Google win

1934
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:11,170
right that happens sometimes one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1935
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:15,848
parties involves pulled to the ground

1936
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:17,530
business tired of waiting values it puts

1937
01:18:15,849 --> 01:18:19,389
different value on the impact of the

1938
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,789
vulnerability or the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety impact</font>

1939
01:18:19,389 --> 01:18:23,829
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world over it might be you know</font>

1940
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:25,210
chances of it being<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually attacked in</font>

01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:30,699
successful time to deploy fixes our

1943
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:32,440
attacker is going to bother with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

1944
01:18:30,699 --> 01:18:35,138
complicated attack when phishing emails

1945
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,360
are still working what kind of attack

1946
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:39,309
are you looking at broad opportunistic

1947
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:41,530
attackers or a nation-state targeted

1948
01:18:39,309 --> 01:18:44,170
attacks people have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinions</font>

1949
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:45,610
all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that can come down</font>

1950
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:47,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to how bad is that they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1951
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:51,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">is which causes them to say it's fine to</font>

1952
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:54,549
deflate<font color="#E5E5E5"> disclose now or in less weight</font>

1953
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:56,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it to some extent the dumb answer is</font>

1954
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:57,940
you have to accept you're going to lose

1955
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:00,519
out sometimes your opinions not going to

1956
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:03,579
carry the day and be able to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1957
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:04,869
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's it's it's largely if</font>

1958
01:19:03,579 --> 01:19:07,150
you have the information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:11,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to publish it at least in</font>

1962
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:18,260
you but you know publishing details of a

1963
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:20,720
bug is free speech in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. attacking</font>

1964
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:25,070
someone with it is not is typically

1965
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:26,180
illegal so I don't know what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1966
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,799
really except I mean it's certain i'm

1967
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:30,740
trying to think of our cases we accept

1968
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we will ask people will ask nicely</font>

1969
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:35,620
and repeatedly and make good arguments

1970
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:38,240
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things delay or extend or</font>

1971
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,610
hurry<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and publish or ebony to fix out</font>

1972
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,510
and we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not surprised people you</font>

1977
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:51,590
that's going to be our date so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

it for us and try to achieve consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

the trying to negotiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font>

1985
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:06,880
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about yeah</font>

1986
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:19,110
along the lines of how to speed adoption

1987
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,790
or make it more companies adopt

1988
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,980
especially those companies outside of

1989
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:27,420
the technology industry you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1990
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:29,669
actually take a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take one</font>

1991
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,159
of those companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have them look at</font>

1992
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:34,560
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is terrifying to them they've</font>

01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">been making you know widgets for all of</font>

01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:48,449
everywhere and actually making them

1998
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:51,540
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security research</font>

1999

2000
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:56,369
and obviously as your survey shows we're

2001
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:58,080
really not coming to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them we're</font>

2002
01:20:56,369 --> 01:21:01,170
really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a better a better</font>

world they're seen the guy hacking an

2004

them understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this this room this</font>

2009
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:22,530
is actually who's out there trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

2010

<font color="#CCCCCC">help them not her to thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you any media</font>

2011
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:27,389
story with the picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the scary</font>

2012
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:29,250
looking you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gone past</font>

2013
01:21:27,389 --> 01:21:30,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">well yes i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw a mask recently</font>

2014
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:33,270
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean how many people like</font>

2015
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:34,739
worrying about a claw<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always do I and</font>

2016
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:40,110
she can't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keyboard properly</font>

2017
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:42,030
without one yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this fear</font>

2018
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,308
on both sides and the problem is fear

2019
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:48,919
makes people behave in

2020
01:21:44,309 --> 01:21:48,919
irrational and defensive and overlays

2021
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:58,739
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and MP just come here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X down I</font>

2022
01:21:54,260 --> 01:22:03,719
agree so who thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we said</font>

2023
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:05,848
today was fairly common sense so that's

2024
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sororities</font>

2025
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:14,059
I think that it means that this is not a

2026
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:16,469
contentious issue who is worked with a

2027
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:19,800
vendor before to to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> say hey I</font>

2028
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:23,059
found something got a couple hands has

2029
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:26,099
anyone been on the receiving side

2030
01:22:23,059 --> 01:22:27,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">mooreville I won't put anyone on the</font>

2031
01:22:26,099 --> 01:22:28,530
spot but is there anyone who's been on

2032
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:30,629
the receiving side who wants to share

2033
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:40,978
some experiences or react to what we

2034
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:45,629
said today yes and it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> without a</font>

2035
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:48,539
process at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplest level because</font>

2036
01:22:45,629 --> 01:22:51,510
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there that want to</font>

2037
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:53,369
do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are so many</font>

2038
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:55,709
industries not just my own but others as

2039
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:57,209
well that if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a process there</font>

2040
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:59,760
when you get a revealer ability and

2041
01:22:57,209 --> 01:23:01,589
reporting to your customer service<font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

2042
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,349
address or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something and you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

2043
01:23:01,589 --> 01:23:06,449
idea what to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at the company</font>

2044
01:23:04,349 --> 01:23:07,919
has no idea what to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked</font>

2045
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:10,499
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company in number of years ago</font>

2046
01:23:07,919 --> 01:23:13,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I got an email about it because in</font>

2047
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:14,639
my internal company profile thing I had

2048
01:23:13,139 --> 01:23:17,280
interested in vulnerability disclosure

2049
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,679
on and somebody had literally googled on

2050
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:22,648
<font color="#E5E5E5">her internal portal and it came to me so</font>

2051
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,550
that's where so many companies are so

2052
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:28,859
without the work that you guys are doing

2053
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:30,689
it's hard and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it easier</font>

2054
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:34,169
because then it becomes easier for

2055
01:23:30,689 --> 01:23:36,520
everybody like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are super busy</font>

2056
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:38,139
they have processes of how they

2057
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,910
to do things like generally people are

2058
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,440
not bad people they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they have</font>

2059
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:43,720
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been told these your</font>

2060
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:46,629
priorities these your goals and your

2061
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:49,270
happily working away as an engineer and

2062
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:51,100
you've won<font color="#CCCCCC"> a delivery deadline and you</font>

2063
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:53,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that delivery deadline</font>

2064
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,420
slips then that has a high impact for

2065
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:57,550
the business and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem and as</font>

2066
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:00,580
going back for the customer as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and</font>

2067
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:02,260
so when somebody comes to you and says

2068
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:04,210
hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blow up your schedule</font>

2069
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:05,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to divert you on to this</font>

2070
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,260
other task on this thing that you

2071
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:09,790
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were dealt with ages ago and</font>

2072
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:12,370
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to completely impact all your</font>

2073
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:15,220
other work like that's frustrating ab

2074
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,510
fast and at worst it's like it it makes

2075
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,330
people in secure it makes an anxious

2076
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:21,100
it's difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are no like people</font>

2077
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,720
doing the stuff or typically there are

2078
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,760
not a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the stuff who</font>

2079
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:26,350
would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mare about it I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when the</font>

2080
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,570
same like we get vulnerabilities

2081
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:30,100
flourishes and you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

2082
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:32,380
when I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a conversation with</font>

2083
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:35,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">pizza fly geyser I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay you've</font>

done the patch have we put it out yet

2085
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:40,440
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like oh we have a</font>

2088
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:46,780

2089
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:49,120
don't care they do it's just that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

2090
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:50,769

2091
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,900
the process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go through we always</font>

2092
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:54,940
do a release on a specific date

2093
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:58,150
microsoft has<font color="#CCCCCC"> tuesday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's the same</font>

2094
01:24:54,940 --> 01:25:00,009
mentality and so you you just that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

2095
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:01,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think and people don't like change</font>

2096
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:02,920
very much so when you're like hey we're

2097
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,019
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this completely different</font>

2098
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,039
thing that you've not done

2099
01:25:04,019 --> 01:25:09,249
they kind of sit there scratching their

2100
01:25:06,039 --> 01:25:11,860
heads so for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who would like</font>

01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:31,449
eff in the Department of Commerce I said

2110
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:40,090
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some solutions that work</font>

2111
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:42,099
well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all involved and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

our assistant secretary just announced

01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:03,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so the challenge is there's all</font>

sorts of smart consumer stuff out there

2120
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:09,309
and not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is built for security</font>

2121
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:11,110
so how do we promote consumer awareness

2122
01:26:09,309 --> 01:26:13,420
of security and how to reward

2123
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:14,440
manufacturer attention to security we're

2124
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:16,389
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting with aftermarket</font>

2125
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:18,249
security taking a page from our

2126
01:26:16,389 --> 01:26:21,699
colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the FDA and saying listen</font>

2127
01:26:18,249 --> 01:26:23,199
patch ability is important but there's

2128
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:25,719
no real understanding of what it means

2129
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:27,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">for something to be patchable so let's</font>

2130
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:30,670
have a discussion around the technical

2131
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:32,919
definitions of patch ability and then

2132
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:34,300
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a way to condense that into a</font>

2133
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,409
way that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be easily communicated</font>

2134
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,960
to the consumer the consumer is

2135
01:26:35,409 --> 01:26:39,789
something quickly to look for here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

2136
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,099
some small words that I can understand

2137
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:45,820
and look for in a package but they are

2138
01:26:42,099 --> 01:26:47,590
supported by a well-defined technical

2139
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:50,320
description that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to build</font>

2140
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:52,150
standards or built to spec on so trying

2141
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,340
to derive it from the demand side and

2142
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:56,110
the supply<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and if you're interested</font>

2143
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:59,409
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm very happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk further</font>
