63
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,150
still is like I'm hearing but we'll get

64
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,819
it there so what should you consider is

65
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">your kicking off the program so this</font>

66
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,630
impacting factor so Pam sized

67
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,250
organization you're having that thing so

68
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,769
personnel change so people are going to

69
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,470
come and go you have ten to twenty four

70
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,780
seven support step you have company you

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,400
run explosive growth to be a big thing

72
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,440
that's a that's definitely a huge

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,760
challenges how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you as you're going</font>

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,829
down the road trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,920
also change tires we're going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">road resistance to change this change is</font>

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,670
hard you know he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out for</font>

78
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">free but sometimes it feels like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

79
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,599
you know people people are used to doing

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,610
things a certain way why can't I do it

81
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,268
this way those kind of things like how

82
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,470
do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to overcome those challenges</font>

83
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,510
ability to execute that's another big

84
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,790
piece tubes that you know one of the

85
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,649
things is<font color="#E5E5E5"> see nobody has a limited</font>

86
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,629
budget really has a limited time so you

87
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,670
have to stay focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's the most</font>

88
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,340
important part and understanding some

89
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,518
things you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to improve</font>

90
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,310
later on and then external so you have

91
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,810
changing statutory regulations

92
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,900
increasing customer requirements and

93
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,310
let's face it I don't how you guys feel

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,289
but I get these things from customers

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,940
all time why aren't you knew requires

96
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,798
you have sought to why don't you have

97
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,050
this why don't you got back is beyond

98
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,340
any help all year long is better we did

99
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,979
was you know pick a nursing

100
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,039
certification it was and then we also

101
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,690
new vulnerabilities you know the IT guys

102
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,099
have the easier sometimes because it

103
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,930
Stacy they have a new web version

104
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,240
windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> in few years we have your</font>

105
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,710
vulnerability every day so who here has

106
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,949
ever felt that<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone in their company</font>

107
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:49,940
might feel like this yeah so that's one

108
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things one of my favorite</font>

109
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,229
frameworks as I so because<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced</font>

110
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,880
continuous improvement that's one of the

111
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">best things that I say you're compliant</font>

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,389
but you still have continued<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve</font>

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't get to just stick with</font>

114
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:06,260
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> past it just say if we are so where</font>

115
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,389
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start right so the first thing is to</font>

116
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,810
start with people so who are the people

117
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,669
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on your core team but also who</font>

118
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,260
are the different different business

119
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,789
units of stakeholders who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

120
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">be working with implement this it's not</font>

121
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to be you you're going to</font>

122
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,370
have people from IT depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

123
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,930
sofa might be professional services

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,400
the people who hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSSP will handle the</font>

125
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,780
customer data and things like that i'm

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,159
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be having to deal with</font>

127
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">different stakeholders so figure out who</font>

128
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,449
they are finding those people that can

129
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach the security gospel and those that</font>

130
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,720
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big pain in your ass</font>

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,310
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are and start</font>

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,000
working around working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them and</font>

133
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,410
then process right so first one of the

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,330
most important things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

135
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,910
what your processes are so instead of

136
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,270
writing these beautiful you know 50 page

137
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:56,210
SOPs of a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> of healing compulsive</font>

138
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,430
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you actually do you guys</font>

139
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,138
start there you just make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

140
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,330
everybody including what they say they

141
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,280
actually do it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great start</font>

142
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,109
and great directors at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,179
can't start wrapping technology around

144
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:15,830
it to either enforce that process or

145
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,900
control it different links and then

146
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,020
let's talk about one of the pieces of

147
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,109
server processes to so 10 mistakes item

148
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,870
is that I have done I'll start rolling

149
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,580
on HR security<font color="#E5E5E5"> SOP before I even have</font>

150
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the core processes any have in</font>

151
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,900
place first so what are those four

152
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,400
processes need have you know your

153
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,530
committee procedures are you going to me

154
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,169
how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about your document control</font>

your audit is looking your training<font color="#CCCCCC"> sot</font>

157
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,190
some of those core SOPs and corrective

158
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,590
action preventive actions if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were a</font>

159
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,539
lot the other recipes how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going</font>

160
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,729
to want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working how</font>

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,680
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to handle it if it breaks</font>

162
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,780
you need to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font>

163
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,280
infrastructure set up first before you

164
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,359
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out the big network</font>

165
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,770
operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice-o-pede things like that</font>

166
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those things in place</font>

167
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,260
first and very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to deal with</font>

168
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">those</font>

169
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:20,909
mature<font color="#CCCCCC"> and crew so scope known to find</font>

170
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">your scope and don't overcomplicate so</font>

171
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,340
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your most pair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of glasses what</font>

172
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,260
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things that drive revving</font>

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,060
that's probably in your scope or maybe

174
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,469
it's icy<font color="#CCCCCC"> operations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that touches</font>

175
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,670
everybody but they don't necessarily

176
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,770
have to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as much but taking</font>

177
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,330
your scope and understand you know what

178
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,659
is the most important to you so where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

179
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,280
work is our customer data today I feel

180
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,620
really bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> compilatie it got leaked out</font>

181
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,380
but that's not gonna stop revenue all

182
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,990
employees to apologize do so you know

183
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:58,070
figure out what the real scope should be

184
00:07:50,990 --> 00:08:00,450
and then those boundaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this</font>

185
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,610
to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean keep it enforceable</font>

186
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">turn wandering around right what are</font>

187
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,840
those boundaries what is the scope so so

188
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,580
should you have a pc audio CD

189
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,080
environment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what are those</font>

190
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,820
actual boundaries of your perimeter for

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,109
FedRAMP same kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

192
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,510
really understand what those boundaries

193
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,730
are understand how that data flows in

194
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:22,890
and out so mature<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so one of</font>

195
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,590
the things to think about is that when

196
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,530
you start off this can take a I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

197
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,919
your organization take a year to you

198
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,929
expand how big you are right but once

199
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,180
you get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage state where you</font>

200
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,770
actually have you know at least they

201
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,809
might be manual processes would you have

202
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,150
those in place you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to start</font>

203
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,000
really quickly accelerating getting that

204
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">quantity managed fine that's where</font>

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,790
automation comes into play all these

206
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,460
awesome tools they still out there

207
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's great stuff but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

208
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,670
to process what do you want me figure

209
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,960
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> army first what does that</font>

210
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:04,410
process how does this supposed to look

211
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:08,410
what are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna control so maturing</font>

212
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:11,860
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> space how do we go</font>

213
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,959
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of Regular Army</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soldiers to</font>

214
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:21,339
the Marine Corps drills here all right

215
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:23,619
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I click pop right it's pretty sexy or</font>

216
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

217
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:33,490
posture out when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started right</font>

218
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:34,959
all right lessons learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody there</font>

219
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,920
were certain military decision lessons

220
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:44,369
you learn a gash in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty quick all</font>

221
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,959
right so compliance fails so you know

222
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,189
organizations stopping with policies

223
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">drafting one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things you have to</font>

224
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:53,649
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that your procedures are</font>

225
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,449
going to change even if you wrote the

226
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,120
most perfect procedure in the world if

227
00:09:55,449 --> 00:10:00,040
your organization grows at ten percent a

228
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,899
year it's probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

229
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,689
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least ten percent just to keep</font>

230
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,610
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so understanding that you</font>

231
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:08,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do that so you know one thing I</font>

232
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,800
recommend is getting a good piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of s</font>

233
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,689
with the software I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> used the policy</font>

234
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,810
type in the past something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all</font>

235
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:18,730
sell it at that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plug it</font>

236
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,849
just think works is it lets you make

237
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,769
sure you can you can control your push

238
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,470
I'd recipes make sure you can get people

239
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read them when they change and one of</font>

240
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,000
the things I've seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last place says</font>

241
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,060
that they were tracking SOP approvals

242
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,839
via email try it firmly have to an

243
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,319
auditor like that's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> suck so</font>

244
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,650
think about those things

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,680
so you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in place if you can</font>

246
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,840
just this period technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement</font>

247
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">its not protected it hits with a ninny</font>

248
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:55,760
ender<font color="#CCCCCC"> golden this for you what no</font>

249
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:59,329
wine for configurations you know

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,860
policies for the signal policies when I

251
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,490
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assure will they had an</font>

252
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,160
eight-page password policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

253
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">horrible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I got NE mari this is what we</font>

254
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,990
do right so cut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to two paragraphs</font>

255
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,750
good and acceptable use moved it hang on

256
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,090
right keep it as simple as you can so

257
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:22,630
one of the things when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started they</font>

258
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:25,460
had a 50-50 policies 3s apiece okay so

259
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,200
then these policies that their works car

260
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,470
should be frank<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,020
basketball is very impressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at the</font>

262
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,910
end of day what good is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right you</font>

263
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,560
don't know how to follow it so those

264
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,990
policies beyond make sure that you want

265
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,969
to so PC puncture to know how they

266
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,230
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can follow the policy or the</font>

267
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,210
procedure you're actually trying to

268
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,830
force that control now a lot of most

269
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,950
people will try to follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the procedure</font>

270
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,470
if it's clear but if it doesn't say go

271
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,940
here send a meeting on to this distro

272
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,400
you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you make sure you're</font>

273
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,970
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your procedures</font>

274
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,770
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> polycythemia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that</font>

275
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,240
policies don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make any sense you know</font>

276
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,960
one of the things I've struggled with is

277
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">a rules like no BYOD yet you can bring</font>

278
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,670
your phone but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't bring a tab</font>

279
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,980
right think about it though right your

280
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">tablets the same basic alas right so</font>

281
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,530
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point right so lets you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

282
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,620
the challenges I have and having to talk

283
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,610
afterwards about

284
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,040
how you guys tackle those<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones as well</font>

285
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:30,270
so compliance wins yeah it can actually

286
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,520
not sup totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so baseline</font>

287
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,860

business processes are critical to that

330
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,050
server and so when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting out</font>

331

CFO it's a whole lot easier say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

right you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show like your get</font>

445
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,910
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> a-game on take the fight to the</font>

446
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,710
enemy so what I do is I literally a

447
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,090
month before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and about the weekend</font>

448
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">before i go through every single control</font>

449
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,830
and walk through<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I'm going to prove</font>

450
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,020
all those and where that is so when I'm

451
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,470
sit before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auditor I'm taking them</font>

452
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:16,220
to it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this way at a minimum I might</font>

453
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,059
wind up with a pig a minor making

454
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,539
information

455
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:23,240
as opposed bang cooks bands play little

456
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,470
bad ads now is if you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be perfect</font>

457
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,879
but at least you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> show them that you</font>

458
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,429
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to follow the process but</font>

459
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:30,980
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you can prove it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

460
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:34,549
the outer smell blood that are sharps so

461
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,059
if you sit there and you're like it's

462
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:39,769
all quiet I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you a question</font>

463
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,168
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look so well so take the fight</font>

464
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,830
to them right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they're only there for</font>

465
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,620
so long you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm fine and GRC</font>

466
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,990
process and suck it's totally you know

467
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,449
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that if your</font>

468
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:58,549
handles those corrective actions as

469
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,960
preventive actions things like that so

470
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,158
one of the challenges I think we all

471
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time to time it is trying to</font>

472
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,499
understand what the control actually

473
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:12,499
means you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security standpoint well</font>

474
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:14,990
I gotta have this definitely sit anybody

475
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:17,509
hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> bud you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font>

476

<font color="#CCCCCC">da rest encryption reach have to make</font>

477
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:23,509
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is detected yeah so there's</font>

478
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:26,179
things to think about all right risk

479
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:28,279
assessment hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

480
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,899
processes and refinance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> engels to</font>

481
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,700
ask yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial</font>

482
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:33,979
implications legal implications of these

483
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes failing and assess the value</font>

484
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,940
data so look at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an information</font>

485
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:41,899
assets standpoint more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> than from a</font>

486
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:45,340
server or a USB stick right and that's

487
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:45,340
it any questions

488
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,260
how you don't good what<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience do</font>

489
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,520
you have with the risk management

490
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,660
framework for federal information

491
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,910
systems so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this yet</font>

492
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST end of gist so it's basically</font>

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,370
planting<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeff backus if you sorry yeah</font>

494
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,740
so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very question I could</font>

495
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:19,809
definitely follow further off offline

496
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the federal risk risk management</font>

497
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,470
framework is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much different</font>

498
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,950
than the old iso risk management for any

499
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:30,090
more or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 31,000 serious is plan do check</font>

500
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,860
act this it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different but</font>

501
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:40,149
it's all basically the same you know

502
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:42,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a cesta you make your sorry what is</font>

503
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,080
your oyster on mitigated risk and once

504
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,970
you're good at risk being able to

505
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,710
quantitatively prove that one of the big

506
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,390
pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you ask</font>

507
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,429
yourself with people questions as

508
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,160
opposed to following you myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

509
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">points for because I've got proof point</font>

510
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,590
right or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't count</font>

511
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,910
it's great but that's not assist you

512
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,889
wanna make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have good questions</font>

513
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:07,150
on the side as well oh I guess what I'm

514
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,690
asking is because I looked at that

515
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared to the certain set of the ISO</font>

516
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,380
controlled burns there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't much</font>

517
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,590
controls and it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's like</font>

518
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,330
a ton more of controls I'm like why

519
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,750
is there so many oh you're talking about

520
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,980
the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss the 300 controls there</font>

521
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:29,410
yeah i mean that's that's a lot a lot

522
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely it's more grain and it's a</font>

523
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more specific and it's definitely</font>

524
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:39,250
less you know I so says you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

525
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,650
the control but it doesn't necessarily

526
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:45,910
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're gives you guidance whereas</font>
