00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,609
hello thank you besides for having me<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,810
really appreciate it this is a no I

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the better security</font>

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,190
events spoken at bsides Las Vegas San

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,330
Francisco Vancouver Portland DC as well

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,630
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year actually presented at Def Con</font>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,509
which was pretty scary actually so you

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,519
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a little friendlier hopefully</font>

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,140
don't throw anything please so today I'm

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,848
gonna be talking about data science or

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">pseudoscience applauding data science</font>

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,740
concepts to infosec without a PhD that's

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,910
my Twitter handle my email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you</font>

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,230
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have questions and you don't</font>

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,540
want everyone to hear it you know feel

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,980
free to email me I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,230
disclaimer here I am NOT a data

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,059
scientist yeah it's a but I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,529
had the opportunity to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with data</font>

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,419
scientists I actually went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,449
hackathon with the company I work for

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,149
which I will say where I work but they

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,610
went to a hackathon with two PhDs one

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,020
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> from MIT one was from Purdue I have</font>

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,879
a lot of respect for them and what

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,140
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing I think one of the</font>

27
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,780
challenges has been though<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,670
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of the data</font>

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,650
scientists I don't know is anyone

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to a data scientist yeah</font>

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,159
it's kind of difficult sometimes to get

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">a straight answer from them when you're</font>

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually having a discussion and I think</font>

34
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,619
that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges is we're</font>

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,259
sort of we need to you know yes no type

36
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,549
of answers and it's very difficult at a

37
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,009
concrete answer sometimes from a data

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,270
scientist it's also very difficult to

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,430
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those concepts and</font>

40
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,229
how they actually apply to infosec and

41
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,450
so I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig in deeper and</font>

42
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to identify how we can leverage data</font>

43
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,970
science and try to explain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in more</font>

44
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,829
simpler terms so just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about</font>

defensive and offensive security I

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,509
actually presented it Def Con last year

50
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,670
where I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about being a</font>

51
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,100
professional cyber stalker where I

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,170
actually put a lot of bad guys in jail

53
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,449
using data so i was really interested in

54
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,640
collecting information data mining open

55
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,320
source intelligence in particular i'm

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,229
currently focused on security analytics

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hate tomatoes and math so a little</font>

58
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,560
bit

59
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,720
me at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Def Con</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I presented about you know</font>

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,270
how i can actually mine information and

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,980
track criminals so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been really</font>

62
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,560
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in data for for quite a bit a</font>

63
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,299
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it comes to an</font>

64
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,380
information security particularly when

65
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,570
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to the network there's a lot of</font>

66
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,010
data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have available to us you</font>

67
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,829
know it starts at the end point we have

68
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,390
that with a AV we expand it out now we

69
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,460
have network security intelligence where

70
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,049
we're looking at IES firewalls we

71
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,350
started actually doing correlation rules

72
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,550
you know fairly simple your sim use case

73
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,930
then we started incorporating threat

74
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,030
intelligence and now we're dealing with

75
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,820
even more information more complex

76
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,200
correlations does anyone here actually

77
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,590
write rules for your sim does anyone

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,780
here like writing rules for your son

79
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,400
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always one all right but you</font>

80
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,010
know from this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great for us</font>

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we get started actually doing these</font>

82
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,359
correlations because we learn a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

83
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,649
about who's attacking us particularly

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,300
some of the threat intelligence stuff

85
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,010
that's been coming through with sticks

86
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,100
and taxi we're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share a lot more</font>

87
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">information but it's really difficult to</font>

88
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">write those correlation rules and</font>

89
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,690
sometimes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't actually identify all</font>

90
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,130
those different patterns particularly

91
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we talk about zero-day threats and</font>

92
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,820
i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about particularly around</font>

93
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,140
insider threat or advanced adversaries

94
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,579
usually when you're dealing with

95
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,220
compromised credentials and things like

96
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,660
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to data science</font>

97
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm gonna be focusing mostly on machine</font>

98
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,750
learning because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the area</font>

99
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">of interest right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was really</font>

100
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited actually see that there's a lot</font>

101
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,900
of machine learning talks it besides and

102
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,208
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of list some of those at the</font>

103
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i highly recommend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a look</font>

104
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some of those and my goal here is to</font>

105
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,640
have you guys have a nun basic

106
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,130
understanding of machine learning and

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,250
data science concepts so that when you

108
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,720
go there you guys will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be experts I</font>

109
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,310
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is actually from</font>

110
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,709
an internal Google document where

111
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,200
they're talking about leveraging machine

112
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,209
learning so apply machine learning like

113
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,859
the great engineer you are not like the

114
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,780
great machine learning expert you aren't

115
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,980
right so what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do is we</font>

116
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,060
can leverage things like machine

117
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,100
learning but we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be data</font>

118
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,810
scientists ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> all walk through</font>

119
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,040
how some of those models get created in

120
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,689
the process

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,450
you guys will sort of understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

122
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,549
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend your time doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

123
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,228
there are a lot of tools out there a lot

124
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">of more things like you be a type tools</font>

125
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:20,320
and I'll talk a little bit about that

126
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">how they work that you can actually</font>

127
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,550
leverage but you also need to have an

128
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,110
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of some of those</font>

129
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms the pickling when you're buying a</font>

130
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,720
machine learning product sometimes but

131
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:37,630
there's what I call Dana Scientology

132
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,639
that's actually happening particularly

133
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,719
what we're talking about with the

134
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,340
marketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms when you guys are</font>

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,780
walking the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat you probably</font>

136
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,150
this year in RSA you're going to hear a

137
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,469
lot about machine learning and a lot of

138
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,609
times some of these security tools

139
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,380
aren't actually using machine learning

140
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,139
they're just doing advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlations</font>

141
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,490
or maybe some statistics so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

142
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,620
walk you guys through and you'll

143
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,910
understand some of the terms understand

144
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,650
the difference being unsupervised which

145
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,120
is supervised so that when these vendors

146
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,948
come up to you you can ask those kind of

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,020
questions what's sort of machine

148
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,180
learning area guys leveraging what sort

149
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,349
of grass how does this work because I

150
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's really important for us to</font>

151
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,639
understand how those black boxes

152
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,229
function just an example of some of the

153
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did a little word cloud these are all</font>

154
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different terms I saw around data</font>

155
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,349
science and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really confusing</font>

156
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,320
there's just a lot of kind of words soup

157
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,550
I think I'm going to start a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

158
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,250
with big data because that's sort of how

159
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,220
love the data science got started and

160
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,500
this is the definition I looked up and I

161
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,789
really thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was funny because if</font>

162
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,300
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual example sentence</font>

163
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:42,820
here they say of how to lever how to use

164
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,560
the big data in a sentence right so much

165
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,870
IT investment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going towards managing</font>

166
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,300
and maintaining big data so it's not

167
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,860
talking about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value that you're</font>

168
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,539
actually getting out of leverage and big

169
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,690
data but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost</font>

170
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,580
right of collecting this information and

171
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,199
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I also have here it's</font>

172
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,240
let's solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this problem by using big</font>

173
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,310
data that none of us have the slightest

174
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,320
idea what to do with and I see this time

175
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,150
and time again I'm even seeing sis owes

176
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,949
do this with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other customers I go</font>

177
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,120
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they start collecting a</font>

178
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,620
lot of information they think that

179
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,389
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information at</font>

180
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,979
some point but what they end up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

181
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,680
just storing that information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

182
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,729
of times that data becomes a liability

183
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,169
particularly when you have log data in

184
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,060
there

185
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,560
I have credit card information you're

186
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,629
actually open yourself for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

187
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,909
liability as a result of that and

188
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes I t IT guys don't quite</font>

189
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,319
understand that so that's when with big

190
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,840
data we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about when the shark</font>

191
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,060
actually jumps you big data was a big

192
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzzword and so a lot of IT</font>

193
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,930
organizations started gathering this

194
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,248
information and then security guys are

195
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,039
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also make sense of this</font>

196
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">information here's terabytes of data or</font>

197
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,998
petabytes of data you know what threats

198
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,279
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys find in this information</font>

199
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,210
and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to do</font>

200
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,969
particularly when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to security</font>

201
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,430
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of insight that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

202
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:58,800
actually get from big data from

203
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">information but the trick is whether</font>

204
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,999
it's security or not is actually

205
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,799
identifying and asking the questions

206
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,180
what we want to do with this data what

207
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,039
sort of data sources do we want to

208
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish this we don't</font>

209
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily have to grab every single</font>

210
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,120
possible piece of data to bring it into

211
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,758
the environment and with security it's

212
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,740
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big data so if you're</font>

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,439
actually doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow full packet</font>

214
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,509
capture you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a big</font>

215
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,189
data for a long time and security we all

216
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,319
of our tools are very noisy they

217
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,449
generate a lot of a lot of machine data

218
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,919
and when we're dealing with security

219
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:36,979
we're actually dealing with morbidly

220
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,960
obese data in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways right so</font>

221
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,979
it's it's almost sometimes ridiculous

222
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,899
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> information we're actually</font>

223
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:44,878
dealing with and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good to</font>

224
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:47,009
sort of narrow the focus identify key

225
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,270
data sources and what sort of reports

226
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,680
were gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually generate from that</font>

227
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,529
what sort of threats are we actually

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,270
looking for I'll be the first to say

229
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,460
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all data is security</font>

230
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,378
relevant right but not necessarily all

231
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,210
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data you're going to want</font>

232
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,819
to look for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know time series</font>

233
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,289
information time<font color="#CCCCCC"> stands I p addresses</font>

234
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,270
and things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

235
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,270
necessarily need you know the entire of

236
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,089
like the contents of a log event for

237
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,529
example and there's a term that comes up

238
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:18,180
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and data lake and basically what</font>

239
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,639
what this means when I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in ID</font>

240
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,349
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think oh so you guys have a</font>

241
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,120
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't know</font>

242
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,090
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do with it but</font>

243
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,860
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start collecting</font>

244
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,080
that information and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

245
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,910
sort of becomes right particularly for

246
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,338
security these data lakes are not going

247
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,469
to be particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful if it's just a</font>

248
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of stagnant data when we're</font>

249
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,490
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with data it has a half-life the</font>

250
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,469
longer we have that information that

251
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">less valuable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is our</font>

252
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,000
adversaries they change their tactics

253
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,980
their tools constantly so if we're

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,240
holding on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information the attack</font>

255
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,790
information that we're actually running

256
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,220
models on a year ago it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

257
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,689
be relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so we want to do is we</font>

258
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually i'll talk a little bit</font>

259
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,860
how we make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data flow so there's</font>

260
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,380
some differences but then between<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

261
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,600
data versus data science and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to</font>

262
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,850
compare this as hoarders versus an

263
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazon warehouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right anyone see the</font>

264
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:14,710
show hoarders<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so the idea here</font>

265
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,660
is like people collected all this all

266
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,820
this crap and their house they can't get

267
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,339
rid of it they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's like it's</font>

268
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,800
a mental disorder almost but with a

269
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,680
amazon warehouse the idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

270
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,029
information in and get sorry to get

271
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,609
things in and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out it has</font>

272
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,500
throughput right in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and</font>

273
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,930
actually to accomplish that they'd have

274
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be highly efficient they have to be</font>

275
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,810
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tag those particular packages to</font>

276
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,459
actually get it out of the door so what

277
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,560
we're doing is we're talking about

278
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,060
collection versus insight when we

279
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,729
actually start applying data science to

280
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,040
our data flows we're actually able to

281
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">gain insight from that versus just</font>

282
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,469
warning that information so we want to

283
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big big data flow we want to move</font>

284
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,390
beyond just the data leg but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

285
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,950
move<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of flowing type of</font>

286
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,189
environment that's how we're actually

287
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,839
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain insight and so one way we</font>

288
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,880
can accomplish that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is with what's</font>

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,870
called a lambda architecture you guys

290
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,449
know where this is from am i dating

291

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,839
lambda right so so you know landed

294
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,089
physics actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> represents half life or</font>

295
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,339
a wavelength it's also a pretty awesome

296
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,139
game right it has a symbol for<font color="#CCCCCC"> halfway</font>

297
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,249
the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> game but a lambda architecture</font>

298
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,620
soul and architecture is useful

299
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:35,769
framework to think about designing big

300
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,899
data applications Nathan Mars who worked

301
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,459
at Twitter he designed this generic

302
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,740
architecture for addressing common

303
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,359
requirements for big data based on his

304
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,730
experience working on distributed data

305
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,439

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,120
architecture is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data processing</font>

307
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,639
architecture it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to handle</font>

308
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,110
massive quantities of data by<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

310
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,249
processing methods this approach talk to

311
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:00,009
the architecture attempts to balance

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,029
real-time stream processing to provide

317
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,800
views of streaming online data there's a

318
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,240
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of kind of technical gobbledygook</font>

319
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,628
what it actually allows us to do is to

320
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of massive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets we</font>

323
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,920
processes on that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this is</font>

324
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,699
important to this is where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

325
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see a lot of machine learning</font>

326
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:28,929
algorithms leverage that data but then

327
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,939
we're also able to look at real time

328
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,649
information as well and then we're able

329
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:35,110
to run queries and we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

330
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,389
this information flowing through so if

331
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a lot of the tools for</font>

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:40,480
machine learning for security this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

333
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,449
the type of architectures they're

334
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,249
actually built on top of and if you want

335
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little technical try to build</font>

336
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,129
your own these are sort of some of the

337
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,009
tools the open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools you're going</font>

342
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,079
recommend this book it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font>

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:03,399
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> by uh Nathan Mars from Twitter</font>

344
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,949
and how he actually built out this

first<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe three to four chapters i</font>

349
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,100
highly recommend we should understand a

350
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,930
little bit more how that works so now

351
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,050
we're talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

information how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it to flow so now</font>

visor Conway it's a Venn diagram the the

data science Venn diagram where it kind

358
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,430
of talks about all the different skill

359
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,439
sets that are actually are important for

360
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,089
for data science you know the hacking

361
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,399
skills are not necessarily you know

like that we're familiar with it's

364
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually more just command line skills</font>

365
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,839
right the ability to collect and

366
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,670
manipulate and extract data and how to

that's where I get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little scared</font>

data science they're just wizards when

it comes to this understand math and

373
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,430
statistics which requires at least a

there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this report that's really</font>

384
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,380
popular it talks about all the

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,480
vulnerabilities that are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

386
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,250
that are targeting organizations here's

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top 5 vulnerabilities one of them</font>

came from some data scientists and they

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,239
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to pull this</font>

information from IBS and vulnerability

393
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,690
management applications but they didn't

394
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite realize is that there's a lot of</font>

395
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,190
false positives in that data so data

396
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">scientists they may go look at the data</font>

397
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,300
but without any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of knowledge when</font>

398
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,980
it comes to security they they don't

399
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">really understand how to make sense of</font>

400
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,100
it and they start to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions</font>

401
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,270
and that's that's where things get

402
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,790
really dangerous when we start talking

403
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:11,079
about this danger zone here right so you

404
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,430
have the skills just enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that experience it's a lot of</font>

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">things can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fall apart so when I talk</font>

408
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">about machine learning a lot of times</font>

409
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,430
people will say oh you know it's AI

410
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,969
they're going to come take<font color="#E5E5E5"> my job I</font>

salaries are increasing the goal here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

414
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,250
actually leveraging data science and

machine learning is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace you</font>

the goal is to enhance you so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

417
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,100
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's going to look like so</font>

418
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,910
leveraging things like machine learning

419
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,769
we're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify</font>

420
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,719
patterns we're going to see things in

421
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,790
our environments in our data that we

422
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,160
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see before so that's the</font>

423
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,779
whole idea of this and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

424
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,579
too if you actually leverage machine

425
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:55,579
learning you don't have to hire may be

426
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:57,709
quite as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many analysts but you'll also</font>

427
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,758
have a fatter paycheck as well if you

428
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,758
actually understand some of these

429
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:05,360
concepts and can deploy them so some of

430
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,930
the tools that are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in for</font>

431
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,089
machine learning there's java<font color="#E5E5E5"> the skela</font>

432

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,720
you're going to see a data scientist

00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,160
Hughes I stick with Python because

435
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,959
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I know how to</font>

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,910
program is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> shady programmer and</font>

437
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know python so that's what I work with</font>

438
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,569
and in Python there is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

439
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:28,519
cool library called scikit-learn so is

440
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:31,639
anyone use this library before curious

441
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,050
so you kind of here sigh how many of you

442
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,069
are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using machine learning in</font>

443
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:39,620
your environments very cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome it's</font>

444
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see so there's a lot of</font>

445
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,309
algorithms that actually come with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

446
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,040
this you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look here if you</font>

447
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,660
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a gorillaz for</font>

448
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,069
classification regression and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

449
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,250
of go through and define some of those

450
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:53,569
and what they are but one of the

451
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,550
challenges too is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to</font>

452
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,990
visualize that information I think one

453
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,029
of the critical things for the analyst

454
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,350
is not necessarily just gaining that

455
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,000
insight but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make</font>

456
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,279
that information useful to the analyst

457
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,059
so it makes sense to them and so what I

458
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,029
actually is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk they actually have</font>

459
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,170
a machine learning toolkit that's free

460
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:13,610
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> download the free</font>

461
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,439
version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk and you can run all</font>

462
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">these exercises i'm walking through i'm</font>

463
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,879
actually going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

464
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,529
demos actually you can download<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font>

465
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,010
directly from their website you run a

466
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:25,020
local on your computer with

467
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,450
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you install this</font>

468
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,829
application and then it'll show you

469
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,840
there's another dependent application

470
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,640
that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> install and you're good</font>

471
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,170
to go and the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about this is</font>

472
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,090
that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

473
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,500
visualization there's all sorts of

474
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,680
visualizations that are available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

475
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,180
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can run and create models and they</font>

476
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">create these nice visualizations without</font>

477
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,560
having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess with a bunch of other</font>

478
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,550
dependencies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of lazy so trying</font>

479
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to install</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these different dependencies</font>

480
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,870
and do visualization and pythons really

481
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,420
hard and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes more time than i want</font>

482
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,740
to spend on it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to talk a</font>

483
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,500
little bit about different types of

484
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,900
machine learning there's two main types

485
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,370
there's supervised machine learning

486
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,050
where the focus is to build models that

487
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,790
make predictions based on evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

488
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,310
labeled data in the presence of

489
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,050
uncertainty as adaptive algorithms

490
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,329
identify patterns and data it sort of

491
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,369
learned from those observations and you

492
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,139
create models as a result of that then

493
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,208
you have unsupervised machine learning

494
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,829
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we're able to draw for</font>

495
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,600
instance from<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets that may not</font>

496
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,069
have labels and I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

497
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,889
differences between label and unlabeled

498
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,500
data there's also semi-supervised

499
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,660
machine learning which<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a little</font>

500
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,470
more advanced but it's talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

501
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:37,260
about using labeled data to to go out

502
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually label unlabeled unlabeled</font>

503
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,620
data so for we're able to do supervised

504
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,439
learning we're generalized from from

505
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,629
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled data so this is an</font>

506
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,170
example we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to identify that</font>

507
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:55,110
usually that data sort of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> table but</font>

508
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,850
just nice visualization there of it

509
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,219
supervised machine learning there's

510
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,139
three core areas while that it's

511
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,730
actually used so regression so a

512
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,410
regression problem is when the output

513
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,330
variable is a real value such as

514
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,970
authorizations over time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

515
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">some examples of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> classification is</font>

516
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,380
a classification problem when the output

517
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,880
variable is a category sort of could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

518
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,550
binary be malicious non-malicious

519
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,980
authorized or not authorized spam not

520
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,270
spam and then you have a nominally

521
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,559
detection where you're able to identify

522
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,330
unusual activity

523
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">what normal looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like example would be</font>

524
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,418
a history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of normal web authorizations</font>

525
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,700
that then identify anything

526
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:34,809
significantly different this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also be</font>

527
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,039
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in fraud right so here's sort</font>

528
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,370
of the process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through with</font>

529
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,379
to create a supervised machine learning

530
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,320
algorithm right so we have raw security

531
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:46,748
event data the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientists will</font>

532
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,490
create take a sample he'll start

533
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:50,259
developing and training the model and

534
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">then he'll test that and it's a highly</font>

535
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:56,789
iterative process he'll write an

536
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,440
algorithm and then he'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a product</font>

537
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:00,610
right but he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done yet a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

538
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,470
times when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they write these algorithm</font>

539
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,539
has one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have you know to run</font>

540
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">these models on very clean data but when</font>

541
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually release these out into the</font>

542
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,669
real world and look at real data that's

543
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,619
when sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> things will fall apart</font>

544
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:14,409
and the wheels will come off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

545
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:18,009
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a sort of</font>

546
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:20,049
verification process then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

547
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,179
move that into production so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

548
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar to a process you might have</font>

549
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:26,769
for may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing correlation rules</font>

550
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDRs rules firewall rules so just</font>

551
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,879
imagine that process but maybe 10 times

552
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,049
more complex more math and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

553
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:37,928
profanity and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what it might</font>

554
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:40,480
look like so this is a sample so maybe

555
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:44,350
we're running a model where we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

556
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to identify malicious domains so it's</font>

557
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and it can identify using</font>

558
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:51,850
this is all sort of tagged in from

559
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:54,399
tagged data anything create and identify

560
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,379
that yes these two are<font color="#E5E5E5"> malicious you</font>

561
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:59,139
know hey string of consonants you know

562
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:02,469
numbers all these sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

563
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:04,149
has identified a malicious domains what

564
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,860
it's actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at is a list of</font>

565
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:09,039
known malicious domains so you have to

566
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,928
have a list of known malicious domains

567
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,309
to run this sort of thing where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

568
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,899
actually start to differentiate and

569
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,899
identify the differences between those

570
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,919
so with supervised machine learning with

571
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:22,179
regression so it's used for predictive

572
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,240
modeling to investigate the relationship

573
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:27,460
between a dependent target and

574
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,899
independent variable so a few examples

575
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">of algorithms that you're going to run</font>

576
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:34,189
into so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know memorize these</font>

577
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:37,170
using the cocktail parties it sounds

578
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to focus just here on linear</font>

579
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,400
regression in our example is when you're

580
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,750
in right<font color="#E5E5E5"> into quite a bit so I'm going</font>

581
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a demo where we're actually going</font>

582
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,250
to predict VPN usage so let's say you've

583
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,490
been tasked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifying or</font>

584
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,560
predicting how much our VPN is going to

585
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,660
be used and I know this never happens

586
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,760
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT guys they forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable</font>

587
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,700
logging on the VPN never happens in real

588
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,140
life I know but so what we're going to

589
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,400
do is we're going to actually look at

590
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,380
internal applications we're going to

591
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,730
look at how they're used and we know

592
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in order to use the natural</font>

593
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,960
application have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> access the VPN so we</font>

594
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,770
can make prediction about a VPN usage

595
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,580
based on that information so without

596
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,580
further ado

597
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,159
please work

598
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,790
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSV file the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dap</font>

599
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,250
usage is basically that same data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

600
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,770
showed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here's what it actually looks</font>

601
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,770
like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV file with</font>

602
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,320
the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tagged so i have crm</font>

603
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,820
out of cloud drive erp expenses so what

604
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm actually doing here is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing</font>

605
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,950
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crm the cloud drive HR and</font>

606
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,469
webmail i'm going to use those<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my</font>

607
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:54,350
prediction then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can run this</font>

608
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">I fit this to the model takes a bit to</font>

609
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,389
run and this maps it out to me so

610
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,910
remember what I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why i use</font>

611
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,890
blunt for the visualization right this

612
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,380
is super<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple this is built in and</font>

613
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,910
into the app so i don't have to create

614
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,980
the visualization and actually plots it

615
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:14,840
out so what's doing is actually showing

616
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,610
that the VPN usage of based on the usage

617
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,379
of these applications so we can start to

618
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,510
make predictions based on that so I

619
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what the actual VPN did is</font>

620
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,750
but I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a relationship</font>

621
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:27,070
between the applications and again and

622
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,070
then I'm able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make these predictions</font>

623
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,799
so another one is with machine learning

624
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,750
classification so classification we have

625
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,850
data we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort into predetermined</font>

626
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,520
categories so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be using</font>

627
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,540
binary classification so it's a it's a

628
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,620
little bit different than some other

629
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,230
ones where we're actually looking at

630
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,570
yes/no true/false so again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> treta</font>

631
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys really kind of dumb down and fairly</font>

632
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:58,270
simple so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what our CSV file</font>

633
00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:00,739
looks like an Excel we've cleaned it up

634
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,480
so here's our basically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

635
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,210
training data set that's been cleaned up

636
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,130
for us we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data samples from</font>

637
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,780
multiple firewalls some of the firewalls

638
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,970
we know are affected by malware and have

639
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,590
critical vulnerabilities we may know

640
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,179
that the number of our firewalls are

641
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,620
affected by a critical vulnerability but

642
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,030
are not sure if they've been exploited

643
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">by malware targeting that vulnerability</font>

644
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,500
or the inverse may be the case where we

645
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,419
suddenly see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of firewalls hit</font>

646
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,650
by malware and we want to identify if

647
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:27,260
they're affected actually by a known

648
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,059
vulnerability right so this is again is

649
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,820
another example of important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

650
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,500
domain expertise so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing is</font>

651
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,659
there's a slight anomaly in the data

652
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,940
that hints at malware behavior then we

653
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,250
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular host has known</font>

654
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,970
vulnerabilities to actually predict make

655
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,160
a prediction so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do example</font>

656
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,240
demo gods so in classification we have

657
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,620
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to sort in to</font>

658
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,840
predetermine categories so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

659
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,840
click on this work

660
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:01,029
so here I'm bringing in that firewall

661
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,859
traffic CSV data so here what I've done

662
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,769
I'm going to be projecting is you know

663
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:08,439
is this firewall affected by malware so

664
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:11,349
some of the fields<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm bringing is byte</font>

665
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,209
received by sent destination port if it

666
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:14,198
has a known vulnerability or not maybe

667
00:24:13,209 --> 00:24:16,149
the baby this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming from our</font>

668
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:18,429
vulnerability management tool packets

669
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:20,849
received packets sent I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then run and</font>

670
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,849
fit my model

671
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,889
so now we were down here with our

672
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:34,418
classification results so what this does

673
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it's looking at the data and it's</font>

674
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:40,419
actually looked at how successful was

675
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:42,849
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this prediction so for the the</font>

676
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,830
predicted know is it affected by malware

677
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:48,029
it has an eighty-three percent

678
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,139
confidence predicting yes it has a

679
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:52,059
seventy-eight percent confidence and I

680
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:53,649
can add additional fields maybe if I

681
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,269
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them roof remove one let's say I</font>

682
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,799
remove I don't know if it's vulnerable

683
00:24:55,269 --> 00:25:07,720
or not there's a vulnerability on that

684
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:09,700
host takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> will run process so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

685
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,190
have the ability cricket is a ninety

686
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,450
percent but with our know there's not

687
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:24,070
really confidence it's all about

688
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:26,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifty-fifty so another one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be anomaly</font>

689
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,178
detection numeric outliers so what we're

690
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:30,989
going to do is look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in versus</font>

691
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:30,989
predicted over time

692
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,440
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see we have our login page</font>

693
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're actually have cleaned up that data</font>

694
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,159
we loaded it in so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

695
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,600
identify any sort of anomalies that are

696
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,610
there outside the norm it's sort of

697
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,320
established as this baseline and we see

698
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,668
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outliers right that are</font>

699
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually in this graph another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

700
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:58,850
nice thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the visualization so let's</font>

701
00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:03,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">say I want to update the threshold for</font>

702
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:07,939
this so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have fewer outliers of</font>

703
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,320
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I see that okay</font>

704
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,649
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's happening here</font>

705
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,270
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of having the</font>

706
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:18,139
subset experience when it comes to this

707
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:20,179
so on November 26 we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked right</font>

708
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,010
all of a sudden had a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

709
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:27,620
logging into our e-commerce website and

710
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:30,408
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to hack us right no black</font>

711
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,389
friday right so there's sort this sort

712
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:33,860
of thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machines they don't</font>

713
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,630
know about black friday they don't about

714
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,889
holidays so you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and</font>

715
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">train the model and you would add some</font>

716
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,500
more additional exceptions and things

717
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,449
like that to the model so it understands

718
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,820
that or you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes</font>

719
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,250
through you pass this to your to your

720
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">incentive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responders and you know it's a</font>

721
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">false positive so this is just a few</font>

722
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,049
examples of actually supervised machine

723
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,970
learning so as you can see it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

724
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">work to go through this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process you're</font>

725
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,390
actually creating these models making

726
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,730
assumptions you're looking at the data

727
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you're constantly tweaking it just</font>

728
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,669
it takes quite a bit of work I have a

729
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,830
lot of respect for the folks that

730
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:12,279
actually leverage this now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

731
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,629
talk about unsupervised machine learning

732
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,640
so unsupervised machine learns where you

733
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,279
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no labels in the data so we had</font>

734
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,080
nice columns of information before with

735
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,270
our supervised machine learning with

736
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">this we don't know a good example of</font>

737
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I think a good analogy is</font>

738
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,320
Netflix so when we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at movies</font>

739
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,330
oh we know hey there's romance action

740
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,770
right those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that's a good</font>

741
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,720
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of supervised machine learning</font>

742
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,270
things were telling the system and we're

743
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,070
categorizing that with unsupervised

744
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,049
machine learning it's more like okay

745
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">well maybe things we don't know about</font>

746
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:45,609
identifying

747
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:49,329
did you know that girls between 12 and

748
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:53,320
30 like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Renee Zellweger types of movies</font>

749
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:55,658
it's maybe not always rom-com but

750
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,979
there's a lot of insight that let people

751
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,139
like Netflix can actually gain from that

752
00:27:56,979 --> 00:28:01,089
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> result of it maybe for marketing</font>

753
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:02,918
purposes and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

754
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:04,029
also do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our adversaries</font>

755
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:05,769
particularly when we're talking about

756
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:07,929
user behavior and we'll show some

757
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,129
examples of that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

758
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,349
identify anomalies within our

759
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:12,759
environment so unsupervised machine

760
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:14,259
learning is the general understanding of

761
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,629
the present data by discovering hidden

762
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:19,329
patterns so in contrast again to

763
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:21,070
supervised learning we are working with

764
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:23,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that is not marked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or indicated</font>

765
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">by labels and here are some examples</font>

766
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:26,559
again of some algorithms that you're

767
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to run if you're going to come up</font>

768
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">again use these cocktail parties sound</font>

769
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">smart the most popular one you're going</font>

770
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear about is k-means and that's what</font>

771
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:39,249
most most folks use to actually identify

772
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:40,658
these clusters the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unsupervised machine</font>

773
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:42,459
learning process looks a little simpler

774
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:43,839
you have raw security data you have an

775
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:47,859
algorithm and then it has a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

776
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,299
automated clustering and primarily where

777
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,908
this is going to be used is going to be

778
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:54,549
and called<font color="#CCCCCC"> you EBA easy be called just</font>

779
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">UVA but Gardner change that now its user</font>

780
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,239
entity behavior analytics and really

781
00:28:56,979 --> 00:29:00,729
it's used a lot for identifying

782
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,929
authorized unauthorized users using

783
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:04,269
authorized credentials do an

784
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:05,769
unauthorized things so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an area</font>

785
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,229
of security that's very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

786
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,719
for sims 2 to track sims are really good

787
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:12,549
at knowing about you know known threats

788
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:14,889
incorporating threat intelligence may be

789
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:17,349
bringing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF signatures and things</font>

790
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:18,758
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what about attacks that</font>

791
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:20,678
don't have those signatures compromised

792
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,599
credentials or if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using</font>

793
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,549
advanced malware to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

795
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,168
malicious insider who's accessing data

796
00:29:26,829 --> 00:29:32,979
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should so a couple of interesting</font>

797
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:35,139
use cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UVA helps with is a</font>

798
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:38,079
account takeover so privileged account

799
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:39,458
compromised data exfiltration when you

800
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,379
have lateral movement within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> orca</font>

801
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:43,490
within a network as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as good at</font>

802
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:47,030
detecting that any

803
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:50,210
vicious activity malware attacks botnet

804
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,100
commanding control especially like

805
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,260
things like ransomware the where the c2

806
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,090
infrastructure is constantly changing

807
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,830
you can't necessarily rely on just on

808
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,740
threat intelligence particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

809
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,590
some of the more sophisticated ranch

810
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,720
modes coming out you also do user in any

811
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,939
behavior analytics as well so suspicious

812
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,530
behavior by accounts or devices so it

813
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,260
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised credentials or it can</font>

814
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,780
be compromised systems so I really like

815
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sans about a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago they</font>

816

<font color="#CCCCCC">had this it was a summit for any</font>

817
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,559
response and threat honey and they

818
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeled out the this</font>

819
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,970
threatening maturity model where you

820
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,040
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most folks are using ad hoc search</font>

821
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,110
statistical analysis visualization

822
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,300
techniques and aggregation so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

823
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,729
have you know basic log search we have

824
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe creating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some dashboard</font>

825
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,530
visualizations leveraging our sim we

826
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:41,450
have maybe event even up to it some

827
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,710
advanced correlations and then what

828
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,880
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to see is more machine</font>

829
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,890
learning and data science being

830
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,120
leveraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually pulled them now</font>

831
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are Intendant in</font>

832
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,570
attendance and this is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

833
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,010
out to at least eighty five percent or

834
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,678
using search you kind of have to have

835
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so even if you identify something</font>

836
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,490
strange here you have to be able to go

837
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,219
back and access the original Law data

838
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,700
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear of forensic analysis</font>

839
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:06,200
cystic analysis fifty-five percent

840
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,150
visualization techniques around 50 so

841
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty two percent are leveraging</font>

842
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,080
something in the this machine learning

843
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,850
data science area either they're doing

844
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,740
it directly themselves are trying to or

845
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're they're using a tool let's look</font>

846
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,429
an existing security tool that maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

847
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">an add-on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or like what we saw with a nap</font>

848
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font>

849
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,400
right Casper<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so how why is he famous</font>

850
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,430
right he's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> famous because he's a</font>

851
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">good chess player he's famous because he</font>

852
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">got his butt kicked by a computer right</font>

853
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,270
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is that what Kasparov</font>

854
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,580
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after he he did get me by</font>

855
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:45,470
computer at chess they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did some</font>

856
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,990
additional exercises where they actually

857
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">did what they called freestyle chest and</font>

858
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:53,030
where they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> found was that a</font>

859
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,130
weak human plus machine and better

860
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,200
process was superior to a strong

861
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,750
computer alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more remarkably</font>

862
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,390
superior to a strong human plus machine

863
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,640
and inferior process so someone who is

864
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:08,120
not necessarily you know good at chess

865
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,880
having machines to strategize it's

866
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,949
really interesting that you know the

867
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,480
combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the strong human the</font>

868
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:19,700
machines and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> front end inferior in</font>

869
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,500
the process were better right so so this

870
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">carries over into what we're doing right</font>

871
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,980
so leveraging machine learning we don't

872
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,170
want to rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely we still</font>

873
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,990
have to have the strong analyst we still

874
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,790
have to have a process around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so one</font>

875
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,770
thing I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about to that we</font>

876
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,740
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to incorporate from data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sciences</font>

877
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,930
threat modeling with graphs so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

878
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,700
some examples of this but grass-based

879
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:42,590
threat commutation we're actually able

880
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build rafts of anomalies and detect</font>

881
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,399
neighborhoods anomalies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to indicate that</font>

882
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,199
there's malware activity we're able to

883
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,270
do multiple multiple internal node

884
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,730
beaconing as an example the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

885
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">address it's geared towards detecting</font>

886
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,440
malware and those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threats we</font>

887
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,450
also have patterned a space computation

888
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,040
where we actually compute threat based

889
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,830
on patterns that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> observed over</font>

890
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,870
sets of anomalies this is where when you

891
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually are identifying anomalies</font>

892
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,800
within the environment we want to we

893
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,690
want to map it to the threat models

894
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,240
that's where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> substitute experience</font>

895
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,540
comes in so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the the uva</font>

896
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,610
model looks like so what we're doing is

897
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,190
we're bringing in wrong security data

898
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,699
we're running machine learning and a lot

899
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UVA tools it will use</font>

900
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,690
combination of unsupervised machine

901
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,389
learning machine learning system

902
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,550
analysis a lot of other components and

903
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,960
and algorithms will actually be

904
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,720
leveraged<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually identify those</font>

905
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,910
anomalies they can even incorporate

906
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,870
things like Fred intelligence data so a

907
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,700
lot of the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're already</font>

908
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,979
collecting and using in your sin you can

909
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually bring into these systems and it</font>

910
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,330
will start to identify some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

911
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,100
anomalies then what we do is using the

912
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:53,350
graph mining<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept so here we use an</font>

913
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">ominous graph on any relationships but</font>

914
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,199
that'll actually do is it will start to

915
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,630
score and it will look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for connections</font>

916
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,090
and those anomalies and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

917
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,650
what we have is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call anomaly</font>

918
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">change we actually do is identify the</font>

919
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:09,100
threats right so now what we're doing is

920
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,949
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is we see an anomaly from a</font>

921
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,960
strange IP address we see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

922
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:17,139
an endpoint of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connected that IP</font>

923
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,540
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and we're able to see that</font>

924
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,310
hey there's a registry change and then

925
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,750
we see some weakening activity out to

926
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,850
another IP address or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

927
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,500
right so now we're able to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

928
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just an anomaly something strange</font>

929
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,650
that happen because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go chasing</font>

930
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,780
those anomalies you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a</font>

931
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,330
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time you think you know firewalls</font>

932
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,580
and ids false positives were paying a

933
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,679
few go chasing anomalies that it's

934
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,179
almost a dead end a lot of times and

935
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a been a challenge with</font>

936
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,319
some of the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> uva types of tools is</font>

937
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,250
that people would get these anomalies

938
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,500
and they wouldn't have the information

939
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,840
to do anything with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay something</font>

940
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,400
strange happened what does this mean

941
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,290
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> my environment I don't understand</font>

942
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,850
right but when we start to chain them

943
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,500
together and we actually identify those

944
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,259
threats it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more</font>

945
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,240
sent to the analyst so then then we map

946
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:05,140
that the threat model so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we may map it</font>

947
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,689
to you know lateral movement right so be

948
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,279
key

949
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,069
all the different threat models that we

950
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,349
would consider in our organization we

951
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:13,670
start to map those nominees you know is

952
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:15,170
this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this look like lateral</font>

953
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,210
movement does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this look like beaconing</font>

954
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,180
land speed violation you guys know what

955
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is Superman problem basically if if</font>

956
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in here from Las Vegas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

957
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,220
all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden I log in from Moscow</font>

958
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,440
there's no physical way i can actually

959
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,359
you know be in two places at once right

960
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,670
so those are you know based<font color="#CCCCCC"> off geoip</font>

961
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,440
things like that and then we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

962
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,210
we map that course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HDI but it's like</font>

963
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,560
the human component where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

964
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,390
can map those threat models when we do

965
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,029
the visualization where let's map that

966
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:43,220
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lockheed Martin kill chain so if</font>

967
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,319
we're talking about this particular case

968
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,379
here is like hey we see where the the

969
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:49,700
actual where they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got in we see</font>

970
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there was some lateral movement</font>

971
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,029
where they were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting data</font>

972
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,920
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an</font>

973
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,839
exfiltration event and we can actually

974
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">map that out and visualize it for the</font>

975
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,920
analyst and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we can also go in and</font>

976
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,930
do forensic artifacts we gather other

977
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,430
information so now the analyst can not

978
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,140
only identify that there's a threat he

979
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,669
sees the connection it can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> dig</font>

980
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,819
deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually look at those events</font>

981
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,920
and and either you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pass that off to</font>

982
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,930
someone else to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and remediate those</font>

983
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,670
systems or identify that we have a

984
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,569
larger problem this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> larger</font>

985
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:25,099
attack as well and also threatened risk

986
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:27,109
learning things like that so so that is

987
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for my presentation since you guys</font>

988
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:33,078
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop in for almost like 40 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

989
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,848
talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> data science</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

990
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,119
your doctorate of divinity in data

991
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,980
science you guys are all amount PhDs so

992
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,550
we get your slide print the South show

993
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,380
to your employer<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I think</font>

994
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really interesting that there's a</font>

995
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,140
lot of great talks on machine learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

996
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:50,990
want to highlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other</font>

997
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,290
talks that are happening this one here

998
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,270
is Joseph day

999
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,130
and rod said oh they're friends of mine

1000
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really recommend taking a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1001
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,440
one but these all look really

1002
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,210
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1003
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,700
interesting how machine learning is

1004
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,260
actually being leveraged it's gone from

1005
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,419
you know something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was sort of</font>

1006
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,800
theoretical to some of the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1007
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen actually identifying some these</font>

1008
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,060
threats I've seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1009
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customers I'm on site with where</font>

1010
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,390
they've started to run these tools it

1011
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,700
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know can take anywhere</font>

1012
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,839
from about six weeks before you'll

1013
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,450
actually start to identify those

1014
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,980
anomalies and it's very different than

1015
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,049
your SEM use case where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write</font>

1016
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the correlation and see it now it takes</font>

1017
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about six weeks or so for it's actually</font>

1018
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:31,080
learn what normal is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

1019
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,089
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting even highly</font>

1020
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,920
sophisticated security organizations

1021
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,200
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their maturity is very high</font>

1022
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,790
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good correlation rules</font>

1023
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,169
are able to identify a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threats</font>

1024
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,450
they're finding things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

1025
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,950
wouldn't have seen before right so I

1026
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that machine when he isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1027
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,210
to replace your existing security best

1028
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,040
practices it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to replace your</font>

1029
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,270
sim but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's going to</font>

1030
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,009
enhance your the analyst it's going to

1031
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,600
enhance your security program you're

1032
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,330
going to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> threats you didn't see</font>

1033
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,250
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing I found two is that</font>

1034
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:02,040
you'll start to look at anomalies right

1035
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,270
so the the socks can look at the threats

1036
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,390
they're going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the chain of</font>

1037
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,890
anomalies whereas your hunters they

1038
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,629
might might actually go dig into those

1039
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,549
anomalies specifically because a lot of

1040
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,720
times what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll find is that is this</font>

1041
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,220
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe one of our</font>

1042
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,319
correlation rules and our sim should

1043
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,850
have picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and sometimes it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so</font>

1044
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,980
will allow them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also go through and</font>

1045
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:23,520
fine-tune some of those those their

1046
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,190
correlation rules as well so and that is

1047
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,140
it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk a little bit early i'm</font>

1048
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:32,520
on twitter k weston feel free to email

1049
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,230
me death threats what are orcs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

1050
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,430
we have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of some time for</font>

1051
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,750
questions I hope you guys look at too

1052
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:40,640
technical on me because again I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1053
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,640
data scientist so any questions

1054
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,270
hey a great talk so far but you

1055
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,160
mentioned using the tooling from<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font>

1056
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,660
for your visualizations and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1057
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,960
modelling you aware of any tools related

1058
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,810
or used for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> elastic search or those</font>

1059
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,640
platforms um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen any further</font>

1060
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">machinery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's anyone else is anyone</font>

1061
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">using elastic and machine learning</font>

1062
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,779
anyone using<font color="#E5E5E5"> elastic machinery</font>

1063
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:48,230
yeah I yeah I use a spoon because I know

1064
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,480
it and it's also where like data that i

1065
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to go and look at is going</font>

1066
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,660
to be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just the tool that</font>

1067
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">use theirs that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to list all</font>

1068
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,328
the different tools there's tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1069
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,730
out there I don't even understand how

1070
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:01,970
some of them work frankly that's well

1071
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,559
well beyond what i do but it's important

1072
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand the what tools that some</font>

1073
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:06,260
of the data scientists are using so at

1074
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,210
least you can understand hey they're

1075
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,020
using scale ax well maybe that's not

1076
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,020
going to work in my environment

1077
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,720
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah actually that's what it's</font>

1078
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,430
going to say if you're if you're doing a

1079
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,819
lot of data sign scientist with like

1080
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:25,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python ipython notebook everybody's</font>

1081
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,790
familiar with that and now there's this

1082
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing called Jupiter notebook that's</font>

1083
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,730
kind of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing and you can</font>

1084
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,190
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of really cool visualizations</font>

1085
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:34,590
with that as well yeah yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1086
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,110
great to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just experimenting and</font>

1087
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,460
learning how these things work I'm never

1088
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become a data scientist myself</font>

1089
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,930
I don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm more of a</font>

1090
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,940
security analyst but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1091
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,919
understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> things work right I don't</font>

1092
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust that hey you know use</font>

1093
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,730
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> sciences black box it can solve all</font>

1094
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,320
your security problems I won't

1095
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,600
understand the differences between the

1096
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,400
different algorithms at least so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1097
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,440
have a conversation with folks when we

1098
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,580
actually look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data it's</font>

1099
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,110
also good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1100
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,090
understand some of those basic concepts

1101
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,770
so when you actually go you funding for

1102
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,290
some of these tools you know what how

1103
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,730
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work well here's here's how we</font>

1104
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually identify new threats and</font>

1105
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,510
things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not necessarily</font>

1106
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,670
important where the data is and how it's

1107
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:17,370
stored you can use elastic you can use

1108
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,950
any sort of other data source like I'm

1109
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">just using CSV files right but you know</font>

1110
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:25,649
the important thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just more around</font>

1111
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,790
the general concepts I think so because

1112
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,470
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> other questions I just want</font>

1113
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a quick comment that there is a</font>

1114
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:32,520
project that I'm working on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

1115
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,109
is exactly that lambda architecture or

1116
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,280
slide that you had in the components and

1117
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,080
things like that it's a new Apache

1118
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,340
project called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metron so people want</font>

1119
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:43,410
apply it wrong yeah great so you more

1120
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions well thanks a lot i really</font>

1121
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,339
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it thanks for having</font>

1122
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,420
you
