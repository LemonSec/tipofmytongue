yeah thank you very much so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,689
you wondering this<font color="#E5E5E5"> many going to talk</font>

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,120
actually no no angler died angles gone

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one way kind of fizzled some people</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,870
are happy i'm going to said i had a

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,490
love-hate relationship an angler so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,220
learning whatever so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,770
about neutrino<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had about five weeks to</font>

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,689
prepare this a research angler on off

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,230
for about two years and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font>

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,029
Gerard hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and then i found out</font>

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,480
i was about to completely revamp my

13
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:34,559
entire presentation so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go let's</font>

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,370
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay our agenda for today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,540
talking about neutrino<font color="#E5E5E5"> not angular we're</font>

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,610
going to talk about what exploit kids

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,899
are how they function how they work and

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,260
then we're going to pull apart a sample

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,820
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus today is on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the x play kick</font>

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,500
portion itself so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,030
focus too much on the actual exploits

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,010
that are being leveraged in there i'll

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,600
mention one moment we will break<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,460
what occurs the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell code that actually</font>

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">runs things of that nature but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auto</font>

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus both mostly on that so for example</font>

27
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit malware that it drops also like</font>

28
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,009
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kind of represent</font>

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,170
longest good all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like this to</font>

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">be kind of a 2d communication so the</font>

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,020
Beast nights<font color="#CCCCCC"> accrue really likes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it when</font>

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,150
people are involved can people

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,830
participate things of that nature and I

34
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,450
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run my dad mom talks people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,000
so it kind of works out right so all

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,010
right

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,640
just pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're just they want</font>

38
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,200
to do it forever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then here's my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,270
we're not talking money angler<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,810
sorry the program's went to press before

41
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,750
I actually officially changed it so no

42
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,490
biggie<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is me I work at</font>

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:47,510
like tens of billions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars over</font>

49

some search and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give a damn</font>

53
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:57,830
so moving on I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run my mouth oh</font>

54
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,649
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I present</font>

pretty good this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> professional photo</font>

71
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,470
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just like to show it</font>

72
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,970
off Rupert hang down

73
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright exploit kids why are they so</font>

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,040
excellent kids this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a business it's a</font>

75
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,050
business of exploiting hosts and getting

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,060
a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> strand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware on to the</font>

77
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,520
greater number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hosts as possible this</font>

78
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,650
is biggest this is a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> computations</font>

79
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,060
of vector based competition so you may

80
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">have heard angular previously if we're</font>

81
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about what happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

82
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,920
angler we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neutrino but in</font>

83
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,960
reality there's three primary actors

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,880
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pretend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's play</font>

85
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,590
for 10 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would hear</font>

86
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
create your own malware I'm sure you

87
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do that right well let's just say</font>

88
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,170
you did it let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say that you</font>

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,269
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread your mouth for the most</font>

90
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,709
number of hosts as possible like how

91
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,390
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go about doing that will you</font>

92
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,700
basically hire someone who runs the

93
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,920
exploit kit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing is you give</font>

94
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,869
them that we're in their goal is spread

95
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,399
it for you so there's three primary

96
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,140
actors there's the campaign so the

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,660
people who redirect the actual traffic

98
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,399
to the exploit kit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploitation</font>

99
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,200
people who run the infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,150
to exploit its bidding box as possible

101
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,739
and there's mal robbers who provide

102
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,100
their valor and then pay for it to be

103
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">distributed so it does so white winter</font>

104
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,180
break time exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how does this little</font>

105
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,030
thing here but the idea is very simple

106
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,190
the exploit kit landing page enumerates

107
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host it checks with capabilities it</font>

108
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,120
looks for non-cash<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer essentially</font>

109
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,270
and sees that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is vulnerable it</font>

110
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,520
just goes right go if it fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fine</font>

111
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,080
but if it works it goes hey that's

112
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,940
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much how it works so you just</font>

113
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast a very wide net you will</font>

114
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,569
the redirect process is pretty simple

115
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host over here the user / your</font>

116
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,129
better yet goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> what he or she believes</font>

117
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,418
is a completely legitimate site there's

118
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,639
some funny ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> good exploited by the</font>

119
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,500
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we searched</font>

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,210
through another dog and when they go to

121
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the site what happens in the back end of</font>

122
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,560
raspberries redirect over a clinical

123
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,479
bulletproof site and that site is what's

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,530
hosting landing page for the exploit kit

125
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is typically there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

126
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,489
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hidden I brains and all</font>

127
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,020
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun stuff user is going to</font>

128
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,710
use even occurring and exploitation

129
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,299
occurs and then oops so in order to move

130
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,489
with a bulletproof sight of that term

131
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,090
for soup you don't catch it can't say

132
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,860
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right someone tell me up let the</font>

133
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,169
monster colleagues they have been copied

134
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:57,130
out right in GT oh yeah I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but</font>

135
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really yeah damn right damn right you</font>

136
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,880
know when there's a problem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

137
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,530
always gets popped right and they have

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,850
open mail relays all the time they're

139
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,650
being abused you send an email to

140
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,060
reviews for parking and have terms of

run the campaign

308
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,880
redirect traffic to the landing pages

309
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,800
right so technically they can be the

310

just without them I

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be happening I would know how</font>

these things work so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting how</font>

349
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:19,489
they help me out here Oh Gregor yep

yeah SF deck free flash decompiler and

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,930
then flash it develop by the way flash

352
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:33,050
developers as far as i know i guess it's

and then you can filed your heart's

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,580
content so what I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is write to the</font>

357
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,700
next block what I do is they wrote the

358
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,770
code out with FF<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech and I turn on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

you just use their<font color="#E5E5E5"> deoxidation you're</font>

363
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,660
like I'll give me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay like</font>

364
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,690
searching without thats go live in hell

365
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,459
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> so then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put the code native</font>

366
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,089
flash develop and then I can debug it

367
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:07,430
and do it early<font color="#CCCCCC"> love one so here's an</font>

368
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,810
example this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you have for</font>

369
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,459
example look at these class names<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

370
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,290
very important we see those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

371
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,959
back just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep track of all those silly</font>

372
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stupid but look here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

373
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">features were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off but as soon as you</font>

374
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,060
turn it on

375
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,240
so now everything's all like it just

376
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,949
enumerates the class names and the

377
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,750
variable names in order of how they're

378
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,370
executed so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're on</font>

379
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,470
say your on class degree relationship

380
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,330
look exploded next and clasp or stupid

381
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:39,100
it's really really easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use I love it</font>

382
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:44,020
all right now we do the actual analysis

383
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:46,510
what time yeah our sample came from our

384
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,789
traffic analysis this was a the original

385
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,908
website with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scarborough critic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at see a</font>

00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:56,200
this game for Brad site so if you check

388
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,789
us out that link by the way I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

389
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,070
references I'll put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> online player</font>

390
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,990
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> will compile it actually leads to a</font>

391
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,820
dump and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in a dump there's like</font>

392
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,059
five or six there's one Annie I test in

393
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,740
at nothing that's world so then that

394
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,990
word<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this particular sample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

402
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,519
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a locker it lost it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

quantity kind of thing right it encrypts

405
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,490
all users files and this one's really

406
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:48,929
good spots open<font color="#E5E5E5"> notepad is like looks</font>

407
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,940
for you so yeah I'd want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't our</font>

408
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,799
analysis of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is based on</font>

409
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,559
how it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the machine so we're just</font>

410
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,309
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a little like that so here</font>

411
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,928
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little Wireshark you filtering on</font>

412
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,970
get requests and you see here the

413
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,620
initial get<font color="#E5E5E5"> request was for the</font>

414
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,019
compromised site so there's scars were

415
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,239
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick and then we have to request</font>

416
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,519
after that and these are both a I test

417
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,990
right here the first one is the flash

418
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,820
file itself because they use the flash

419
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,409
magari direction and the second one

420
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,779
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar the first won't</font>

421
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:20,399
show you exactly how is the HTML page

422
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,409
and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it goes to the</font>

423
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,479
actual landing page if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

424
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,549
this is a swift while this is a call

so here's our little guy here and again

430
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,549
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah test now is your</font>

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,489
connection stuff whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

432
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:47,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and then I have highlighted the</font>

433
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:50,399
actual Swift file edit and here it is

434
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,850
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and Wireshark but that's</font>

435
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,979
boring so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get past that all</font>

436
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,379
right now I really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

437
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,570
full analysis and every line of code how

438
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:02,969
worship of sure his elbow not divert

439
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,408

446
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,700
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did is I basically took out this</font>

447
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,529
is actually screwed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way between</font>

448
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,559
two pairs of you Bob we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

ActionScript use or imply its landed so

450
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,029
you look in here hey what we're doing is

451
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,549
we're calling a function called Go Go

452
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:33,389
calls a function called da da<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stella be</font>

453
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:35,789
right there co da one and passing to

454
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:37,709
asking free that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it generous</font>

455
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:41,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript technically pitos what you're</font>

456
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:43,409
passing into<font color="#CCCCCC"> iris and then there's the</font>

457
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:45,418
URL you're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

458
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:47,009
trace these out traces like a console

459
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,509
log<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this shoe record console right</font>

460
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:51,029
and they get the stuff down here at the

461
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:53,639
bottom and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i compiled it here so we get</font>

462
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:55,499
a javascript function so again flash

465
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,549
the javascript creates a dim called deep

explore do we say that one more time it

469
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,580
checks the client to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

that pseudo random part is created right

490
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,350
here in this for loop and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

threw it a loop that<font color="#CCCCCC"> runs 20 times and</font>

here's an exam

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:34,120

508
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,890
all happening all right now we hit the

509
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,960
landing page yeah so we've just handed

515
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,669
a reason it's in bold up there that we

516
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,659
blocked flash in our environment how

517

many<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block flesh really yeah</font>

519
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,449
so the cool thing about this is here the

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,130
hacking team purpose to came out right

521
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:41,460
when that came out we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had</font>

recording stuff we have attempted thing

523
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,690
nothing happened in this great so we

524
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,190
actually I know it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 emails I think</font>

530
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,820
damn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no patches we kind of</font>

and they just just cut that<font color="#E5E5E5"> crack up</font>

whitelist certain internal uses and such

directly and show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how i extracted</font>

603
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,669
I've stage two so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the part where</font>

607
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:17,920
bunch of code brat but asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so this</font>

608
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolutions horrible that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine alright</font>

609
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:25,900
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compile it in your 80</font>

610
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,860
demo gods don't be a dick oh and pliable

611
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,860
down all right right

612
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:39,039
oh I probably should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have opened a</font>

613
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:39,039
proper project

614
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,929
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't plan it</font>

615
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,840
you read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the screen that's</font>

616
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:50,309
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> buddy that was understand an</font>

617
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,309
accident but I enjoyed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thoroughly</font>

618
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:57,158
alright so here we go we're instantiate

619
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,770
a class name that they had and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

620
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:05,049
we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be a start think dr.</font>

621
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:06,340
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this hey all right</font>

622
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,620
the first thing we do is we fill this

623
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,510
array called<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn an X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what was</font>

624
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:14,080
called X food pissed me off so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

625
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:17,250
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan mix and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan Nexus over here</font>

626
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,289
right there so this array holds some

627
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:22,120
flash-based commands being listening I

628
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:24,190
didn't children to the stage load bikes

629
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,320
they try to obfuscate by just using this

630
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,740
array of referencing index values and in

631
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,820
front and using phrases so we feel that

632
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,860
we do that oh good and over here it's

633
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,178
looking for a stage environment if you

634
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,620
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> staged environment probably</font>

635
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,899
expand you bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> her some type of</font>

636
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,760
working environment so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip the</font>

637
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,699
part where we check through the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

638
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,980
just I just call function so we call

639
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,090
this function called R<font color="#E5E5E5"> and R this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

640
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,860
where it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

641
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,590
sometimes they just give you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

642
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">really freaking obvious names with their</font>

643
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,010
variables like they try to make it so

644
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:00,549
hard to read and then you have prep like

645
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:05,010
embedded additional info and you have

646
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:07,450
you two better and then or c4 key

647
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,860
riverside christian our support oh yeah

648
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,080
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variable name that's</font>

649
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,729
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird so we're loading those in</font>

650
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,280
it this is what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here see how</font>

651
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,200
I

652
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,700
function to array and then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> set a</font>

653
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,860
big long it goes off the screen

654
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:22,820
hexadecimal value we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making our</font>

655
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,800
own byte arrays that's just so once we

656
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,139
do that we then start this guy right

657
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,649
here in bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> landing this will eventually</font>

658
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,210
be a variable that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will contain the</font>

659
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">decoded second stage you can call</font>

660
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,410
spectator technically I'm going to swim

661
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,690
file that's going to load in the memory

662
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,490
so as we scroll down<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those different</font>

663
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,620
for that big list with binary blobs

664
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,120
basically those are all just cat and see

665
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,699
bright lights brake lights of great

666
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,169
whites and blah blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

667
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,010
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip past all that and</font>

668
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:54,200
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call this function and then we</font>

669
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,830
call this function called d and D is

670
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,870
actually a decoder they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deep</font>

671
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:02,270
cute and we pass it and hit look I

672
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,659
didn't write<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0k your best in your</font>

673
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:09,350
RC four key and then your encrypted

674
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:11,000
Swift file and at this point now it's

675
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,189
decrypted that's what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is</font>

676
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,050
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bike</font>

677
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">array to a string and we're going to</font>

678
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,159
call it stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 i justwe just want to</font>

679
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,780
call it so we do that and then now we're

680
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,520
going to trace it so tracing it again

681
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,350
just being writing it out to the console

682
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:29,360
so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I step over this down here</font>

683
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stage two bottle we want so</font>

684
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I basically just pop that into an X file</font>

685
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,110
and then 930 now you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice it down</font>

686
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,590
here what it does it actually creates a

687
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,540
loader flash motor and then a loader

688
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,280
records object and then just

689
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,780
you don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and then what it</font>

690
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,030
does is actually being sneaky little

691
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">chump right here see this function help</font>

692
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,580
him not only does it decode the second

693
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Swift in the memory but then it passes a</font>

694
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,310
biker a to a specific function in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

695
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,570
second Swift<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob the purpose of that is</font>

696
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,820
multifold actually but one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gopher</font>

697
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,530
like trying to stop diameter spanic

698
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,810
analysis is if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that</font>

699
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,550
and you simply extracted stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

700
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:11,490
try to run it it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like where's</font>

701
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:14,070
my parameter like 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters run it</font>

702
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,870
so it's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> D obligation of tip it</font>

703
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">also makes something to reuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

704
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,050
stage container and just push into a

705
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,830
raised into it so they can quickly

706
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:26,370
weaponize<font color="#E5E5E5"> boo crap and push now I'm sure</font>

707
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,199
it's for other things too but then so as

708
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:31,860
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we pull that guy out I popped it</font>

709
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,500
up on buyers total and had a texture

710
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,360
ratio of 12 out of 54 and this was a

711
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,020
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty first</font>

712
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">five so stage two parties did that</font>

713
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,540
gluten on stage two is is things like

714
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,280
step away from the obfuscation and

715
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,570
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh hell I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

716
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,060
this we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to name everything</font>

717
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:54,230
like exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so there's some</font>

718
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,840
binary binary data logs

719
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,340
and they're literally label like aw 22

720
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,080
because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> underscore swept right</font>

721
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,360
here see that they're telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

722
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">a swift well for an exploit next one</font>

723
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">last one this is a vbscript displayed f1</font>

724
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:13,459
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you so doing analysis</font>

725
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,830
on one of these exploits identify item

726
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,590
that damn thing it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified as Cee</font>

727
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,120
2015 8650 one this is the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

728
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,040
really pisses<font color="#CCCCCC"> me off in this talk</font>

729
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,709
because I wish I had time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to personally</font>

730
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,510
rip all fly of these apart and find out

731
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,880
exactly to ensure they are the

732
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,669
properties and I wanted it to be at a

733
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,890
time did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change from angry</font>

734
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,299
Danny so this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD this will</font>

735
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,890
apply our souls that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was so look this</font>

736
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,780
is what it is it just integer overflow

737
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,220
if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar the integer</font>

738
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,780
overflow essentially if you have a

739
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,429
bucket where you can store a certain

740
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,139
amount of contents you filled up you

741
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,090
over blow it you start overflowing your

742
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,530
data in the place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not resign</font>

743
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,299
so where you can probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the</font>

744
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,490
instruction pointer to point to and then

745
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:57,590
you can get remote code execution and as

746
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:58,669
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at top ah let's go up it's go</font>

747
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,449
collapse we're gonna take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at this</font>

748
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:01,450
page to file now

749
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,900
go to 35

750
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,559
all right hey how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people here ever</font>

751
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,789
debug she'll go before your library man

752
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:20,330
your hands first you want to help you

753
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:20,330
out there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just screwed yourself bro</font>

754
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:35,190
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never would all right we go</font>

755
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,780
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the flash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with overload stage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

756
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to penn run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

757
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,570
the code so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering what's</font>

758
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,760
going on from this point toward now we

759
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,770
have staged to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extract it out right and</font>

760
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,120
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have also have the binary data that</font>

761
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,889
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pushed into it so we're</font>

762
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,539
going to mainly just show that crap in

763
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn running and I'm going to debug</font>

764
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:52,710
through it show you exactly how it works

765
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,840
eventually once it creates these five

766
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,909
exploits we picked one I grabbed one of

767
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,129
them and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed that one looking on</font>

768
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,390
time deeply analyzed it so i'm going to

769
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you the shellcode we're going to</font>

770
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,929
walk you

771
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:19,650
ocean neatly screw that guy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

772
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:24,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> serve it neck neck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I still use beta</font>

773
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:25,730
yeah Ned oh there is going to burn

774
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,050
actually having debug the shellcode

775
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,270
everybody see the show code does it's

776
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,430
really weird I don't know why they do it

777
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">gilson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so here we go we have</font>

778
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,109
stage and we want me to do here we're

779
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:42,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the proper file before</font>

780
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:42,680
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want a scoop again stage 2 and</font>

781
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:51,270
make ok so I'm stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 we are using get</font>

782
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,040
it girl and we're passing the array that

783
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I extracted are the previous silliness</font>

784
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,639
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm function so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

785
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that's supposed to be hitting like</font>

786
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,430
how you're supposed to know is there

787
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,799
right we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pop it in there and</font>

788
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,129
what that's going to do first<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

789
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,130
compiling

790
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:17,450
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can ignore that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your type</font>

791
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:19,130
declaration<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so as soon as we start</font>

792
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,790
debugging we see that we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

793
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,390
method<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3et gets called or hear that runs</font>

794
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,940
method 3 go in here sorry where were you

795
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:33,859
first off zipper this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my way</font>

796
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:35,270
that's my way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay first thing</font>

797
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,520
we do is we're going to call method six

798
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,650
but six is going to create a variable

799
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,509
with strings to enumerate the client

800
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,430
meeting it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

801
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,200
what she is running on browsers running

802
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,919
all of the fun stuff right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

803
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,919
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how to do that</font>

804
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,600
there we go so

805
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,069
members there you go so what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

806
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,230
is they use the combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

807
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,630
things number one is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses an external</font>

808
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,750
interface called image move external

809
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,310
integrates from actionscript they tries

810
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,920
to grab the containers in the engine is

811
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,930
actually processing your client site

812
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,970
browser scripting meaning it runs

813
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript markets so we're going to run</font>

814
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,859
JavaScript and some of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

815
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:22,560
does stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this window dot</font>

816
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,180
navigator<font color="#E5E5E5"> acne simple as that regular</font>

817
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,730
JavaScript commands and pulls the

818
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:30,118
results back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in another thing it uses it</font>

819
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,160
uses action scripts capabilities feature

820
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,720
which I just found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font>

821
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,310
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> within flash with an</font>

822
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,618
actionscript 3 itself you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> enumerate</font>

823
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,990
was running on such<font color="#E5E5E5"> abusing capabilities</font>

824
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">flavor okay so it's going to grab if</font>

825
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,290
there's a debugger president the

826
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,640
resolution of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen it's all the</font>

827
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,110
cracks we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to step past</font>

828
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,109
this and take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> results</font>

829
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,710
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of asking</font>

830
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,819
now you

831
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,470
and r 1 so here's the results of

832

processing that screen resolutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk away alright guys are</font>

844
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,910
going to call function at eight and our

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,910
method 80

846
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,709
I should throw a key cool story<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">right so here we're gonna fill up this</font>

848
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:55,330

<font color="#E5E5E5">the secondary swear it was extracted out</font>

853
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,030
what was in that well it just got

854
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:09,160
decoded and what was in it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

855
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">over here there's a list of links these</font>

858
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,950
they let you just came from you're not a

862
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,299
does if it finds out that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to</font>

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,220
run next<font color="#CCCCCC"> play it hits back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much sandwich works best in</font>

866
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,680
what environments<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bitch me Ernest I</font>

867
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,300
think that's what it's worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

868
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,460
here they actually give us hope they can

869
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,750
call it key for the payload there's our

870
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,290
decryption key for the malware it's

871
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,310
gonna download later<font color="#CCCCCC"> how cool thanks</font>

872
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,400
good if I'm scared that a little more

873
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,089
clever and then here are the actual

874
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,480
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run these</font>

875
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:51,940
particular vulnerabilities so three

876
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,599
swift are flash-based vulnerabilities

877
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,120
and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ie vbscript based execution</font>

878
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,540
changes

879
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:03,609
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit ok so we jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a pass</font>

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paris not hitting at six</font>

881
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,308
yep

882
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright remember to call method 10 I</font>

883

don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell it does here's</font>

884
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:16,910
what it does help now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to</font>

885
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,130
see if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client is actually inside of</font>

886
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,720
a non-standard like browser type of

887
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:23,750
environment looking to see if we're

running phantom<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodejs couch j/s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rhino</font>

spider monkey javascript engine which

891
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:33,319
runs in like Mozilla Firefox and then

892
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,599
also a for energy butter so right now

893
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,038
this is part of checking to see like

894
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,380
should I run<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now or should I like</font>

895
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,589
back off look we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either with</font>

896
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,670
a porcelain<font color="#CCCCCC"> say hat neither could and</font>

897
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:46,640
then we're going to private<font color="#E5E5E5"> event at</font>

898
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:49,150
eleven method 11 is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing back and</font>

899
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,950
all this does is it creates an image

900
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,510
location in that image location is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

just trying to access it and all it does

903
00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:00,519
that tells them like so far so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

904
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,519
what it's doing pretty simple stuff

905
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,380
surprise me enough at this point right

906
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,299
here it does not provide an identifier

907
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,480
it just blows<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standard source and</font>

908
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,580
gives the link for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jas pink so later on</font>

909
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,790
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you enter the question I'm</font>

910
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,790
sorry

911
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:31,500
my plan is all

912
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:42,780
okay so screw all right here there does

913
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:48,120
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I absolutely can use pockets</font>

914
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:52,460
pushes yeah okay so skip next slow stuff

915
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:54,960
over there<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that exploits in a row</font>

916
00:40:52,460 --> 00:41:00,750
like the spitting on fans big shot now

917
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,040
we have come from again yeah by two

918
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,350
different TV script and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had</font>

919
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,270
three different flash exploits these are

920
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,610
separate flash files that are 12 being

921
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:12,240
loaded into memory right so let's go

922
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,560
take a look one I pulled that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 the</font>

923
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,569
one that I pulled out was this one or

924
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,549
the one that excuse when I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

925
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen right here now what I extracted</font>

926
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:22,890
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially how preparing the entire</font>

927
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,630
life so what does actually first up I

928
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,790
popped at the buyers total this morning

929
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,140
actually I forgot that blows buyers to

930
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,180
look I should upload the buyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

931
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,830
when I did it only had five hundred

932
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,290
fifty four hits and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually what</font>

933
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:36,060
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> tells me it was potentially this</font>

934
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular CD the signature which I</font>

935
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fully trust but based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

936
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,710
actual chain that I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

937
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you it doesn't look an integer overflow</font>

938
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:45,990
I just couldn't confirm it time so but

939
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,330
notice it actually associated with rig

940
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,890
see these will go right there rig is one

941
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,630
of them popular excellent kids right now

942
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,009
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as popular as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> padrino but it's</font>

943
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,310
probably number 20 studio right now

944
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,930
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much so what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that little guy</font>

945
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,370
you will essentially it loads up some

946
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,710
shellcode you guys where are the kinds

947
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:04,450
of

948
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,980
go if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fighting game show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

949
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,960

950
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to change the instruction</font>

951
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,950
pointer and cpu which is what tells the

952
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpu what it's about to run or actually</font>

953
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,310
execute you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to overwrite that</font>

954
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,680
at the beginning of your personal code

955
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">so once you can obtain that the cpu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

from usually a misuse to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop Michelle</font>

959
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:27,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to reverse shell so that I</font>

00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,200
can maintain access to your get access

961
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,369
to your system i should say so we're

962
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some shell code</font>

963
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,030
the show code that it actually loads in

964
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,280
this slip file does a couple things it

965
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,800
finds itself in memory require<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show</font>

966
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,080
you why it exits the rest of itself to

967
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,270
prevent static analysis and then it

968
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,220
actually creates our causal process

969
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,310
create page with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anson version of</font>

970
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,990
the cross this creation of the library

971
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,270
so your static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis of the shellcode</font>

972
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:55,149
the problem we have is down here Cearley

973
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:57,759
analysis fails down here well let's go

974
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:00,970
see right here see that nine a value

975
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,119
that's a single by X or key that's going

976
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,580
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to loop 596 time</font>

977
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,650
are hex decimal times and as it

978
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,779
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decode itself so static</font>

979
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,640
analysis fails black because it's not

980
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,640
xorg so we're out there live analysis

981
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:26,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright the dead you're making it clear</font>

982
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,049
i hope your<font color="#CCCCCC"> indiegogo</font>

983
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:38,288
okay i bought the show good to an

00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,439
executable take the executable and drop

985
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:42,940
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holly debug two and a ladybug</font>

986
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,470
right what you're going to do is you're

987
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,369
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to be pressing one</font>

988
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:49,890
of the f keys when I tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you okay</font>

989
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:51,240
all right now the first thing we're

990
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:54,390
doing here is the show food is actually

991
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,919
going to jump down itself so you'll

992
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">notice here it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump short so</font>

993
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,410
go ahead SF so now we just jump over

994
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,089
here to judge this very location this

995
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,640
very location that was going to call

996
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:12,230
back up here so why the hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it going</font>

997
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:17,029
to do that anyway no I what's up

998
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,590
yeah so when you do a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah when</font>

999
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,090
you do a call and assembly language

1000
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,859
you're doing two things you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing</font>

1001
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,720
the next construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> location on the</font>

1002
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:25,640
stack just probably be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working variable</font>

1003
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,919
zones just consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right now and</font>

1004
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,629
maybe make a jump now the reason we're

1005
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,059
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but why do you want to have</font>

1006
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:38,939
that edge on stack for some clever for

1007
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:41,009
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now oh we're going to</font>

1008
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:43,078
my location so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an address</font>

1009
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:46,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">space layout randomization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows with</font>

1010
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,400

1011
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,869
cute and even when you're trying to

1012
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,309
exploit something you have no idea where

1013
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,559
you're actually going to land in memory

1014
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:54,930
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing this is finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out where</font>

1015
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,559
it exists yeah so go ahead s7 it look

1016
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:01,109
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here boom do that now we have the</font>

1017
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:04,019
valuable we reside now all right going

1018
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to hit f7 we're gonna pop it so now eax</font>

1019
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,129
up here contains our location so we know

1020
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,140
where we are all right yes em again

1021
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,059

1022
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,038
counter register so now we're going to

1023
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:17,039
basically start to counting we're going

1024

hatches going at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sm and then we're going</font>

1026
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:24,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start our loop this starts the loop</font>

1032
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,490
we're pointing to this location over

1033
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,960
here follow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> um memory address so</font>

1034
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:45,080
right down here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk our necks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1066
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,649
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> grew to we find kernel32 we can</font>

1067
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,480
identify the functions that live inside

1068
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,410
colonel grew<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can call it</font>

1075
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,000
to load the functions that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1076
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:46,520
inside kernel32 so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

1087
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:18,350
street has right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and compare it to</font>

1088
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">these this value here and then it</font>

1089
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,490
defines that part it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare</font>

1090
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the next value here so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1091
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,850
basically what it's looking for we have

1092
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,710
the values of what is looking for so

1093
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,440
when we decode that like save you just

1094
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:35,080
pop that into Python it comes out as

1095

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for carers and Eric's ass yeah</font>

1099
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,860
so it's actually backwards so we're

1100
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:52,370
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something to spur to create</font>

1101
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:59,560
an instance of a which is create process

1102

1130
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,060
like URL download or something but

1131
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,339
