00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,170
security that's my real name Craig

Cunningham I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an IT generalist</font>

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,770
I've been around this area for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long</font>

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">time i programmed a motorola 68000</font>

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,870
similar language cobol in high school

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,329
that gives me an idea how old I am I'm

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,769
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a security ninja and</font>

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,629
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might have come to see a</font>

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,030
screen ninja but I know the fundamentals

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,199
pretty well and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> words if I need to</font>

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">get something done I can generally find</font>

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,750
the tool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the work done so when I</font>

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,940
really made this talk I said well I'm

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,190
going to talk about how to protect

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and then I said well I have a</font>

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,559
25 minute slot that's not going to work

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,810
and so I worked on and I worked on it i

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,429
finally realized nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could tell</font>

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you from a technical standpoint could</font>

29
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,900
fully protect you but from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a legal</font>

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,539
standpoint for a moral argument

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint maybe we can reframe the</font>

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,590
argument so we don't have to protect

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,179
ourselves so much and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what my</font>

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,040
talk is I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can prove that to</font>

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out</font>

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they talk to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they say hey</font>

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give up a little your</font>

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,009
privacy for security it's a zero-sum

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
game you know that's the claim they also

40
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,590
claim you know the government's here to

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,579
help you you know that's the class of

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,930
thing that you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trouble</font>

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,000
when someone says all we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to help</font>

44
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,119
you or the police you're like I'll shit

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,909
on that things have gone sideways now so

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,700
my comment related to this is this right

47
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,159
here everything above the<font color="#E5E5E5"> headline is</font>

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,380
absolute bullshit in other words

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,420
security can't exist without privacy

50
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,360
because privacy is part of security if

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,520
you take any low level cert you know

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,469
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus the first thing they do is</font>

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,479
introduce you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the CIA triangle and</font>

54
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,119
they say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's confidentiality</font>

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrity availability but when you take</font>

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
my privacy way you destroy

57
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,940
confidentiality when you put malware

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,000
my systems and destroy my process

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,220
integrity you destroy that in the eye

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,349
availability I'm willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bet there's</font>

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,230
a chance that if the fiber splitters in

62
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,030
the AT&T room dropped out they tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATT</font>

63
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,738
you need to stop this circuit for a

64
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,910
while until we can install some new

65
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,510
cards because we need to monitor

66
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:36,500
everything and words availability can be

67
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,140
impacted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> people trying to spy on you</font>

68
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so if you were wise rabbit one</font>

69
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,559
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you do is you turn</font>

70
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,079
bluetooth off you turn location services

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,420
off I saw a guy yesterday in to talk and

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,000
he said I have seven laptops with me and

73
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,069
a raspberry pi he said I wipe one

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,959
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> after each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day and I download</font>

75
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,940
only the data to like some kind of sim

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,349
card to his raspberry<font color="#CCCCCC"> PI's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like as long</font>

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,720
as they don't find the Raspberry Pi I

78
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,548
think I'm good and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like man that's</font>

87
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,358
power where they be nation-states

88
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,639
hackers they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal your</font>

91
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,500
security does these things you know the

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,519
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a hacked pc the value of a</font>

there and you should know it during<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

95
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,709
saw some of them television last night

96
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,359
and it changed my thought on this talk

97
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,430
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it was about the st.</font>

98
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,829
Valentine's Day Massacre and what that

99
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">was is they went in and dressed its</font>

100
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,950
police officers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these gang</font>

101
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,329
members and they got into line up

102
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,280
against the wall and then they killed

103
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,630
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> up well with those guys have lined</font>

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,389
up against the wall if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competing</font>

105
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,459
gang had come in hell no they were

106
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,019
taught you have to respond this way to

107
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,329
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when the government</font>

108
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,370
accost you and tells you to give up all

109
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,829
your weapons and stand against the wall

110
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,630
you do so because otherwise it's going

111
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,450
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more trouble for you well in that</font>

112
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">case they all end up dead because they</font>

113
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,899
made no effort to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves</font>

114
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,340
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the assumption like in V</font>

115
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,489
for Vendetta you know the finger men

116
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,890
pull her aside you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know she has no power</font>

117
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:27,130
they have total power therefore they

118
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,810
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to abuse it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say I</font>

119
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,670
the rabbit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I start using some</font>

120
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,790
anonymization tools to protect my data

121
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:37,090
from being captured well I get on a

122
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,590
special list this guy uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour this guy</font>

123
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,060
uses VPN he encrypts data in 2013<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

124
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,710
traveled across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Canadian border and</font>

125
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,320
I looked up all the restrictions that

126
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,020
might relate to me well one of them said

127
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,849
on the US side of customs if you have

128
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,620
any encrypted data the US government has

129
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right to make a copy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and keep</font>

130
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,900
it forever I think they modify that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

131
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">five years recently but forever their</font>

132
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,409
philosophy was if you've encrypted it

133
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,960
it's suspicious and we should keep a

134
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,640
copy of it because it's private to me

135
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,159
doesn't mean it should be suspicious to

136
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,099
my government but we've got lots of

137
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,300
government programs Bull<font color="#CCCCCC"> Run that's all</font>

138
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,790

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,870
gather all data possible he scored you

142
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,900
know Snowden talks about Keith score he

says our xkeyscore he says look I can

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,589
heated discussions and one day

238
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,300
asked me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stupid question and I kind</font>

didn't ask me any more questions or

248
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,120
making other arguments during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exact</font>

250
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,650
he'd backed me in the corner because he

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,530
has learned to define the conversation

252

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we enter the conversation is</font>

253

clapper recently was accused of saying

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,530
some incorrect things in court I mean

255
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,050
Brent Congress which he did and he said

256
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,250
well it was a loaded question it was

257
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,010
like saying when are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quit</font>

258
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,210
beating your wife well they do that the

259
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,550
government does that to us all the time

260
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,860
they called Munich they called

261
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,770
encryption ammunition so that all the

262
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">laws relating to encryption would relate</font>

263
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,010
to that they threw Phil Zimmerman in

264
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,740
jail because he wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give him the</font>

265
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,900
back door when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote PGP they said</font>

266
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,370
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the back door give us the back</font>

267
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,740
door key and he said there is none and

268
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,810
they couldn't fathom that and then words

269
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,980
they're like new1 rights encryption

270
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,810
without giving themselves a back door

271
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,850
he's like no really there's no back door

272
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,099
they said well you will put out an

273
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,140
update and you will put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a back door in</font>

274
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,820
the update and he said no and they said

275
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">well we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this really comfy prison</font>

the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we have done I</font>

faint strengths they geo locate you off

308

those three wifis they know exactly

where you are and we're given that data

310
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,520
out now the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> claims if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a relationship for you to come</font>

as a third party and say we deserve the

00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:00,270
right to all that data is again my

321

second slide bullshit<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so then</font>

329
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,160
want intimacy we want tightness we want

330
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,490
friendship we want our friends to know

331
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,900
more about us that anyone else knows we

332
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,720
want to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable that if I make</font>

333
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,480
an inside joke my friend gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and no</font>

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,790
with that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we move up</font>

336
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,680
the chain let's say if we haven't

337
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,170
recognized that our friendship intimacy

338
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,680
family is messed up celestine personal

339
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,880
worth social recognition accomplishments

340
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
well the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> says what we need to</font>

341
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about that too what were you</font>

342
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,459
saying it social recognition you're a

343
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,230
member of b-sides Oh eff that's some

344
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,420
sketchy organizations you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

345
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,250
to put you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a special list most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

346
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,770
don't make it probably to this level for

347
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,810
the most part I admit if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it if</font>

348
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look up here it says once you get to</font>

349
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,989
that level you don't care too much about

350
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,880
the opinion of others maybe that would

351
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,160
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> us friendlier just people spying on</font>

352
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,220
our privacy I'm probably somewhere in

353
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,280
here and figure that I need my alcohol

354
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:25,740
from up there

355
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:29,310
alright so back in 1700s<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1800s bentham</font>

356
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,490
here he designed to prison people say a

357
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,069
pen opticon or pan optimism and they're

358
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,110
saying the whole design<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this prison</font>

359
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,730
is that one guard would stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

360
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,890
behind like mirrored glass or something

361
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,750
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no one would know when he or</font>

362
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,120
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking out and all the</font>

363
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,190
prisoners would be here so every

364
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,560
prisoner would say I say I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

365
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,350
being watched but I could be being

366
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,030
watched right now therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will alter</font>

367
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,810
you know what I do that was the whole

368
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:59,550
idea of this he said a new mode of

369
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,810
obtaining power of the mind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mind</font>

370
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,449
over the mind and quantity here Jerry

371
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,729
without example he's claiming this as a

372
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,560
better idea to manipulate people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

373
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,770
minds than has ever been around before

374
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,260
well this was a prison this was for

375
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,319
milling grinding people down mentally

376
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,330
and we are asked to accept that the NSA

377
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,480
will take our data and watch us at all

378
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,370
times well this right here a short

379
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
review for decoration most of you

380
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,060
probably already<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew this if you read</font>

381
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Glenn Greenwald's book stuff like this</font>

382
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,439
but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know about this the</font>

383
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,670
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy who designed this prison when</font>

384
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,500
we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Declaration of</font>

385
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,800
Independence he wrote a short review

386
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,360
mocking it mocking the view of our style

387

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,300
know had a reasonable say in other words

391
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,449
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a guy who was so against our way</font>

of life you know he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an elite elite</font>

396
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,060
of that meaning if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you watch something</font>

397
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,469
you change it technically it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,480
might scream of me if I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put find</font>

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,070
that out but we say if we look at a

401
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,070
system we change it quantum cryptography

402
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:17,490
works this way if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pass data from at</font>

from Alice to Bob and anyone intercepts

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,970
it evilly it even looks at those photons

405
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,800
we can tell so we can tell if someone

406
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,960
looked at something we are using this

407

<font color="#E5E5E5">type of quantum computing that we know</font>

getting all these tips and they were

the defense lawyer now has a false story

which to glom onto and make his defense

or her defense and so they're living off

great and one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> something sets your</font>

00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:55,769
ass on fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've assumed that the</font>

574
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:56,998
government is keeping you safe you've

575
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:59,179
assumed that surveillance will

576
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:04,319
negatively never negatively affect you

577
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:06,329
the Hindenburg<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle alright so the</font>

578
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,949
next argument that always comes up is if

579
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:09,149
I don't have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide I don't</font>

580
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:11,489
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about government</font>

581
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,590
surveillance I have not found the rock

582
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:15,120
solid argument

583
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,830
for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found many good arguments</font>

584
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,270
against it but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the rock</font>

585
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,299
solid I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy did a really</font>

586
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:24,210
good job Terry Adams he's saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

587
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,220
our state was developed everything in

588
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,260
government was supposed to be public and

589
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,120
everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lives was supposed to</font>

590
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,279
be private we even have these terms

591
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,600
public meetings private meetings well

592
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,190
now what is the government telling us

593
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,428
they're telling it this should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

594
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,740
opposite how how many decades in the

595
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:42,600
future will it be before you get someone

596
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pre appointed to the Supreme Court</font>

597
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they wear a mask like a SWAT team</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's an extreme example to get you to</font>

601
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,658
think about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to resist you</font>

602
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,370
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look up who's on the FISA</font>

603
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,029
Court you just can't look up much else

604
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,529
about the FISA Court all right

605
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:03,899
everything's got something to hide this

606
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,580
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very famous statement by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

607
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,139
very corrupt man because you couldn't

608
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,178
really become a head honcho at that time

609
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,490
without being a very corrupt man in with

610
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:14,100
the system but the importance of this

611
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,470
statement about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the six lines is not</font>

612
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,990
that he had the intelligence to find

613
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,730
something bad it's he knew the courts

614
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,649
were corrupt enough that if he accused

615
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:27,179
you of something bad you'd be found

616
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:30,479
guilty of it this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sorry this</font>

617
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:34,409
is a combination of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system not</font>

618
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,299
necessarily up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

619
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Supreme Court justice I'm running out of</font>

620
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:40,490
time here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm going to rush this a</font>

621
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:42,960
little bit basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same article</font>

622
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,940
bright they referenced a federal law

623
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,320
about size of lobster tails<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said do</font>

624
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,850
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could be arrested for</font>

625
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a lobster tail under certain size</font>

626
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,480
so it doesn't matter whether you bought

627
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,220
it in a supermarket whether it served to

628
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,230
you in a restaurant whether you found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

629
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,470
alive or dead whether you killed it in

630
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,230
self-defense my favorite part but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

631
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accused of a federal crime this</font>

632
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,250
is a Supreme Court justice the United

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,189
States warning us that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law is too</font>

634
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:11,520
damn confusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right when the wall</font>

635
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:13,049
came down there were potentially up to

636
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,480
like five hundred thousands about the

637
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:18,120
top number of informants in<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Germany</font>

638
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,590
and they said we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this data from</font>

639
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,969
all these informants what do we do with

640
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,620
it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people said let's open up</font>

641
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,840
the data and just let everyone know

642
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,459
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were like should the</font>

643
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,360
data be open or closed and I thought

644
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,130
this guy said some

645
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,199
kind of funny and I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

646
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys there's only two innocent</font>

647
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,470
groups the newborn and the alcoholic and

648
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but they just</font>

649
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,530
decided to keep those files closed

650
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,510
because they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be a</font>

651
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,129
travesty there would be reprisals there

652
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,230
would be problems there would be people

653
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,760
who cheat on their wives and and all

654
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information would hit their society</font>

655
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,860
at once and it would potentially destroy

656
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,150
their society Big Brother Big Data i

657
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,740
found this through an article about

658
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,140
Snowden<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the guys from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yale should</font>

659
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,330
really get a credit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they said</font>

660
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,360
basically every time Moore's law helps

661
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:07,199
us double our our power our computing

662
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,290
power get cheaper are our civil rights

663
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,299
will be violated and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time we</font>

664
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,270
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reevaluate what controls we have</font>

665
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,160
in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that our civil</font>

rights are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not being violated by that</font>

667
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,040
increase in technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

668
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,799
getting to the opaque anonymous attempts

669
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,379
to be very opaque forces that might help

670
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:33,780
us but we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what else is</font>

671
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:36,030
opaque almost to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> is FISA Court I am</font>

672
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,309
NOT suicidal just for the reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

673
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:43,049
anyone knows like put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out there I</font>

674
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,330
mentioned in another talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to this</font>

675
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:47,280
week I said hey if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> went around</font>

676
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:49,020
talking like Thomas Jefferson they'd

677
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,799
lock you up you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on the</font>

678
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,750
list well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the stamp from his his</font>

679
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,940
statement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the full statement</font>

680
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,220
and that's on the memorial I mean this

681
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not something that I didn't verify he</font>

682
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:06,120
said they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tyron see</font>

683
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,710
what do we have we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tyron see we</font>

684
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability for the government to</font>

685
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,970
come in put malware wherever the hell

686
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:17,159
they want and watch you here's the

687
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">soldier in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my house all right in if you</font>

688
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,919
haven't read this book it's an

689
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,629
interesting book it's an old book so

690
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,700
it's not up on technology but it's

691
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,960
interesting book and in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

692
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,760
convicted this guy of stealing

693
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,990
electricity years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago when</font>

694
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,160
hackers have got busted for breaking

695
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,200
into banks they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them</font>

696
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,370
guilty on any of the laws currently they

697
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,530
would bust him for stealing electricity

698
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,760
I think if they can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

699
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,428
should be able to bust the feds for

700
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,830
putting malware on the system alright

701
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:44,490
here's our our group clap

702
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">sir keith and there i refer to this as</font>

703
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:50,760
engrish because they tend to define

704
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:54,059
words differently we do they have the

705
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,039
word collection which means whatever we

706
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,960
keep we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really collect only when</font>

707
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,179
we read it did we collect it that's

708
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,340
their terminology the government is

709
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,529
allowing themselves to redefine our

710
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,600
language so they can do whatever the

711
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">hell they want they can justify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

712

court if we let them re-engineer the
