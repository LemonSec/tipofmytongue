00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm a researcher I do automotive

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,600
research I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it now for 23</font>

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,130
years I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hacker per se I'd have</font>

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,330
to scream now thanks go better but about

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years ago we started seeing</font>

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,198
some problems and I basically made a

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,629
career out of making things<font color="#E5E5E5"> do stuff</font>

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,130
they weren't supposed to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,320
we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in cars so we</font>

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,000
needed sudden acceleration happen well I

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,800
was the guy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that happen needed</font>

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,750
a VCR to record automatically probably

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,480
don't you don't know what a VCR is but

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,579
uh yeah we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make</font>

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,860
that VCR happened when the car start to

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,600
start recording so throughout this I've

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,120
made a career of doing that and now at

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,730
this age of computers used to use canned

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,769
buses networks v2v and all the

26
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,050
interconnectivity it became a real

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,270
priority for agency to make sure these

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">things do not happen in the future so</font>

29
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,689
that's just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about my</font>

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,659
background electronics engineer all

31
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,610
right Sasha hi I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sasha's del n I'm</font>

with exxon mobil corporation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

33
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,689
primarily involved in application

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,259
security software security but in a

35
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,000
broader sense cyber security as well I i

36
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,369
represent a portfolio of several

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,259
thousand applications and have a real

38
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,640
passion for securing things like ERP

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,560
systems I don't think they get enough

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,790
attention and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mainstream</font>

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,380
community think we spent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time</font>

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,270
talking about web apps and e-commerce

43
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,070
apps and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that's pretty</font>

44
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,500
easy it down in front but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

45
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,329
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things where corporations store</font>

46
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,040
their most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that</font>

47
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,350
makes the business run things that store

you know financial information crown

49
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,360
jewels things that run very proprietary

50
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:51,899
optimization models so I have a big

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,439
passion<font color="#E5E5E5"> for securing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gariepy systems and</font>

development life cycle for those

64
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:39,530
products prior to that I also was the

65
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:42,230
security officer at medtronic so I have

66
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:46,160
had experiences with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all of</font>

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,220
the faces that the Karen just showed and

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,390
worked directly with with Barnaby Jack

69
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:57,049
as well as reporting from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay Radcliffe</font>

70
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:00,319
from those product areas dealt with

Scott<font color="#CCCCCC"> irving's and you you name it I'm</font>

72
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,179
so I'll talk a little bit about some of

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">those experiences and alignment with</font>

74
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,640
with security researchers and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,549
philosophy and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steps in</font>

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
that evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so actually why</font>

77
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,450
don't we start there since since

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,389
Nickerson's not maybe going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join us</font>

79
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right ah what have been your</font>

80
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:24,440
experiences with researchers and

81
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,130
particularly not just at an appointed

82
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,600
time snapshot but broadly throughout the

83
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">last few years have you been dealing</font>

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,930
with products and researchers so it's um

85
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:41,810
it it's been a real I guess interesting

86
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:46,100
ride or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a roller coaster</font>

87
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,950
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate enough that when</font>

88
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,769
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> researchers have</font>

89
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,560
approached the the corporations that

90
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,560
I've been with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically get your</font>

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,060
you know initial you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god</font>

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,120
what's what's happening what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

93
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,280
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and there's usually not the</font>

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,560
right point of interface and the

95
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">connections and so they get the</font>

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,190
runaround which becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very you know</font>

97
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:15,270
frustrating type of

98
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,149
of a scenario they also get you know as

99
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,910
much as they can with the legal in the

100
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,890
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communications side they</font>

101
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,470
probably you know have been given the

102
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,229
old Heisman<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in terms of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

103
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,940
stiff arm and as much that that that can

104
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:35,010
be done and so I tell organizations you

105
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,670
know that's the very first worst thing

106
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:42,960
that you can do if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

107
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:47,160
recipe for disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> do those types of</font>

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,950
activities but it sometimes takes that

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,530
that crash are burned for people to

110
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,150
really get the appropriate understanding

111
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,489
and for you know you to get the

112
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,969
movements that you you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in</font>

113
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,980
place so that evolution at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

114
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,010
organizations that I've been involved

115
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,820
and currently or at you have to have an

116
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-door particular you know policy and</font>

117
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,440
positioning that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be communicated</font>

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,000
and understood at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of the</font>

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,730
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at a level where i get</font>

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,310
that appropriate visibility and I get

121
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that communications so that there is</font>

122
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,240
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better understanding as part of our</font>

123
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">evolution they know where to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come you</font>

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,580
know there's one spot that comes in the

125
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,770
door I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a team that's a line to</font>

126
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,370
manage you know that level of

127
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,859
communication any researchers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

128
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,840
in through that door effectively they

129
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,180
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a response and a communications</font>

130
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,419
directly back from me it's not pawned

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,630
off it's not you know gear to someone

132
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,370
else it's my job in my team's jobs to

133
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,219
find out which sets of products or

134
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,530
solutions that this is involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

135
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,440
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do the appropriate analysis</font>

136
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,380
jointly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in validating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that information</font>

137
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,870
you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the researcher and from</font>

138
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,460
that research community so once we have

139
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,730
that dialogue and an awareness going and

140
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization understands that then</font>

141
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,390
you can manage things a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

142
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,620
effectively and that's what we've seen

143
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:29,010
to you know at least our experiences

144
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:32,400
the floodgates have<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know opened</font>

145
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:35,940
you know over you know swapping because

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,789
we have you know an open program it's

147
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,750
been publicly communicated at least when

148
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:46,200
it Phillips when I launched it in

149
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:49,200
November of 2014 and the reactions that

150
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,890
we've had in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

151
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,159
research worked with and dealt directly

152
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:59,760
with our baby monitors so you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stanislaus and rapid seven you</font>

154
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,460
know we jointly had the conversations it

155
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,590
was a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Phillips wasn't even</font>

156
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,979
manufacturing and maintaining but it had

157
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:12,780
our brand and our recognition on it so I

158
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,900
followed it through to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

159
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,239
had appropriate patching and and it was

160
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,030
updated just as if it was still Phillips

161
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,790
with the Gibson innovations which was

162
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,450
care feeding for that last year we've

163
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked with and the other part of my</font>

164
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,250
evolution is once you start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

165
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,350
that the researchers you then also want

166
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,660
to build in that is a part of your

167
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall program so majority of the</font>

168
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,440
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with or that</font>

169
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,770
have brought you know at least in the

170
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,740
medical device for our products issues

171
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,419
to us we've been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring them in</font>

172
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,780
as a part of either my training or

173
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,910
awareness so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of the researchers</font>

174
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,340
when I bring my product security team

175
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and my development arms together they</font>

176
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,190
also have come in and spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

177
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,470
teams and been able to enlight them on

178
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,870
that handshake and how to work together

179
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know from a cooperative perspective</font>

180
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,720
so that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a key you know</font>

181
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,349
learning gum factor we've also leverage

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,980
them in additional either verification

183
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,750
or other testing in terms of with some

184
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,230
of their passions are as a part of our

185
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:28,140
development processes so again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

186
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,440
if it's done correctly for those

187
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,210
organizations that do want to have have

188
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,539
a passion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in our particular case</font>

189
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,140
yeah I this is about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very first</font>

190
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,809
slide or anything now

191
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,240
talk about at least a majority of our

192
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:47,010
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I deal with with patient and</font>

193
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,720
people's safety and so I can't have an

194
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,520
organization that has an ego that

195
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,940
becomes too big that that's not the

196
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,829
priority so they have to leave that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

197
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,600
the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job to make sure</font>

198
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,550
that its communicated you know

199
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,810
effectively through our our business as

200
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,449
an example so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got Nick</font>

201
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nickerson in the room he will be our</font>

202
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,250
moderator I would read off his bio but

203
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,740
it was hilarious you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should absolutely</font>

204
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,870
yeah yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet you should</font>

205
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,510
go check it out we we crowdsource to buy

206
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,670
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter and if you ever do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

207
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,380
highly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take everything you</font>

208
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,479
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Twitter it just beat it right</font>

209
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,450
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bio would be perfect it was</font>

210
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,570
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was yeah that might not be</font>

211
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,180
hot maybe you have to trade on oh there

212
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:37,450
we go it's good technology yeah there we

213
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,719
go okay so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take over and</font>

214
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,760
carry out you know so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many awesome</font>

215
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,880
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are talking about that I</font>

216
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,850
feel like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the winds that you guys</font>

217
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,580
have had separately there's a ton of

218
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,740
questions to be asked not necessarily as

219
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,680
much about what the win was but how you

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,990
want it and to me that's what I think

221
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the fascinating things are and I</font>

222
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,870
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of that is really driven</font>

223
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,940
by what you get passionate about I think

224
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rarely in any of our careers</font>

225
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,090
do we pursue something without passion

226
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,420
and ever make huge exponential pieces of

227
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,150
success so one of the things i'd love to

228
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,860
explore with you guys is really what are

229
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,709
those passionate moments what are some

230
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,930
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things where you actually had the</font>

231
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,570
switch turn on and you said this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

232
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,819
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm going to do or why I'm</font>

233
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,180
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this is how it turns me on</font>

234
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,760
this is how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> fulfills something for</font>

235
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,380
myself and my role in for the

236
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,930
in those things joined together because

237
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,439
I hey I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a huge gap</font>

238
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:46,709
often where people just go and do work

239
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,360
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are doing work that is very</font>

240
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,580
very very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

241
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,110
accomplishing things that are extremely

242
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard or even to the point where people</font>

243
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,000
say I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done in my</font>

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,310
company so there's there's hope that

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,690
exists there and I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

246
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,400
hear some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different stories of</font>

247
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,220
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what what are those hope moments</font>

248
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,380
where where did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the strength of</font>

249
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,860
the support and how did you nurture that

250
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,590
into the successes you've had well

251
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,540
kicked out off so this is a story I

252
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">think Josh wants me to tell but when i</font>

253
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,620
first met<font color="#CCCCCC"> josh and found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out about on</font>

254
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,620
the cavalry<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had a kind of a</font>

255
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,360
realization that over the course of my

256
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,940
career most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that i had done</font>

257
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">was financial stuff so it helps make</font>

258
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,130
companies at least as profitable or help

259
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,890
them not lose as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money but the</font>

260
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,580
first day on my job as an infosec person

261
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a hospital and i walked into a</font>

262
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,540
situation where they were having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

263
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,110
natal intensive care unit fetal heart

264
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,670
monitors down right so physicians had to

265
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,950
spend extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> time nurses had to be around</font>

266
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there was patient care on the line</font>

267
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,530
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mike was talking about and they've</font>

268
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,150
been basically infected with a piece of

269
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,420
malicious software that had worked its

270
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,310
way around the hospital so calling the

271
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,380
manufacturer they were unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

272
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,150
anything because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a medical device</font>

273
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,980
and so they couldn't modify the medical

274
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,199
device to remove the modification from

275
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,650
the medical device I'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wrap</font>

276
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,660
your brains around that but the second

277
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that I did was went to the</font>

278
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,680
executives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

279
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,750
look we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to fix this problem because</font>

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">these devices are broken simply</font>

281
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,160
replacing them with equivalent devices

282
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,660
will get them the new devices broken as

283
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,810
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to fix the underlying</font>

284
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,230
problem so with the justification from

285
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,739
hospital executives used<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit to</font>

286
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,080
pop the box kill the malware drop the

287
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,370
patch bounce it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it came back up and</font>

288
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,899
the doctors were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back to</font>

289
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,879
doing dr.e things

290
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,769
I left him<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone after that but I had a</font>

291
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,660
realization<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10 years of my</font>

292
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">info SEC career I've never had as much</font>

293
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,899
impact as I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first day right</font>

294
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:56,819
which was was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> awful realization to</font>

295
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,999
have I've essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone down my</font>

296
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:01,769
trajectory has gone like that so I said

297
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:05,189
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flip that around and so</font>

298
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">today I regularly have moments where I</font>

299
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,209
feel like I'm having wins when I talk to

300
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">policymaker when I talk to somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

301
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:13,949
in industry and you just see that light

302
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,939
bulb<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on over their head not because</font>

303
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:17,160
I've beat them over the head with

304
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:19,618
technical stuff but because I've found a

305
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,990
way to social engineer my way into their

306
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:25,139
language and to get them to realize oh

307
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,970
that's why this matters and so I have

308
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,379
those moments a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> often now and</font>

309
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:34,399
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drives me it gets me</font>

310
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:36,959
passion<font color="#E5E5E5"> look there she goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll</font>

311
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,850
like I mentioned my intro I'm extremely

312
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,800
passionate about securing our ERP

313
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,959
systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that's a challenge if</font>

314
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,939
you participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that yourself the</font>

315
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,339
industry average is that about two

316
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:49,199
percent of the issued patches and

317
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,959
advisories get addressed because those

318
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,839
systems are designed to largely to be

319
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,388
untouched unpatched you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> unmodified</font>

320
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,999
you know the CIA triad a is kind of the

321
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:01,800
king when it comes to ERP systems and

322
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:03,449
you know the journey<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I went on with</font>

323
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,849
my management<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess is I said well you</font>

324
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:07,498
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> first let's discuss what makes</font>

325
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,230
earpiece special right and it's things

326
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:11,670
like well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where by far your most</font>

327
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,800
important information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in your company</font>

328
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that makes it pretty special it's</font>

329
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,579
also supported by incredibly specialized

330
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,399
teams because it's incredibly

331
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,929
specialized technology it's also written

332
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,370
in languages so if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one vendor</font>

333
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,410
example right s80 it's written in

334
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,420
languages that no one knows or very few

335
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,249
people doing it SATs case it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bop</font>

336
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,309
right who knows show of hands how many

337
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:36,420
people here know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah Bob one excellent</font>

338
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:39,540
that too that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right right yeah</font>

339
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,639
yeah so the polling in here is about

340
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,240
right right for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry so very few</font>

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,589
people know it tools it doesn't

342
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,660
integrate with any standard security

343
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,490
tools right it barely has any static

344
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,350
code analysis really none it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

345
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,899
no dynamic of any kind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

346
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,279
safely<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it doesn't send any telemetry</font>

347
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk or</font>

348
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,519
site or any of those tools it's just not

349
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,699
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with other security</font>

350
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,839
tools what else makes it special

351
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:05,579
organizationally it tends to be operated

352
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">by different teams because of how much</font>

353
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,209
knowledge you have to have about the

354
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:10,920
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that erp supports</font>

355
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,319
generally the people who support those

356
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,748
systems are also mostly business<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

357
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:18,120
or kind of business plus right business

358
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,620
with some IT so that's what makes ERP

359
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,839
special but what makes them very

360
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,879
attractive two attackers it's basically

361
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,499
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same list right it's highly</font>

362
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,749
specialized language that no one knows

363
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:29,220
most your most important data is there

364
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:32,249
doesn't integrate with any security

365
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,139
tools I mean it's it is the you know my

366
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:35,579
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the next big area for</font>

367
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,199
attackers to look at and we have some

368
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,729
information that suggests that's already

369
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,219
starting to happen right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font>

370
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,870
23 years ago when you sis went down the

371
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,199
root cause analysis was it came in

372
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,790
through SI p and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the vendors are</font>

373
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,069
starting to get wise to that right there

374
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,170
starting in just randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> open ports to</font>

375
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:54,089
the outside yeah well so oh wheres<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP</font>

376
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,170
whatever well if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it so</font>

377
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,420
that's a good example if you just look

378
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the standard hardening if you just</font>

379
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,240
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the standard installation</font>

380
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,949
guidelines they tell you these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">port's we need except it's not ports</font>

382
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's ranges and it's like okay we need</font>

383
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,559
33 65,000 well it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit tighter</font>

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,410
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not much right we need</font>

385
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,730
3333 through<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3400 I don't know is there</font>

386
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,620
anything in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that range that might be</font>

387
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,959
problematic if every endpoint had open

388
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,089
right 3389 and some others so you know

389
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,579
it's things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they're also</font>

390
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,079
trying to catch up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with security so in</font>

391
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one particular vendors example</font>

392
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:31,138
they've issued<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3600 security patches in</font>

393
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,059
the last three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> two systems that</font>

394
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,899
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed that you spent the last 20</font>

395
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,069
years engineering processes around

396
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:40,350
preventing changes in those<font color="#E5E5E5"> environments</font>

397
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:42,120
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick question for you yeah was</font>

398
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,519
there an ah-ha moment where you were

399
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,250
like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my crusade like that's the</font>

400
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,959
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have looked at all these other</font>

401
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">things but was there a moment where you</font>

402
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,579
were profoundly taken back and said I I

403
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,800
have to not focus on other things so

404
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,899
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can focus on this yes but it</font>

405
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,660
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bit boring and that that aha</font>

406
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,790
moment was when i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a number of</font>

407
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know industry conferences besom</font>

408
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,389
framework you know conference all these

409
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,640
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> places and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking people</font>

410
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,400
do you care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> erp</font>

411
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,920
and I almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> never got a yes and so the</font>

412
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,780
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very passionate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

413
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,240
is because I feel like no one else does

414
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I actually don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ERP systems at</font>

415
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,319
all I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> him yes you know people tell</font>

416
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,180
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you should just kind of like</font>

417
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,800
become the ERP guy and I every one's got

418
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,510
their banner and like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really don't</font>

419
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,940
want to because I hate these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

420
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,770
hate it like they're ugly you know their

421
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,660
interface is atrocious it's not a sexy

422
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology to be in but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't feel</font>

423
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,690
like anyone else cares so that's why I'm

424
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,889
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you'd love your hate yeah you</font>

425
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:46,920
got that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my story that's beautiful</font>

426
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so quick followed to that</font>

427
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,740
before we go next um was there a moment

428
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:55,110
that you felt beyond that where you said

429
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my crusade and then you took</font>

430
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,490
that to the workplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> and got the</font>

431
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,409
workplace to support your crusade

432
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,850
instead of you just waving the banner

433
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,260
sitting at a conference by yourself

434
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,550
going care about ERP and everybody's

435
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,730
like we don't know what that guy is I

436
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,430
don't wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> up yeah so you know I I would</font>

437
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,200
describe and any companies relationship

438
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,900
with their ERP vendor regardless who it

439
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,270
is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know an incredibly bad</font>

440
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,980
marriage with an incredibly high cost of

441
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,170
divorce so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it right so</font>

442
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,270
you stay tied in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and with</font>

443
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,910
every passing year your technical debt

444
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,340
grows right you add 11,000 more

445
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,110
customizations so you know what what

446
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,909
helped is when I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my management</font>

447
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,169
and said look you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

448
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">mention the word security or</font>

449
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:40,380
vulnerability or risk but how much money

450
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,959
are you willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay tomorrow for a</font>

451
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,450
bad decision from yesterday so I

452
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,670
basically use technical debt as a way to

453
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,290
drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the security discussion</font>

454
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,450
and it actually worked very well luckily

455
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,159
I'm in an organization where safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

456
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,450
security are non-discretionary so we

457
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,730
don't have to worry about prioritization

458
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,900
and is it above or below<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line so if</font>

459
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,700
you you know if you make the right case

460
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,910
there's very good support an artistic

461
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,000
organization that's awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

though when I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> at is</font>

494

<font color="#E5E5E5">something Karen actually said so she</font>

497
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,910
slide up there and what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting for</font>

498
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,520
me is we're actually starting to change

499
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,930
we actually see that now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've</font>

500
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,010
talked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh and had different</font>

501
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,930
meetings we've talked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

502
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,270
here in this room not just working with

503
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big-three car makers or the car</font>

504
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,510
makers not just working with academics

505
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,670
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with small research</font>

506
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,500
organizations we're listening we're

507
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to change because traditionally</font>

508
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,310
we are reactive we have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

509
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,350
problem or the burning<font color="#E5E5E5"> river to happen</font>

510
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,510
and we understand that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

511
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,219
happen we do move too slow for that

512
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,390
matter of fact a lot of companies move

513
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,210
too slow for that that's why there's

514
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,740
patches every week for stuff so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

515
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,030
I do appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I do think</font>

516
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,490
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's excited me and</font>

517
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">my team now is that our administration</font>

518
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,160
what we're doing now is actually

519
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,780
recognizing that and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

520
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,460
change trying to make a difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

521
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to keep that right now with no</font>

522
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,590
consequences as much as we can in the

523
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,600
future

524
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,689
was there a point where that for you

525
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,000
kind of got executed into into work like

526
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,400
was there a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you did to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

527
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to know it or did it come from a</font>

528
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">hon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi or was that like how did that get</font>

529
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:47,590
sticky so I should give the truthful

530
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:49,209
answer or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government answer I'll say</font>

531
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,070
the truthful answer it's pretty

532
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,760
effective when you can take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level</font>

533
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:57,549
politician take a policymaker take your

534
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,440
boss into a car that's doing 45 miles an

535
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,610
hour down the road and from your phone

536
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,970
push a button and have it steer to the

537
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,719
right it's yeah demos are very very

538
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,789
effective it you know it is a dog and

539
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,200
pony show yes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what you</font>

540
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,779
can read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or you can actually</font>

541
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,510
sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seat be on a test track and</font>

542
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,820
do this but it really wakes people up

543
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,679
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you see that potential for this</font>

544
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,590
to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you start to listen</font>

545
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand and you know</font>

546
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not easy problems to deal with</font>

547
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to awesome thank you what</font>

548
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:34,809
exciting thing on that you mentioned 35

549
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,330
thousand two hundred lives lost on the

550
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,370
roads and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I know</font>

551
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the government is racing towards as</font>

552
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,229
well as the auto industry is autonomous

553
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,940
vehicles the simple reason being that

554
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,240
ninety-four percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and their</font>

555
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,649
stats from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your box correct right</font>

556
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,120
ninety-four percent of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

557
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,739
human error so if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

558
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,899
humans out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the loop you could</font>

559
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,870
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> save tens of thousands of</font>

560
00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:03,189
lives and what equates to basically 80

561
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:05,649
to 100 deaths a day on us roadways so

562
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,020
one of the things when i was talking to

563
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,449
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> autumn automaker in Germany they said</font>

564
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bo where German we moved slow so that we</font>

565
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,500
get it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and</font>

566
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,570
safety stuff right I said great while

567
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,100
you're moving slowly there are

568
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,020
fatalities on the roadways that could

569
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,939
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevented if we had maybe</font>

570
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,250
abandoned some of the security controls

571
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,200
so I'm not advocating for going the

572
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,630
other way but either side of that

573
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,700
spectrum is wrong right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it will</font>

574
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,429
cause death we have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

575
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,690
that middle point is and maybe abandon

576
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:37,960
some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think we</font>

577
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">should do out of you know muscle muscle</font>

578
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,860
memory or reflex like oh

579
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,380
put antivirus on it or long passwords

580
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,540
right maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to rethink what that</font>

581
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,460
is and find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different way that could</font>

582
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,040
also then if we find a way to do it in

583
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,480
cars and medical devices etc maybe we

584
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,000
could retrofit some of that to the IT

585
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:01,300
corporate arena and have fewer failures

586
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,750
they are two last one so the progress so

587
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:08,620
it might sound kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of corny to you but</font>

588
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've always been you know a boy</font>

589
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,199
scout I like fixing things or making

590
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:19,330
something you know happen the right way

591
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:24,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I guess my passion or my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aha moments</font>

592
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:27,820
are in order for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

593
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,190
the ability to fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

594
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,700
difference and not just within the

595
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations that I operate but even at</font>

596
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,510
the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale so that's why you see</font>

597
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,840
and those that know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there you</font>

598
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:46,720
know I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my word is my bond and</font>

599
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,800
that's how you know I'm able to execute

600
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,650
and I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by bringing others that</font>

601
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,370
have similar responsibilities I<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped</font>

602
00:24:53,650 --> 00:25:01,240
elevate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire whole so that's kind</font>

603
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,889
of kind of mine my hitman so in that and

604
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,850
I'm stupid to have to take notes for

605
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in that what was there a moment</font>

606
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:13,750
there and where you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AHA up</font>

607
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:17,470
the food chain and say I'm taking this

608
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,540
on and and they went from<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's doing</font>

609
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,880
this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you're taking it on we got</font>

610
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,950
you yeah when and again back on the

611
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:31,000
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> the demo p by bringing in you know</font>

612
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:34,090
the dark side into your you know into

613
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,550
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> offices and tearing down the wall</font>

614
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,280
so that people there is no dark side

615
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:43,450
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same objectives and goals</font>

616
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,210
that that we do that was sort of some of

617
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,730
that aha moment within the organization

618
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,580
and so I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring them in we need</font>

619
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,800
it to demonstrate you know directly on

620
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,409
you know

621
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,200
your babies are ugly here that we got to

622
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:01,320
clean some of these dogs up and so you

623
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,630
know when you do that and you do it in a

624
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,330
in a you know compelling way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

625
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,760
organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it means a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot and</font>

626
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,550
and it's kind of and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us and</font>

627
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,310
from you know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do but you</font>

628
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,800
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking with</font>

629
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:19,980
Billy Rios about you know one of his

630
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:24,510
last pieces on the pump and until he

631
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:27,780
actually uploaded in and showed the FDA

632
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,690
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> demo of it that's when they had the</font>

633
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,910
aha moment and they got it he could talk

634
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,680
about you know the compromises and the

635
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,400
vulnerabilities and what was discovered

636
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,320
and you know until he<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you know blue</font>

637
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,570
but you know they weren't going to get

638
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,850
it until they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually you know</font>

639
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,860
see it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> smacked item in front of</font>

640
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,110
their face so keeping his smacked in

641
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,209
front of their faces kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I tried</font>

642
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,590
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's also a second</font>

643
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,200
important lesson there which is he

644
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:58,350
demonstrated it to them not drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> dough</font>

645
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,420
day on stage right so one of the things

646
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I observed is if you go in and talk to</font>

647
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,070
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trust for kloof away with</font>

648
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,840
respect on both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they'll</font>

649
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,310
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whatever you say if you</font>

650
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead put them in a position where</font>

651
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,090
they're surprised and have to react they

652
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,600
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably react in a way that is</font>

653
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,610
opposite to what you want so breaking

654
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,290
down that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall between people who are</font>

655
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,030
both trying to do the right thing and

656
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,639
bringing them together as a really

657
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:28,320
really critical part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing this I</font>

658
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:31,560
think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome so the again I'm</font>

659
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">very simple so i distilled those things</font>

660
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,080
in the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hear them right and to</font>

661
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,000
me it speaks to me everybody's story

662
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,540
speaks to me in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but really</font>

663
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,920
congruent way where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

664
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,240
demonstration being one of those kind of

665
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,930
things that helps you break down the

666
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,890
walls but there's also some really point

667
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:56,080
in other things i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know when</font>

668
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,390
you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the erp plan</font>

669
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,460
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to a financial</font>

670
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,470
means that's that's changing and

671
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,440
translating the conversation right but

672
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:07,720
the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kia that really wasn't</font>

673
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,080
financial the key to that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font>

674
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,710
and and I and I can see in some ways is

675
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,769
that you reframed the context of what

676
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,529
was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to their language you said</font>

677
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:22,990
if you care about safety and security

678
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:25,659
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this into the bucket</font>

679
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,130
that you care about so that I can be

680
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:28,929
passionate you can be passionate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

681
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,809
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same goal on the same path</font>

682
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:35,940
and I think that that's a huge thing for

683
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:39,809
all of us to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from in the beginning</font>

684
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,880
beyond demonstration what I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this</font>

685
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:44,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pride of ownership right my word</font>

686
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,419
is my bond that's what i do i say i'm

687
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to do it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that's</font>

688
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:50,950
another really really powerful thing for

689
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:53,889
all of us to to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at and</font>

690
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,419
learning from to say if you're going to

691
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do it with</font>

692
00:28:55,419 --> 00:29:00,159
integrity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity is going to</font>

693
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,919
gain you the type of political capital

694
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,779
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of flexibility that may not</font>

695
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">be present</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may you may have to work</font>

696
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten years to get your integrity to the</font>

697
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,178
level of that where it's every single

698
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,100
time they say they're going to do what

699
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,529
they do it and and then you'll have

700
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,750
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those pieces and and the</font>

701
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:21,480
demonstration piece is beautiful because

702
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:24,279
demonstration is actually really hard

703
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,980
demonstrations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hard because you're</font>

704
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,549
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do I hit</font>

705
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,500
somebody with the nerf bat to like annoy

706
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,330
them enough to know that they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

707
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,250
got hit and with a steel bat but not

708
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,199
hard enough that they're mad at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

709
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,419
hitting them with a nerf bat and that's

710
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,000
a real kind of delicate line to play and

711
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:45,639
so being able to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute on</font>

712
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,169
those things I think takes the integrity

713
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:50,168
I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes the pride of ownership</font>

714
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:53,200
I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes where we're with you I</font>

715
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,320
see this impact it takes I am driven by

716
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the amount of impact that happens and</font>

717
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,500
the more impact that happens the more

718
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,480
fueled I get about it the more

719
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,860
passion I put into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more impact</font>

720
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,280
happens after that and it's this

721
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,959
fireball that goes down using each one

722
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,750
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

723
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,640
have some distinct views on together to

724
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,950
break down all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the walls and to</font>

725
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,930
change what you love doing into what

726
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,060
you're doing and if I can just add to

727
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">your comment I think one part that you</font>

728
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,710
mentioned i want to emphasize even more

729
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,690
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know this may not be may be</font>

730
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,610
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular thing to say but if you</font>

731
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,900
want to influence your organization you

732
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to start speaking their language</font>

733
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,490
right you can't do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> backflip every time</font>

734
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,570
you find cross-site scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry</font>

735
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,090
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the grand scheme of things it just</font>

736
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,830
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter it really doesn't it's it</font>

737
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,600
you know whether to fix that or not is

738
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,820
just another business decision just like

739
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,980
whether it's to upgrade a valve fitting

740
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,480
or whatever you know build a new campus

741
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,360
it's just another business decision and

742
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we will have far more respect</font>

743
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,290
you know in our boardroom and with our

744
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,969
senior management when we can speak more

745
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,700
their language which is around you know

746
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,650
business prioritization<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4x adjustments</font>

747
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,300
you know depreciation resource capital

748
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,710
around the world mean that that's how

749
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,020
these decisions are made we can't

750
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,550
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be kind of odd stepchildren</font>

751
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,560
in that discussion right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

752
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:13,780
start being active participants in the

753
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:15,490
business discussion um lastly of my

754
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,910
interest because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm selfish and I get</font>

755
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:22,640
to moderate so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask your questions</font>

756
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:26,580
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you survive the fatigue</font>

757
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:30,180
because you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> making profound</font>

758
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,030
changes in macro industries that have

759
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,610
never been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make these kinds of</font>

760
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:38,010
changes you're breaking down huge walls

761
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:42,240
that people aren't even willing to scale

762
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:45,629
and breaking bricks is tiring like what

763
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,620
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> game I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

764
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">say drink and also I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know whether</font>

765
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:56,030
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm getting old or whether</font>

766
00:31:51,930 --> 00:32:01,290
my fatigue outlasts my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drink</font>

767
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:03,899
but now for myself I'm introverted so I

768
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,700
just like go into a quiet room and sit

769
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,070
and maybe listen to some music and spend

770
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,050
my weekends like not leaving the house

771
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,149
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not the healthiest thing</font>

772
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,100
but if you've been in DC lately it's

773
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,230
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the temperature here but with also</font>

774
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,139
a hundred percent humidity so it's not

775
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,820
really fun to go outside but but I know

776
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,780
other people deal with it in different

777
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,810
ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the condensed answer</font>

778
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,139
would be whatever recharges you go do

779
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:32,850
that let the rest see you guys cuz I

780
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,770
imagine y'all have like secret tips that

781
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:39,689
I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn from because I get tired</font>

782
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:41,850
quick well so for me I mean it's not

783
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,650
fatigue yet I mean automotive

784
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity is kind of an emerging</font>

785
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,180
field you're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see companies</font>

786
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,010
now have you know cyber directors to

787
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,960
report to CEOs you're starting to see

788
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,460
companies making changes in their

789
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,750
designs you're starting to have

790
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,610
companies come to at least us the

791
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,050
government and say look we realize this

796
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">really an emerging area right now you</font>

797
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,810
know a back to Karen government slow

798

move slow you know no change but you

799
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,379
know this area right now because of

800
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,870
automation because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle-to-vehicle</font>

801
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">communication because of higher end</font>

802
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,669
audio systems and the cars you know this

803

809
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,740
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say the tools to allow them to</font>

810
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,600
be compromised or to allow them to be

811
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable you know you can't take the</font>

57 Chevy and steer it to the left at

division i have a new lab and it's very

818
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:02,390
exciting for us so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> right at that</font>

819
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,790
point yeah what good i'm eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

820
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,400
what an opportunity for people who feel

821
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,759
it to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your industry and go honey</font>

823
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,710
there's also probably a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

824
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:17,029
this room who can help fatigue you we

831
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,918
ask the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had kind of a little</font>

832
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,929
bit of a crisis<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like wow I've never</font>

833
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,658
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but the honest answer</font>

834
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:40,310
is I would agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you um it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

835
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,050
even close I'm not like I barely I've

836
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,899
barely gotten started I have so much

837
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,220
left in the tank let's say where no

838
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,449
one's even put a dent yet to slow me

839
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,250
down I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I still have a</font>

840
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:50,480
tremendous one way of passion to carry

841
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,480
me through all inside I don't feel the

842
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,100
slightest bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fatigue um yeah I don't</font>

843
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel it at all I mean and I well I'll</font>

00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,520
tell you what I want to do I want to

845
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">build a world-class software security</font>

846
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,930

847
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,799
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotten started not even close to</font>

848
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:10,339
love it so I would describe kind of your

849
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,610
fatigue from you know I've hit that wall

850
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,830
and because you you constantly as you

851
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,680
said trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to knock the bricks down and</font>

852
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:23,170
you hit a few of them and it's like okay

853
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:26,210
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting me anywhere and so I</font>

854
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,850
i also don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i called it fatigue</font>

855
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,310
