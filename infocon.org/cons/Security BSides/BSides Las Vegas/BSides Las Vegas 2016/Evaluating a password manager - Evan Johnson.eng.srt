00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,638
evan johnson he's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at lost</font>

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,019
paws before now he's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare and</font>

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,690
again another talk i'm looking forward

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a little bit about password managers</font>

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:28,920
Evan hello cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so my talk is</font>

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,308
called evaluating a password manager but

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,360
it should say lots of password managers

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:39,989
and how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> should evaluate them it's</font>

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,840
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a supposed to be give people a</font>

11
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,459
holistic view on password managers so

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,809
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I work at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare as a</font>

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,000
security systems engineer so I wear a

14
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of different random hats there I'm</font>

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,840
kind of the company's de facto app<font color="#CCCCCC"> sect</font>

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,110
person besides that I like hunt

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,630
vulnerabilities in our products and our

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,000
infrastructure and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I</font>

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,658
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of either fix them or come up</font>

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">with plans to fix them or push them off</font>

21
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,979
on someone else who can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and and</font>

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,949
I've kind of been working on the website

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,140
too as well I've since we were just

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,509
talking about accounts and account

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,009
management I rewrote all of the account

26
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,110
management stuff for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare</font>

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,650
website and how it does sessions how it

28
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,189
does all these different cryptographic

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,240
tokens like see sort oaken's and stuff

30
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:44,789
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also wrote pass go which is a</font>

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,399
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager written and go and it's</font>

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,340
command line based the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,130
wrote it was because I wanted a password

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,610
manager with more modern crypto for some

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,130
systems systems things I do like I use

36
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:06,090
it for protecting my ssh keys and and

37
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:08,848
whatnot oh and i worked at last pass as

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,790
an engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i worked there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a year</font>

39
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:14,010
and wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of code so if you use</font>

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">LastPass and you like it</font>

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:23,129
I helped with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so trigger</font>

42
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,810
warning we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

43
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,439
password managers and the reason I put

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,440
this slide is because password managers

45
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,379
online are super polarizing if you've

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,269
ever read a hacker news or reddit thread

47
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,429
or Twitter thread about people talking

48
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about password managers it generally</font>

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,900
goes nowhere and it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,819
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people arguing and basically</font>

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,180
everybody in those threads is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert</font>

52
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:57,480
and they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the one speaking you</font>

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:59,400
on the right place now so so a lot of

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">people love LastPass they loved keepass</font>

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,470
they loved one password they hated they

56
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,180
hated all those same things different

57
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,349
people hate LastPass different people

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,879
hate keep a ski pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> X and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

59
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,250
what this talk is about this talk is

60
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,399
supposed to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> general and</font>

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:21,359
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can that's unbiased and</font>

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,500
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of step back from from what</font>

63
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:28,859
you like and what you don't like and

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:31,680
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of be able to evaluate what is good</font>

65
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:34,410
and so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be throwing bad</font>

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:42,329
password managers under the bus yet and

67
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:45,150
we'll we'll talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

68
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,340
about the talk we're gonna die<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

69
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,109
couple goals so I want to define the

70
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,660
properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all password managers</font>

71
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,819
that regular people should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,269
talk is mostly geared towards regular

73
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,790
people point out some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

74
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:03,629
really good that password managers that

75
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,078
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them do and and talk about some</font>

76
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,429
technical details about some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

77
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:13,310
well we'll dive into a little technical

78
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:16,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and so which password managers so</font>

79
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,389
if you're unfamiliar which may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font>

80
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,409
are you're not if you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

81
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,270
one password is like I would describe it

82
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,039
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple juggernaut of password</font>

83
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,260
managers it's

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,920
it was for a long time considered really

85
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apple centric and but great password</font>

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,370
manager LastPass windows and linux

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,220
people liked it these two are probably

88
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,540
the oldest the two at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top LastPass</font>

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,360
in one password and last passes also got

90
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:52,740
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat got really popular the</font>

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,460
Android UX was really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for they</font>

92
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,100
really did well<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> android</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and linux and</font>

93
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,500
windows and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not Apple for a</font>

94
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,010
while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's dashlane dashlane</font>

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,620
is pretty pricey and they've they've

96
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,380
raised a ton of venture capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

97
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just checked before this talk and it</font>

98
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,640
was like 52 million they've raised a

99
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:18,000
Serie C which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an absurd amount of</font>

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:22,560
money for password managers keeper which

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,080
is from a I first heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it at last</font>

102
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,340
pass and it kind of got its start on

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,340
mobile I think and it it's it kind of

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,680
developed from there and they took off

105
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,140
from mobile then there's keepass keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> sx</font>

106
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,600
these are the whole keepass environment

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,570
like ecosystem really confuses me and I

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't fully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it there's lots</font>

109
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them and then password box rest in</font>

110
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,080
peace they got end of life they got

111
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">bought by intel a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and</font>

112
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,630
they just got<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of life pass is a</font>

113
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,850
command-line password manager written by

114
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,800
this really good systems programmer guy

115
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,650
it's written in bash<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's get backed in</font>

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">g PG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base and then so i put these two at</font>

117
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom these are the most</font>

118
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,660
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Excel spreadsheets and</font>

119
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,950
password journals these are things

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,570
people might be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to</font>

121
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">all we want to compare all these</font>

122
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:27,000
together so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a generic</font>

123
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,160
design diagram of the it might be hard

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,280
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level parts of a password</font>

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,250
manager so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put four of them and there</font>

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,780
might not be four of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and maybe some</font>

127
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,630
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more tightly coupled than</font>

128
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,570
others you have the cloud servers where

129
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,450
if it's if the password manager sinks

130
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,430
you have servers that the password

131
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,420
managers are the passwords are stored on

132
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,140
then you have kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend core</font>

133
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,600
of a password manager so if you use

134
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,909
1password there's a thick client there

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,430
and LastPass it's all extension based

136
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,920
and this is the part that talks to these

137
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,550
servers and gets down the passwords and

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:12,210
decrypts them and then you have the

139
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,700
application core integration I just this

140
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,690
is the UI the part<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all the features</font>

141
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are built on top of this decryption</font>

142
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,650
all this all the junk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,810
decrypted all the features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

144
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,370
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why I put this</font>

145
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,440
last one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a part of the</font>

146
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,060
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager just the application</font>

147
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,210
that the password goes into that's where

148
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,930
that's a final<font color="#CCCCCC"> resting place for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

149
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:42,479
password goes into hopefully the correct

150
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,890
application and like I said some<font color="#CCCCCC"> my some</font>

151
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,060
password managers might have all four of

152
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:52,590
these some might not so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part</font>

153
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,420
is the servers and this is going to be

154
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,210
missing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that don't sink and</font>

155
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> important thing here when you're</font>

156
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,590
evaluating a password manager it the

157
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,780
first is really obvious that your

158
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,880
passwords should not be on the server in

159
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,070
plain text and there are actually some

160
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,960
like enterprise password management

161
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:16,980
solutions where it is in plain text and

162
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,320
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise these these are</font>

163
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">like really big business like 100</font>

164
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,849
million in revenue doing password

165
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:30,030
password management at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've heard</font>

166
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:33,990
of and it's kind of insane but what else

167
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,819
should be encrypted here it's everybody

168
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,729
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of does it different all the</font>

169
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,560
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager so the big two things</font>

170
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally differ is some password</font>

171
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,520
managers don't encrypt URLs and some

172
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,530
other ones don't encrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames and I</font>

173
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,079
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a right answer here</font>

174
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,930
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not that's good or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font>

175
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,750
or

176
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,399
I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> could there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room for</font>

177
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,649
improvement for both of them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

178
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:05,620
really see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge reason why why having</font>

179
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:10,480
everything encrypted or I'm not sure how

180
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:14,110
to weigh this and so I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

181
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,050
tick boxes for evaluating what's stored

182
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,520
and it's whether it's encrypted which

183
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,829
pretty much all password managers

184
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,230
encrypt what they have on their server

185
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,680
and then when the passwords that are on

186
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,330
the server and then whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

187
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,339
they encrypt all site data so if aurl's

188
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,180
if a URL isn't encrypted then they

189
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:40,149
wouldn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that second tick box here</font>

190
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:46,779
the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager wouldn't so what</font>

191
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:49,510
else is on this slide all right and you

192
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,610
generally have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end part of an</font>

193
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,740
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does all this heavy</font>

194
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:59,470
lifting a fetching encrypted blob data

195
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:02,730
and decrypting it and this is pretty

196
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:06,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">boring that all it does is kind of</font>

197
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,500
consume API get a bunch of data prompt

198
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,500
you for your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and decrypt it and</font>

199
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:21,790
sometimes so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where all most of</font>

200
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:27,310
the crypto lives so it'll all the crypto

201
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:29,439
primitive choices live here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess</font>

202
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's significant because all the</font>

203
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:39,430
crypto lives there and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the features</font>

204
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:41,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> users see auto fills passwords</font>

205
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:46,120
contains all the bells and whistles

206
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:47,980
contains user interface so the this

207
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,430
might manifest itself in different ways

208
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,050
like auto fill most password managers

209
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,329
will have an autofill feature where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

210
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,359
just press a<font color="#CCCCCC"> button in it pace your</font>

211
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:02,920
password in or maybe not paste maybe it

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:06,700
all just modify the Dom on an HTML page

213
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,670
and that

214
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,100
all lives here and all the flows of

215
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:16,030
generating a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> password and saving it</font>

216
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,490
and and then communicating with this

217
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">back end process that then talks to the</font>

218
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,760
API to save this new encrypted blob

219
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:29,500
that's that all starts at at this layer

220
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">user facing and then one of the most</font>

221
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:38,590
important features that you'd see from

222
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:41,079
that user see is security details about

223
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,680
their passwords so if they're reusing a

224
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,990
lot of passwords if they're weak

225
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,719
passwords are everywhere in their

226
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,750
password vault good<font color="#E5E5E5"> password managers</font>

227
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,830
will tell users that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have bad</font>

228
00:11:52,750 --> 00:12:00,490
password hygiene and though they might

229
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:06,430
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really loud about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what</font>

230
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:08,170
what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> matters and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

231
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,849
breaks down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into two things what</font>

232
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,430
features should all password managers

233
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,670
have and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security critical and</font>

234
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:21,520
need actual technical eyes to look at

235
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:23,410
and and and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evaluate and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

236
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,900
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is more about usability</font>

237
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,430
and the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is security because</font>

238
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:34,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of all there is in in this</font>

239
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:39,910
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what should they</font>

240
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,500
have high level really fast they're the

241
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,510
most important features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

242
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">with is password manager our password</font>

243
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,770
generator to create to create different

kinds of passwords if a password<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager</font>

245
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:54,730
doesn't have that it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad just a</font>

246
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,620
duplicate password finder security

247
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,600
finding security details like we

248
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,100
mentioned if you have duplicate

249
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,050
passwords if you have weak passwords

250
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,050
your password managers should notify you

251
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,210
strong crypto this is a interesting one

252
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,340
which we'll talk about in a minute but

253
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,500
your password manager should be should

254
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,030
have strong crypto just having crypto

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:23,030
doesn't doesn't really help

256
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:26,189
it has to be strong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all not all</font>

257
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,890
password managers are vetted as as such

258
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,450
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you won't have you won't</font>

259
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,040
have as big of a problem with the big

260
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,680
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I listed at the beginning but</font>

261
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,480
there are hundreds of password managers

262
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,400
and once you get out in the weeds and

263
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,490
you may find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that works for</font>

264
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,170
you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of scary if if nobody's</font>

265
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,020
actually looked at the technical details

266
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,270
under under the hood and then import

267
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,810
export you should be able to jump ship

268
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,579
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hate your password manager and</font>

269
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,060
the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

270
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:03,870
2016 is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> password manager having mobile</font>

271
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:06,150
good mobile user experience and what did

272
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,440
I put on the slide password managers

273
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:14,040
within mobile yeah so in in 2016 like so

274
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,090
many users are mobile first and that's

275
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,280
is getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more prevalent and</font>

276
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:26,520
if if you're if you just download

277
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,890
keepass XYZ and it's somebody just

278
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,380
forked keepass and made some changes in

279
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,630
it you can't actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your</font>

280
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,550
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and open</font>

281
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:41,760
source it it like is not going to help

282
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:44,760
you that much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so here is like a</font>

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,590
snapchat sign up screen and I pick

284
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,189
snapchat because I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picture</font>

285
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:53,610
snapchat as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next well it's</font>

286
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,300
already arrived the next social network

287
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,650
like and I also picked it because at the

288
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,969
beginning of Twitter people were like

289
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,890
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really stupid and it kind of</font>

290
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,110
became something really big and so

291
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,600
people signing up on Twitter they might

292
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,030
choose a stupid password like that my

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,860
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> password on snapchat was really</font>

294
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:15,480
horrific<font color="#E5E5E5"> haha but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh but like who knows</font>

295
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,220
snapchat might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important like</font>

296
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,250
a year from now people might be getting

297
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,810
their news from from news clips on

298
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,410
snapchat who knows and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a</font>

299
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:31,020
password manager can't reach their

300
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,990
mobile users that's like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

301
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:38,030
bad

302
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:39,800
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just outside of password</font>

303
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,069
managers authentication on mobile

304
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,050
devices is just atrocious people have

305
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,240
tried like federated credentials in apps

306
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,910
like pokemons go came out and they had

307
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google the google sign up and</font>

308
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,010
besides the fact that like the you could

309
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,100
sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with your pre-existing google</font>

310
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,890
account and besides the fact that the

311
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,530
permissions were way too permissive on

312
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,100
what you actually allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> pokemon go to</font>

313
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:09,199
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> its it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just bad UX like you had</font>

314
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to completely reenter your username and</font>

315
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">password it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't get anything for</font>

316
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,560
free so password managers are the best

317
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:22,070
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in mobile UX right now so this</font>

318
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:27,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the this kind of shows off on uber</font>

319
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:30,230
who uses the agile bits the one password

320
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,740
they have a way for apps to integrate

321
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,110
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> password manager and I feel</font>

322
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:40,790
strongly that this is if your password

323
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:43,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">manager does not have this option if you</font>

324
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,420
use iOS so obviously it's different for

325
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android but on iOS if if you're not</font>

326
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,280
taking your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password manager seriously</font>

327
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,439
and you and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are up working at a</font>

328
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,990
password manager company like this is

329
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">super important this little it's in the</font>

red not my email<font color="#CCCCCC"> blurred out but the</font>

331
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:08,300
little lock icon that will allow you to

332
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and paste your password</font>

335
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,640
it allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this this icon and</font>

336
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:24,260
utilize a password manager from inside

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:30,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nap and the other thing in mobile</font>

338
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:33,170
is browser support and well while most

339
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,960
apps have not figured this out most

340
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,630
password managers have figured browser

341
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:43,940
support out and pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all of them</font>

342
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,180
will will support different pretty much

343
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,090
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> password managers</font>

344
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,400
support this way to be presented in a in

345
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:58,699
a safari browser which is good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

346
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:01,620
the important reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

347
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:05,190
mobile and really focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile is I</font>

348
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:07,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's the way to win an argument on</font>

349
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet since that's the only place</font>

350
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:14,100
good import good important arguments are

351
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:17,250
fought with people who use people who

352
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,050
use Excel spreadsheets and and password

353
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:23,540
journals and stuff i got in an argument

354
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:27,030
with somebody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slack channel and</font>

355
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,500
this guy said he all of his passwords

356
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,940
were too sensitive for a password

357
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">manager and he could never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

358
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,740
software and he kept an<font color="#CCCCCC"> excel</font>

359
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,389
spreadsheet or he kept something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he</font>

360
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,460
wouldn't he refused<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me because</font>

361
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was too high security and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like</font>

362
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,340
first of all this is just absurd but

363
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,200
second like the mobile case the mobile

364
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,959
case just I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

365
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,520
trounces his argument because because

366
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,140
who knows where this guy will be he

367
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">might not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at home when he signs up</font>

368
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,430
for uber or for snapchat<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if he if he</font>

369
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,889
doesn't choose a good password that's

370
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:14,400
like bad password hygiene and his his

371
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:17,070
system fails so the scary part of

372
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,950
password managers is go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Apple App</font>

373
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Store and type in password manager and</font>

374
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,250
there are like hundreds of results and

375
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,850
who knows who knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

376
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,850
are doing

377
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:37,179
okay so what what what features actually

378
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,699
need security evaluation and I think

379
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,470
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all know browser</font>

380
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,470
filling logic needs security evaluation

381
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,300
integration with the between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser</font>

382
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:57,190
extension and the and whatever

383
00:19:52,300 --> 00:20:02,350
background no integration between like

384
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:05,230
what the user is doing and the how the

385
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,060
user interface talks to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backend</font>

386
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,970
system that decrypts all the passwords

387
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:13,780
because in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dashlane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and one</font>

388
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:19,620
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> its they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk over a web socket</font>

389
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:22,330
and and it's not tightly coupled like

390
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,310
different password managers all have a

391
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,820
different software architecture where

392
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,490
some are more monolithic where you might

393
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,550
they might only be extension based but

394
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:40,570
some really rely on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client on</font>

395
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:43,870
your machine crypto primitives so this

396
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is all came from browser world and</font>

397
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,969
crypto primitives don't exist that well

398
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so basically everybody</font>

399
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:55,210
just copies and pastes in crypto<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

400
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,610
crypto primitives that they need and who

401
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,140
knows who's looked at these I have no

402
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:06,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea and then HTTP headers random</font>

403
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:10,060
regular app sec kind of things so how to

404
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,640
dive in and look under the hood<font color="#CCCCCC"> were so</font>

405
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,830
the the parts you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking</font>

406
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">at is the API the crypto the browser</font>

407
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:21,340
extension and if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nap sect</font>

408
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,409
person and you've always wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font>

409
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,659
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to dive in we're about to look</font>

410
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:31,690
at it quickly so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of</font>

411
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:35,830
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could examine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the API for last</font>

412
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:37,930
pass and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so for last pass</font>

413
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,070
password box most of the monolithic

414
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,759
extensions where they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

415
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,609
client on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine</font>

416
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:48,820
lastpass does now but all the logics

417
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:52,629
still in the extension you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just go</font>

418
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:55,079
to this extension screen and chrome

419
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:57,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">chrome colon slash slash extensions and</font>

420
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,789
load up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background page and start</font>

421
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:03,279
diving in that's you have to click<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

422
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:06,459
that there's a checkbox in the top

423
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,809
corner that says enabled you have to

424
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:10,229
click that then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click back</font>

425
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:14,139
around about HTML and you can start

426
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,349
diving into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical details of how</font>

427
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:20,649
the extension communicates with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API</font>

428
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:28,359
for for a lot of extensions actually and

429
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:31,658
here is my last pass vault and you can

430
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:36,728
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the once you click background</font>

431
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:39,579
HTML it'll pop up a a chrome debugging

432
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:41,679
window and there's a network tab you

433
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:44,549
click the network tab and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

434
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the requests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are being made and</font>

435
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:50,879
you just click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

436
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:56,079
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical details it's amazing</font>

437
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:59,109
and apps that don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's a</font>

438
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:02,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">little harder to kind of dive in and</font>

439
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:04,299
reverse-engineer because you have to

440
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:08,349
reverse engineer a thick client instead

441
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:11,139
you who knows like maybe they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> H like</font>

442
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:13,479
public key pinning inside there they're

443
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:15,549
thick client and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder to</font>

444
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:19,649
dive in this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice because</font>

445
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:19,649
chrome gives you a debugger it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing</font>

446
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:26,559
next is examining the crypto and pretty

447
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:28,269
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all password managers use have</font>

448
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,349
pretty similar crypto primitives that

449
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:40,049
they've chosen most of them have chosen

450
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:47,168
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> esc bc and similar encryption and</font>

451
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:49,799
PB<font color="#CCCCCC"> kdf to sha-1 for deriving a key and i</font>

452
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:53,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is mostly because of</font>

453
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,668
difficulty getting primitives into the

454
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,549
javascript world where they might need

455
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:01,399
them

456
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:03,950
and whatever but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

457
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:07,908
best practice now is to use an aad

458
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:10,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">cipher and it's really hard one</font>

459
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:12,440
challenge that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of realize when</font>

460
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,959
you're working as a software engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

461
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,739
a password manager is let's say tomorrow

462
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,220
you wanted to switch from AES CBC mode

463
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:23,720
to a different crypto primitive let's

464
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,450
say you wanted to go way<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and way</font>

465
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:30,549
weaker and pick des which we don't use

466
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,549
anymore and please<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't ever use and</font>

467
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:37,219
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard because you start you</font>

468
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,049
can't just flip a switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody's</font>

469
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,600
passwords are encrypted with something

470
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,090
different moving moving forward is not

471
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:52,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy once you've chosen a primitive it's</font>

472
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:56,059
really sticky who said why why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

473
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:58,459
sticky just be just because so you

474
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,470
encrypt up all your all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your passwords</font>

475
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a thousand passwords in your</font>

476
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,590
vault and we chose let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pick</font>

477
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,139
something really weak des and we want to

478
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:13,009
move to aes and you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

479
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:15,678
download new code from whatever update

480
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:19,340
process the extension has and the client

481
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,159
has and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your things have to be</font>

482
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:25,428
decrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and encrypted again or you can</font>

483
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,230
wrap them and that's that's kind of

484
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:31,999
weird where you start encrypting a

485
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:35,440
ciphertext and it's it's just kind of a

486
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,440
not an easy process

487
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:05,220
yeah it's it's it's not easy and so now

488
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,040
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want authenticated encryption and</font>

489
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,080
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much no password managers have</font>

490
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,460
authenticated encryption just because of

491
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,070
this problem like if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was easy</font>

492
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,870
everybody would do it but it's not and

493
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,080
so examining the browser extension

494
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks is Tavis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ormandy he found a</font>

495
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,929
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad bug and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LastPass last week</font>

496
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:30,540
and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at more now more</font>

497
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:42,360
password managers so I put his face up

498
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:45,840
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so finally examining the browser</font>

499
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,330
extension so the part that he found the

500
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,610
bug in is in last pass was there

501
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:56,610
autofill logic and this is fairly easy

502
00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:00,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dive into because of chrome devtools</font>

503
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:03,659
again just right clicking on a page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

504
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:06,630
clicking inspect element and then you

505
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,760
can click<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you pop open the developer</font>

506
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:12,630
tools then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click sources and</font>

507
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,660
then content scripts which is right here

508
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:18,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can just browse JavaScript</font>

509
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,990
all the JavaScript<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill logic this is</font>

510
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,300
one passwords Phil logic LastPass<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phil</font>

511
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,060
logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> right next door it'll format</font>

512
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,190
everything for you it'll it's really

513
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,909
easy to dive in and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading their</font>

514
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:37,380
code and evaluating it and so out of

515
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:42,420
this talk I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of came up with an idea</font>

516
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,550
where if you've ever heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the eff</font>

517
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,680
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have created</font>

518
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">scorecards for things like encrypted</font>

519
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,720
messengers and

520
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:55,120
and what not I want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a</font>

521
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,440
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager scorecard where there</font>

522
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,928
is a lot of properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i define and</font>

523
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,919
password managers either get a green

524
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:10,679
check or a red check or red I don't know

525
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:13,690
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's called actually a red no and</font>

526
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:17,049
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this would be really useful just</font>

527
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:21,250
to have something where non-technical

528
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:24,908
users can kind of come see and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

529
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:27,700
non-biased way to evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a password</font>

530
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:30,340
manager that suits their needs and i

531
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,200
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i got this idea while I was</font>

532
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,970
working on this talk and so I have not

533
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,789
made it but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

534
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:41,820
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple weeks and work on this so</font>

535
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,799
maybe you'll see it i<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope you see it</font>

536
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">but i plan on publishing it soon so does</font>

537
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:52,960
anybody have questions sure for those of

538
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,350
us who work with users all the time

539
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,830
where will you publish it uh so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

540
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:03,399
no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare</font>

541

our PR people have good contacts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

542
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,020
was hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it somewhere that it</font>

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:12,299
might get visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> i plan on putting</font>

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:15,158
it on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter on ejc X underscore and</font>

hacker news and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter are places</font>

547
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:24,850
that you might expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it so do</font>

548
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of a personal password manager</font>

549
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:34,178
that sinks or you can run your own

server I yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pass pass which I</font>

00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:39,220

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:42,639
website for it is password store org it

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,669
is get backed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if you like gpg</font>

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,220
and command line the reason the reason i

555
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,049
recommend pass is because there's kind

556
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:55,899
of been an ecosystem built around it

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,779
get as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend and so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

at the risk of pushing of pushing

self-serving criteria I was bit

surprised at the extent to which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

downplayed the not having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URLs</font>

long time I mean I understand the

571
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:47,559
technical reasons why it's difficult to

572
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:50,228
get those encrypted and when we made the

transition to a new data format in which
