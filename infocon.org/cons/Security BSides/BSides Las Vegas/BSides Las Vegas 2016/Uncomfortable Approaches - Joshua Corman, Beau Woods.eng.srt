welcome everyone welcome to

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:09,240
uncomfortable solutions the second part

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of day to the I am the cavalry track and</font>

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,030
our last thing here oh we have closing

already in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon a source of knowledge</font>

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,210
yes and all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus right all</font>

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,150
the other sponsors there's like 30 of

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">them on the list oh we're going to be</font>

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,239
interactive in this session so i'll be

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,949
walking around with a microphone if you

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,510
want to have people hear you if you

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,309
don't want to have people hear you if

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,870
you want to say something that you do

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,940
not want public you want off the record

17
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,919
tell us and we will kill the microphones

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,120
so that nobody outside this room will

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,489
hear you and with that all said as balut

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,649
and Josh Gordon yep so while usually

21
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas it</font>

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,910
cons were they record and broadcast

23
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,620
everything that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case but we</font>

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,438
have the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring Vegas to make</font>

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:11,520
vegas stay here again or summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

coming back who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is here for this I see</font>

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,280
several familiar faces but you chose

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,119
different seats to just just to mess

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,950
with me who is here this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,509
so in the inverse who wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well</font>

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,890
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming back</font>

33
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,079
and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for coming for the first</font>

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,570
time let's do a kill me if I go longer

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,408
than six minutes don't kill me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,908
punch me hard in the arm I'll do a short

37
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280
recap of what we try to do this morning

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and how it was meant to be fuel for</font>

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,310
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do now so yesterday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of look we turned three</font>

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,780
years old this crazy mission seems are

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,430
you working so it was where we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,700
one like some victories and

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,110
accomplishments where we're winning you

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,820
know we're far from done but we're on

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,950
the right path with folks like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA</font>

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,419
with folks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitsa with some device</font>

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,610
manufacturers we're getting cording to

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,170
vulnerability disclosure culture started

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,590
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> causing a competitive need to</font>

51
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,890
copy so we're kind of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bend the</font>

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,830
arc

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,069
history today<font color="#E5E5E5"> was meant to be really</font>

54
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,240
hard problems that are overwhelming us

55
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:24,119
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wear that</font>

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,060
weight<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our shoulders and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font>

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,810
people watch us like fatigue to death

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,640
and give up and the number and<font color="#CCCCCC"> variety</font>

59
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,680
of these really hard problems are

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,690
growing so while we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great job</font>

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,720
we also want to be honest and<font color="#E5E5E5"> candid</font>

62
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,010
with you of where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,080
answers or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any good</font>

64
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,489
answers and if the morning was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,230
uncomfortable ground truths and

66
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,540
sometimes the opposite of another<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,060
truth is not a lie it's another truth

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,730
and there's tension between say the need

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,489
for privacy and medical devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cars</font>

70
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,988
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't do any logging without any</font>

71
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,570
logging we have silent failures that we

72
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,489
can't study capture and learn from for

73
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,170
forensics and for having<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence of</font>

74
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,200
proof of harm or evidence of hacking in

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,670
cars or whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our truths</font>

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,030
compete so this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about</font>

77
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing up we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a few</font>

78
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,250
incredibly overwhelming challenges we've

79
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,190
encountered that don't seem to have an

80
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious solution that was meant to</font>

81
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,160
catalyze some uncomfortable

82
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">experimentation and comfortable</font>

83
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,670
brainstorming and this is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

84
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,579
going to be a monologue it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

85
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">be we want to hear the best ideas that</font>

86
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,810
you all might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we get out of</font>

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">our comfort zone are their legislative</font>

88
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,610
responses are their regulatory responses

89
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:43,200
should we do a documentary expose you

90
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,120
know should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have you know</font>

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,798
consequence-free brainstorming we'll put

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,540
all the ideas out there they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">smart but we at least want to surface</font>

94
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,150
some of the beliefs or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your best</font>

95
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,959
ideas to rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of these</font>

96
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,250
challenges so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the spirit is when</font>

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,650
you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behind you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work much</font>

98
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,299
much harder but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're very very</font>

99
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,280
behind you have to work smarter and

100
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,480
think differently one of the best quotes

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">bo and I encountered when we went to the</font>

102
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,459
think tank because we were talking to

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,799
somebody from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany the German</font>

104
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,480
government and she had this perfect

105
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,370
phrase that I wish I had just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

106
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">with she said it's become clear to us</font>

107
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,940
that we need radically different

108
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,160
approaches to IT not little changes not

109
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,690
best practices radically different

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
approaches to IT and for those of you

111
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,530
who know me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while my rugged</font>

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,359
software stuff I rugged manifesto rugged

113
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,690
DevOps those are our ideas that said

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,950
we're

115
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,840
coming too dependent on digital

116
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,880
infrastructure that's not dependable and

117
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,210
the cavalry was really an extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to public safety human life issues</font>

119
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,630
so I agree we need radically different

120
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,010
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what I found is we have a</font>

121
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,440
lot of technical solutions that no one's

122
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,080
willing to use because the incentives

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,180
are screwed up things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no software</font>

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,560
liability things like no software supply

125
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,150
chain transparency things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most vulnerable products we</font>

127
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">have our security products things like</font>

128
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,740
compliance things that have gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,299
way certain laws meant to make

130
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare better like meaningful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use in</font>

131
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,230
some ways made us much much more exposed

132
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,210
so I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cognitive dissidence that</font>

133
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,980
on the one hand some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our biggest</font>

134
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,960
mistakes were caused by laws on the

135
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand if we don't hack the law and</font>

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,010
hack incentives and change liability

137
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,570
insurance or these other things there's

138
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,580
no reason to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up our technical</font>

139
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,530
solutions you've got things like laying

140
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">sec that are really clever from academia</font>

141
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,520
you've got things like liability ditch

142
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,049
work in other scenarios and we're just

143
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,219
too uncomfortable into conditioned to

144
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,510
think those are bad things and the

145
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,460
government can only make it worse but

146
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the the cost of inaction is</font>

147
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,200
much greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of action so</font>

148
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,859
how many minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is my end of my six</font>

149
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,530
minutes you are seven minutes in my

150
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,650
second camp math<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're four minutes</font>

151
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's a general arc is that we</font>

152
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,140
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to disestablish some really</font>

153
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,810
uncomfortable truths in the morning and

154
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,349
then use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as motivation for us to</font>

155
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,120
have a sustained experimentation on look

156
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,070
in the last 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years what really made a</font>

157
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,810
dent in security I can list a few but I

158
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to surface some from you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

159
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,290
could they may be instruct the next

160
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,630
innovations and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leapfrogs you need to do</font>

161
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,610
the analogy I used was when we needed to

162
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">we made the Manhattan Project and we</font>

163
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,370
pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> together our best and brightest</font>

164
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,280
and we figured something out to end the

165
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,800
war when we wanted to we had the space

166
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,809
race like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we put somebody in a</font>

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,120
space when we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the moonshot we</font>

168
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,860
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out but we haven't had a</font>

169
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,530
ground swell in a public consciousness

170
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,110
that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems are really severe</font>

171
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,289
and we need these grand challenges to

172
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,810
ask for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big changes radically</font>

173
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,370
different approaches to IT and then now

174
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,900
the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put up yesterday morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

175
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,650
from the Martian where he was out of

176
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">food</font>

177
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,210

on Mars but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he science the out of</font>

179
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,020
it so I want us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe science the</font>

180
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,039
 out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to be</font>

181
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,570
partly technical and partly policy and

182
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,300
some of us hate government interaction

183
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,030
on tech and cyber but let's at least

184
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,740
brainstorm what that might look like so

185
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,049
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give one of the scenarios there's</font>

186
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,789
a recap for the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't here</font>

187
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,410
I'm on the HHS<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity task force</font>

188
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,750
the Congress asked for we have 12 months

189
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,090
there's 20 of us Michael McNeely from

190
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,190
here yesterday was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the 20 we've</font>

191
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,138
got some really<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart people that are</font>

192
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,719
very overwhelmed and what I put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,400
table in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our first meetings was</font>

194
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,440
even though the FDA is doing a really

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,349
good job helping to make new medical

196
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,580
devices better and more secure the

197
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,260
clinical<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare environments are a</font>

198
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,448
disaster it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an intractable</font>

199
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,650
problem and the case example I brought

200
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,260
up was Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital

201
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,419
this spring was hit by piece of

202
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,909
ransomware for a known vulnerability in

203
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,560
jboss in a McKesson device they hit lots

204
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,849
and lots of healthcare organizations but

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their particular case they didn't pay</font>

206
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,180
the very small ransom and it affected

207
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,280
patient care it affected patient

208
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,289
delivery they had to divert ambulances

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to other facilities they almost had to</font>

210
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:59,610
move patients<font color="#CCCCCC"> into our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge no one</font>

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,870
has been hurt but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> probability of</font>

212
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,199
people getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> hurt with a sustained</font>

213
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,120
denial of service a patient care is the

214
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,039
reason I left my private sector job to

215
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,800
try to go further into public policy

216
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,630
work and accelerate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cure and what I</font>

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,250
posed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as I said what if if that</font>

218
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,940
was an accident where ransomware

219
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,220
accidentally hit patient care what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

220
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,419
someone is there any technical barrier

221
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,090
to someone deliberately taking out

222
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,070
plural hospitals and what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do if</font>

223
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">they did will we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in an</font>

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour a day a week some months and we</font>

225
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,659
looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> near-term midterm and</font>

226
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,270
long-term solutions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're terrible</font>

227
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,069
like years of changes to rotate out the

228
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,838
bad and indefensible supply chain and

229
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,279
devices in these clinical environments

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,169
and worse even when we gave them new

231
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,120
stuff they admitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't have the</font>

232
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:49,980
budget or the stomach to get rid of

233
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,410
their old XP systems right so if that's

234
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,569
a ground truth an uncomfortable truth

235
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,649
there's really no technical barrier

236
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:58,800
someone has the means motive and

237
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,440
opportunity to do significant damage on

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,910
public trust crisis of confidence in our

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,350
ability to have health care delivery and

240
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically if you combine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font>

241
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,279
something the Boston Marathon attack

242
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,378
where there was several injured people

243
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,970
who luckily were saved because they were

244
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,100
blocks away from from the best hospitals

245
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,379
in the world where you to add something

246

as simple is this readily reproducible

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem in 100 of the fortune</font>

if you didn't see any of this two things

made me want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quit my private sector</font>

job and go further into this Hollywood

Presbyterian kind of is we knew they

were vulnerable that I think it

vulnerable we really were and I see a

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,559
gold rush effect where people once they

292
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,878
see weakness they exploit it repeatedly

293
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,769
it's like when openssl heartbleed

294
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,459
happened you had 31 other bugs found

295
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,360
that same year and the second thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

296
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,369
when I research

anonymous with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jericho we did the</font>

298
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,060
building a better anonymous series we

299
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,459
tracked very few hacking actual hackers

300
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,170
and anonymous that knew what to do and

301
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to do it and one of them left team</font>

radicalized he joined Isis he helped

305
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,839
start the cyber caliphate he was

306
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,099
recruiting and training people to use

307
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">showed an to use free attack tools and</font>

308
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,529
when we know that these systems are

309
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,000
directly connected the internet we know

310
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,220
they have hard-coded default passwords

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,720
we know that all you need is the motive

312
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,470
because the means and opportunity are

313
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,140
already there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination of more</font>

314
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,029
visible exposure and people willing to

315
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,630
hurt us is what is bothering me and why

316
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:53,279
we trust you to have this candid

317
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,990
brainstorming conversation so we can get

318
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,550
try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of this but the</font>

319
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">truth is even if we had the will to do</font>

320
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,469
something tomorrow it'll take 10-15

321
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,959
years to actually clean up our technical

322
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,110
debt here and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty certain</font>

323
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,029
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years to to win this</font>

324
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,029
foot race so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much preparedness can</font>

325
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:14,130
we do between now and a competent

326
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,390
shattering attack so that's a little

327
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the top it's because I had to</font>

328
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,079
convince a whole morning in 29 minutes

329
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,469
but keep in mind that we have means

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">motive and opportunity and we've got to</font>

331
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of some radically different things</font>

332
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,209
so I think everything's on the table

333
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,860
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what did we do like d'Epinay SLR</font>

334
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,589
that really took out large classes of

335
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,640
attacks in the past which things can

336
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,490
work when you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

337
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,649
staff which things might require

338
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,120
legislative reliability changes which

339
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:44,160
things might require an exposé

340
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,680
documentary that shows how bad things

341
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,089
are is there some sort of grants or

342
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,399
government grand challenge we could

343
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,730
stimulate everything's on the table but

344
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't want a monologue so how should</font>

345
00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:00,630
we pivot from that to now lots of hands

346
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,250
that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and reminder if</font>

347
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,589
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to shut off the camera this is</font>

348
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,970
valuable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for posterity but if you want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to shut up family will pause it</font>

350
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:19,360
nothing works better than a demo right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

351
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,250
mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a forcing function to help</font>

352
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain people understand that this</font>

353
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:28,450
actually is a potential reality right

354
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,209
the the stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood pres is I</font>

355
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,490
think a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo but we need other</font>

356
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,270
demos for these people to help them

357
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,410
understand now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in terms of</font>

358
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,579
smaller places or places that don't have

359

security people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have security</font>

budget especially the medical sector

361
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,290
what about stuff like a fire drill I

362
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:49,420
mean you go back and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

363
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,480
power were to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this hospital</font>

364
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,370
what would you do right<font color="#CCCCCC"> if your</font>

365
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,750
infrastructure especially certain

366
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,250
services were to go out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you</font>

367
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,550
do do you have backup systems in place

368
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,620
do you have paper and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pencils and things</font>

369
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,780
that you would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle these sort</font>

370
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,870
of situations if power went out what

371
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,490
would you do if if certain IT systems

372
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,990
were to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

373
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably set some ground rules as well</font>

374
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,880
Bo and I know certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

375
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,070
already done or being done but we're

376
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to withhold some of those so we</font>

377
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,370
can get the juices flowing for a little

378
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,450
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> well pepper them in when we slow</font>

379
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:28,750
down yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have we as an</font>

380
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:33,160
industry have a long and storied history

381
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:36,100
of creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> short-term solutions that</font>

382
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,300
make things harder in the long term<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

383
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the examples you great</font>

384
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,469
you that you gave but five<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes ago</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speech was was an excellent</font>

386
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,230
example sure we create the atomic bomb

387
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,630
to end the World War two but then we

388
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">started nuclear armament for the rest of</font>

389
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:54,520
the world right<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the next 60 years</font>

390
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,470
we created a we created a solution to

391
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,480
solve a short-term problem because we

392
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,130
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kill 200,000 people or</font>

393
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,470
possibly up to a million soldiers which

394
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:06,760
is what the Army's estimates were it was

395
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take to invade Japan um but I</font>

396
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,680
think that whatever solution that we

397
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,750
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with we have to remember that we</font>

398
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,479
can't it can't be short-sighted it can't

399
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,010
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this is the problems that</font>

400
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,920
we're seeing now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how is that</font>

401
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,860
solution going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to react to and be</font>

reacted to

403
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,760
how's that solution going to be placed

404
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,650
in future situations which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

405
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,540
we're very bad at doing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we often</font>

406
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">lay our technology on top of technology</font>

407
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,930
on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology and then before you</font>

408
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,370
know it five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road we</font>

409
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,319
don't have just one stack the defending

410
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,550
to defend we have 12 stacks to defend

411
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,720
each with their own individual

412
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,630
vulnerabilities our own individual

413
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,920
exploits our own individual in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it is</font>

414
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,790
synchronous and everything else like

415
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so I think that to flip this around</font>

416
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:58,730
into the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I honestly think that</font>

417
00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:01,840
in many cases non technological

418
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,940
solutions can fix technological problems

419
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,350
I mean everyone says kiss and sometimes

420
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,230
it applies sometimes it doesn't know

421
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,330
keep it simple a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times it's more</font>

422
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,890
complicated than that to be stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

423
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:23,150
it but there's a lot of solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

424
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:27,710
well the your example where an air gap

425
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,360
system or going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manual will go</font>

426
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,280
back to narrow gap system that are that

427
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
requires manual updating and doesn't

428
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,860
have to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">updates or to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware updates or to</font>

430
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,870
talk to the vendor or anything else like

431
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,030
that which may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

432
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,350
know the course the common the common

433
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,939
issues with that are well then they

434
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">never get updated because some dude has</font>

to go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a USB stick or</font>

436
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,800
something else like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means</font>

437
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the device has a USB Drive and if</font>

438
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,069
you have physical access data those are

439
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,710
problems that we know about introducing

440
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,870
devices that can connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

441
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,640
with all new levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of firmware software</font>

442
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,970
introduces vulnerabilities we don't know

443
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,800
about yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe this</font>

444
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,260
may be part of the solution is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devil</font>

445
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,730
we know versus the devil we don't know

446
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,710
yeah I do think if you didn't hear this

447
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,660
in last couple days our dependence claim

448
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,160
on the cavalry mission was our

449
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,450
dependence on Connecticut technologies

450
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,130
growing faster our ability to secure it

451
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,280
and that implies if you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend</font>

452
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,930
upon it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can depend upon it less so</font>

453
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,069
there's there's plural options one of

454
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,440
them is there certainly be certain use

455
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:31,399
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are wildly inappropriate to</font>

456
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,930
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to the Internet yeah so</font>

457
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,970
there were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple things packed into</font>

458
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,040
his comments and one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't</font>

459
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,370
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about at this stage maybe we'll</font>

460
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,290
worry about in the second half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

461
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block don't worry about the law of</font>

462
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,309
unintended consequences it's it's a

463
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">given we can make things worse in fact</font>

464
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,530
you've ever been involved in a breach

465
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,210
it's not the breach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kills you it's</font>

466
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,540
your bad response to it that kills you

467
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,580
so yes Lobban unintended consequences we

468
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,620
should measure twice cut once all those

469
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are true really we're looking to</font>

470
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,340
surface ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if they're bad</font>

471
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,699
because there may be a nugget of truth

472
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a bad idea so let's just rapid fire</font>

473
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,690
whoever was next<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so this is a</font>

474
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,889
clarifying question when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said</font>

475
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,590
there's are there are devices that have

476
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,990
1400 vulnerabilities are you referring

477
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,850
to like medical devices like a pacemaker

478
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,960
or are you referring to e records

479
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,520
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think those may be two</font>

480
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,490
separate problems with different

481
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,440
solutions so yeah there's a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

482
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,850
devices each with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels of</font>

483
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,260
attack surface each of different levels

484
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,719
of complexity and code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating</font>

485
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,420
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was not a pacemaker okay</font>

486
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,070
yeah II records I think like the

487
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,200
low-tech solution is probably better

488
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,879
like they hate the electronic records

489
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,320
that people like like their doctors you

490
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and they have like office stuff and</font>

491
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,809
like their job is not IT so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

492
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like H&R Block for taxes where</font>

493
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:47,940
it's like they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send copies of their</font>

494
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,590
files to this central office and like

495
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,110
they they deal with it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

496
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,139
people like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new cyber task force</font>

497
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that fixed Obamacare why isn't there</font>

498
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:03,450
something to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> like medical records</font>

499
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:04,470
right who's next reminder you can feel

500
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,480
free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out things that have</font>

501
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,000
worked in enterprise IT that had a big

502
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,950
impact as well right at master the

503
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,980
gentleman who was speaking about fire

504
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,360
drills how would we go about enforcing

505
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,900
to hospitals it's supposed to be a

506
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">dialogue yes how do we go about having</font>

507
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,490
these people who would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-selected</font>

508
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,710
why would why would I is a as a hospital

509
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:32,040
practitioner decide to join your fire

510
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:33,330
drill what's my business incentive yeah

511
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,250
that was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first part of the</font>

512
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,659
comment which was we need some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

513
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,010
forcing function to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these people to</font>

514
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,250
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this actually is a</font>

515
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,770
problem right demos right have have

516
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,710
people that know how to exploit these

517
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,710
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that are in the room be</font>

518
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,570
able to go into these places and exploit

519
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems with an easy</font>

520
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">back door or you know go in there and</font>

521
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:01,710
just just do a port scan and shut stuff

522
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:03,810
down one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

523
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,910
hospital one at the time in order to to

524
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,429
demonstrate that they're vulnerable one

525
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,690
at a time when there are millions I know

526
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,020
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many hospitals there are but</font>

527
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:16,080
millions of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was right I can't we</font>

528
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,570
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure to do that</font>

529
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:23,939
so I don't know that that's a viable

530
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:25,050
solution maybe so we don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck on</font>

531
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,430
this one even though it's a great one

532
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,570
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have some ideas that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

533
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:32,940
holding back let me put that experience

534
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,220
into may be an incentive structure so if

535
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,240
for certain publicly traded companies

536
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,610
they have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

537
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,560
continuity disaster recovery annual

538
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,590
tabletop exercises and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

539
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,510
a play for things like hurricane or an

540
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,919
outbreak or this or that and and

541
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,680
hospitals do this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well they already</font>

542
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,140
do drills for things like the sustained

543
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,670
power outage so yeah it wouldn't just be

544
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience could</font>

545
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,220
help it might be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

546
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirement to have a cyber play in your</font>

547
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,810
certification or your insurability from

548
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,790
your underwriter so try to connect the

549
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,490
technical and the incentive whether it's

550
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,580
government incentive insurance incentive

551
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,350
but I like where you're starting but

552
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,070
let's expand it to all sorts of levers

553
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,169
yeah um I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada we had an</font>

554
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,060
election last year and I was

555
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,490
coordinating the security for that and

556
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,169
so like six or eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> months before what</font>

557
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,600
we did is we actually had a pretend

558
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,310
election like we opened an office we

559
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,530
hired people we gave them the training

560
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,409
and then we through lots of security

561
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:37,770
incidents at them like jerks and then

562
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:40,890
saw how badly we did on some things and

563
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,840
then got way better very quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

564
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,660
now they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an entire</font>

565
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,879
simulation every year so that it's like

566
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,470
a smooth machine for the junior<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

567
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,060
mean and like I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe how</font>

568
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,630
much we learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a simulation and I</font>

569
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:57,450
don't know how to motivate a hospital to

570
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,340
do that but like like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

571
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,620
practice before you go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on stage and</font>

572
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,480
play music right like you should

573
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,979
practice for bad stuff too I mean our

574
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,840
kids have to do a fire drill before they

575
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,120
you know right they know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

576
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,740
when there's a fire you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand</font>

577
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,139
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that you're</font>

578
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,610

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you guys are hitting on the</font>

580
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,330
right path and everything that's the

581
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,250
rules of the world that's where the game

582
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,689
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be changed a lot I think</font>

583
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,059
there's another opportunity that we

584
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:31,200
should look for a visit with a lot of

585
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">see suites level type people and have</font>

586
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,040
for years<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 plus years healthcare IT</font>

587
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,559
and security so what I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot is</font>

588
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,780
a real reluctance even those are several

589
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,580
people might be identified as the

590
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,428
accountable person that's either signing

591
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,080
off on an attestation or whatever

592
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:50,490
there's an opportunity there to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

593
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,428
something that's a little more dear to

594
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,610
them and that's their money ok so if

595
00:22:53,429 --> 00:23:01,169
their boards or they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to see</font>

596
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:03,330
their bonuses or we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change in</font>

597
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,240
policy that requires them to meet

598
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,370
certain requirements before they can get

599
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,309
their bonus I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might start to</font>

600
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,770
have an effect on<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT spend and then IT</font>

601
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,570
security spend and they might get a

602
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,330
little bit more interested in the

603
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,149
problem so that's that's a stick

604
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:26,370
approach right a beer of penalty there

such as American Hospital Association

633
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,310
aaha that brings together that's where

634
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,100
you're able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that scalability of</font>

different trade organizations among

638
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,980

participate in the play of those

640

how do we recover from that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

653
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,850
wanted to share also<font color="#E5E5E5"> really kind of an</font>

654
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,920
important anecdote that once was said to

655
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,590
me by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's the assistant</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">secretary for preparedness response the</font>

657
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:50,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">a spur and that's rear admiral Laurie</font>

658
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,669
who has said we exercise to failure not

659
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,730
to futility but to failure the whole

660
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:59,640
point of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise is to stress the</font>

661
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,260
system to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we don't pat</font>

662
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,060
ourselves on the back afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

663
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,590
well we did everything really really

664
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,649
great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got it all together but</font>

665
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather where are the gaps where are the</font>

666
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:13,260
learnings that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to need to</font>

667
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:18,050
fill in to assure that people patients

668
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,760
do not get hurt and not to lose our

669
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense of confidence so not to futility</font>

670
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,560
but to failure and then you iterate on

671
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,830
that and you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on showing that up</font>

672
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:31,860
with new situations yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

673
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,960
blueprint exists but thus far we have it

674
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,320
folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done a cyber exercise</font>

675
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,429
that that affected patient life they may

676
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">have happened we just haven't</font>

677
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,720
encountered many and if they have

678
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,460
happened I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're have</font>

679
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,460
reached the whole ecosystem yet

680
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,970
yeah so we dig without saying more than

681
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I probably should we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a readout</font>

682
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,530
of cyber storm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 it did involve some</font>

683
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,540
pretty key people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Industry ecosystem</font>

684
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:11,330
and they did involve some<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font>

685
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,500
injects if you're familiar with how

686
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,830
these things work it's like a captain

687
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like a CCDC type thing but none of</font>

688
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:23,629
the injects involved any loss of life so

689
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:25,850
to the point of stressing we're sort of

690
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:30,470
working on something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

691
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,790
great demo and stressor simulation with

692
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,380
the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stakeholders to maybe</font>

693
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,450
catalyze some action so that's a great

694
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's probably other ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

695
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,900
well but simulation is a good topic area

696
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,520
and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've observed</font>

697
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:45,790
as we're trying to go through these is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

698
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,590
was walking through something with

699
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,850
colleague of ours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were saying</font>

700
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,510
well what we need to do is to get

701
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:55,010
insurers to go do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well why now</font>

702
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,290
we've got to go convince insurers how do

703
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,270
we convince ensures well they're

704
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,280
convinced by this innocent it and you

705
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,650
start pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the those threads until</font>

706
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,129
you find the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bedrock right</font>

707
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,020
what are they in internally incentivized

708
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,910
to go do what's their intrinsic

709
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,030
motivation once you find an intrinsic

710
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,800
motivation at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> it becomes a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a job of awareness how do</font>

712
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,490
you make them aware of that then you

713
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,919
unlock them to just go do that work for

714
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:27,050
you right Milo<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I have the mic i'm</font>

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,180
of your yearly revenue so that means

723
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:50,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

724
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to secure your site when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

725
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,140
breached and they are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

726
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,300
on it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the law and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

727
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,780
i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if it will work for for</font>

728
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:02,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">america but yeah that's that's the</font>

729
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,620
problem but you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you</font>

730
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,300
have to state that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've done enough</font>

731
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,510
for what you can do so that means

732
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,309
penetration tests firewall etc and if

733
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,170
you have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in place and and</font>

734
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:22,200
we're updated then you cannot get

735
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:25,680
defined yeah that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

736
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:31,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's a start and it also affects a</font>

737
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,210
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hospitals in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Netherlands hmm</font>

738
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,010
yeah that's that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's</font>

739
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,429
great it's gross you repeat some of that

740
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,850
for the put people online so his point

741
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:43,290
about privacy I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there thanks I</font>

742
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,750
just noted that that's the EU privacy

743
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,149
and it's again it's focused on privacy

744
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,590
and oftentimes focus on privacy diverts

745
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,620
our attention from security denial of

746
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:55,770
service so you can fully meet the EU

747
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,510
regulation which you still need<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

748
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">still don't have to do for two years and</font>

749
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,580
be completely exposed from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

750
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,860
concern yeah I said something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might</font>

751
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,909
not as should have said this bluntly if

752
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:11,159
he's next um at a Detroit event like a

753
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,690
week and a half ago I was kind of

754
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,830
pointing out that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

755
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,630
advocates might be getting the way of

756
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary evidence capture and I</font>

757
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't I had a sticker I pulled out of</font>

758
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">my pocket he said I love privacy but the</font>

759
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,629
old joke we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make was you know to</font>

760
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,760
thought provoke was I love my privacy

761
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,320
I'd like to be live to enjoy it but I

762
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,510
took it a step further in Detroit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

763
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,520
said I don't want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a situation</font>

764
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we have a corpse with its privacy</font>

765
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,830
intact right so these these are truths

766
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,780
competing truths that both matter and

767
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,490
they both matter differently in

768
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,990
different contexts that have to be

769
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,890
resolved one cannot nominate the other I

770
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:51,360
just said it again so I guess I didn't

771
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,550
regret it that much ok your turn here so

772
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,678
i think it's every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years or something</font>

773
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,790
the Army Corps<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Engineers goes around</font>

774
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,490
America and looks at critical

775
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:02,940
infrastructure bridges highways key

776
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:05,100
systems dams and they give a rating our

777
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,710
infrastructures at a C+ or it's at a D

778
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,780
and we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of years where we've</font>

779
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,880
gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad reports bridges are</font>

780
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,649
rated DS they need to rebuilt there was

781
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,240
one I think was at Minnesota that

782
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,460
basically collapsed and that bridge was

783
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,429
known to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like I was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a d-minus</font>

784
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,590
rating

785
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,090
and we have this you know the government

786
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">is already going on giving these ratings</font>

787
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,110
ratings to critical infrastructure as it

788
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,700
is and we're still not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> any action</font>

789
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,959
with it so I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

790
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,759
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's even if we figure out</font>

791
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to identify where there are these</font>

792
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,019
weaknesses and infrastructure maybe

793
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,730
every time a hospital's closed down and

794
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:38,919
a new ones open I know Stanford's doing

795
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,049
this soon in<font color="#E5E5E5"> California they will paint</font>

796
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,309
brand new hospital why not go in there

797
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,720
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this is all the</font>

798
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:46,090
existing infrastructure is probably in

799
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,889
most other hospitals of its age let's go

800
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,350
in and run like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a disaster scenario over</font>

801
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:52,389
a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's have patience of this</font>

802
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">level of life you know simulate it and</font>

803
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:55,928
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through what an attack would look</font>

804
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,909
like just to give a ranking of like okay

805
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">well this is like a baseline of what we</font>

806
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:02,049
have in this environment like how would

807
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">it score and readiness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

808
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:04,480
someone mentioned it let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

809
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,149
springboard off this a little bit

810
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,909
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned a stick right some</font>

811
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,110
fine for getting it wrong one of the

812
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">things go and I have talked about is</font>

813
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,129
there are certain hospitals that want to

814
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,869
be the exemplar the most cutting-edge

815
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:18,369
the best and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most connected in the world</font>

816
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,590
is one in Canada that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to mind i</font>

817
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,449
think was like hummer river or something

818
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that where it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most connected</font>

819
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,499
hospital in<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada when we talked to</font>

820
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,119
some people in thinking you buy that

821
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:32,440
want to have incredibly world-class

822
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting-edge technology one thing you</font>

823
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,559
can do is you can punish failure and

824
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,389
point out fail another thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

825
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,908
is we can do a reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture we</font>

826
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:42,340
can go in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground floor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and try</font>

827
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:44,889
to design a more defensible experiment

828
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,600
that others could emulate because one of

829
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:49,479
the things we said yesterday is there's

830
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,119
this classic story of the Cuyahoga River

831
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,220
in Ohio that<font color="#E5E5E5"> caught on fire many times</font>

832
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,049
and nobody did anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

833
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,269
it was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cover of Time magazine I</font>

834
00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,070
think but you got a burning river of

835
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:03,669
fire to show how bad the pollution was

836
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,619
an industrial runoff was and sometimes

837
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:07,149
is going to take that so for sake of

838
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,249
argument let's say we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait for</font>

839
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:11,678
our burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> River on fire moment for</font>

840
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:13,720
clinical environments what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the</font>

841
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">next day right because we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have a</font>

842
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,220
knee-jerk response and sometimes that

843
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,019
response will make things much worse so

844
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,019
liberate yourself from the idea that

845
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:26,580
maybe we can even stop these things but

846
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:29,200
what's the recommended after action plan

847
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,429
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right who's next all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you're</font>

848
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,250
after him okay are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

849
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,900
yeah um just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to think</font>

850
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,660
laterally here I spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my time</font>

851
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:41,780
in operations that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm Lane my</font>

852
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">primary focus security secondary and one</font>

853
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,860
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spend a lot of time</font>

854
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,900
mulling over is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure</font>

855
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,520
availability what does it mean to be you

856
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,080
know in systems what's up time right is

857
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,910
it when a customer comes to make a

858
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,409
request did you satisfy what I'm but

859
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,210
maybe that's another lens to look at

860
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,180
this thing through like if if half of

861
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,640
your infrastructure is down due to an

862
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,530
exploit or a defect or a flaw then your

863
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,540
capacity has diminished and you can

864
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,910
measure over time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you've got</font>

865
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,699
a hundred beds and you can only

866
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,040
effectively use 52 of them but you know

867
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a month at a time that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way of</font>

868
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,520
quantifying you know the posture and the

869
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,140
particular arrangement of an actual

870
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,120
Hospital installations like you know

871
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:26,389
find some way of measuring yeah you may

872
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,850
have a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> beds but on a given day</font>

873
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,859
odds are you might not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

874
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,630
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than fifty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and that</font>

875
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,370
be a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> characterizing the problem</font>

876
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,290
and providing way to do an

877
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,850
apples-to-apples comparison between

878
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,340
different organizations say who's doing

879
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,110
better who's doing worse you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

880
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,600
have some metric to measure progress

881
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,280
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I think operational metrics</font>

882
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,310
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary why don't we stay on</font>

883
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this side just for the mic movement and</font>

884
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,259
then we'll go right that too I'm sorry

885
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:57,139
the in dev ops for example they measure

886
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,940
mean time between failure and mean time

887
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> respond or restore services so they</font>

888
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,590
have the MTT are things like that I

889
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,060
think there are already some of those in

890
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,130
clinical environments and we would only

891
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know under a sustained attack what this</font>

892
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,490
looks like but if we aren't measuring it

893
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,060
we can't manage it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is your point</font>

894
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:18,129
all right real fast and then yep so I

895
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,570
have three quick points Oh first one is

896
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,450
nhi<font color="#E5E5E5"> sac the national health information</font>

897
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,460

901
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,260
do is create these utilities for

and you share that through the shared

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,170
assessments platform any other energy I

911
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">psych member can go pick up that shared</font>

912
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,720
assessment instead of doing their own

913
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,460
independent assessment of that third

914
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,740
party could use that if they if they you

915

know meets their standards the second is

916
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,899
a pen testing service so using the power

00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,480
pen testing services at a much more

920

affordable rate for HD OS and such

921
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,030
whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they went on their own the</font>

922
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,620
price might be twenty percent higher

923
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,420
there's an opportunity for a more

924
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective option there so there's</font>

925
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,700
more that they want that they're

926
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,440
planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

927

recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced to try to help some</font>

in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> space the second one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's</font>

929
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,759
a group called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare alliance that's a newer group</font>

931
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,390
that formed this year and they going to

932
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,319
kind of circles for what actually is

933
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,299
going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it but they're</font>

934
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,890
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create somewhat of what josh</font>

935
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is handy reference architecture per se</font>

936
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,650
where they're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all these</font>

937
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,360
different categories of security and

938
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,280
trying to create a scoring system and

939
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,800
where it's been heading right now is to

940
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,540
use that scoring system for your own

941
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,280
internal assessment kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

942
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,020
capability maturity model assessment

943
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,390
where you take the scoring system rate

944
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,980
your organization and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

945
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,420
where where it goes we're not sure yet

946
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,040
but if that gets fed up as just an

947
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,650
anonymous data then you can take

948
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,960
benchmarks on the average HDO sits here

949
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,490
the average medical device company sits

950
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,580
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can rate yourself based on</font>

951
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,600
that it's very it's kind of in the

952
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">grassroots right now still early stages</font>

953
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looking to get there the the</font>

954
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Third Point was one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard last</font>

955
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,040
night that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought was pretty</font>

956
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,080
interesting and the analogy I put in my

957
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,020
head on the sports<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy so apologize for</font>

958
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,700
the sports analogy here is in many of

959
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,800
the professional<font color="#E5E5E5"> sports they do revenue</font>

960
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,950
sharing so there was an issue years ago

961
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,840
where smaller NFL or professional

962
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,120
baseball teams or such couldn't compete

963
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,680
with the ones that made all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money</font>

964
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that were in the big markets so they</font>

965
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,370
created a pool of money where they

966
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,779
revenue share to the smaller teams had

967
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,600
the opportunity to compete by getting

968
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,040
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this extra money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

969
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,210
saying we'd say hospitals you have to

970
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,710
take a percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your money and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

971
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this pot and everybody can use it</font>

972
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> along those lines if there's some</font>

973
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,240
centralized pool of money that the HD OS

974
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,280
can use whether it's a fund for anybody

975
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,379
whether it's incentives whether its tax

976
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,119
breaks for something to try and maintain

977
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,990
your cyber security level

978
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,099
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different way of</font>

979
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,470
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind</font>

980
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,749
of unique and I could see<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

981
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,598
that feeding into insurability or

982
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">wristbands once there is a need for that</font>

983
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,779
insurability but there's no liability

984
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:16,950
yet for some of this yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> here thank you</font>

985
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:19,559
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your patience I'm some more thinking</font>

986
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,839
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network right now so</font>

987
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:23,249
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security engineer there so one of</font>

988
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,078
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing we're</font>

989
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:26,700
kicking off right now is a

990
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,190
prioritization level for biomedical

991
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,288
devices because we have lots of them and

992
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,650
we have more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> we probably know about</font>

993
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we don't know the impact right right</font>

994
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,930
so but it occurred to us that we work

995
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a lot of doctors who do so what</font>

996
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,410
we're doing is starting off with table

997
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:46,380
top exercises where we go through like

998
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,819
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a patient with this and then we</font>

999
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">just run through the checklist of all</font>

1000
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:52,049
the devices they hit and then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1001
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,210
hit one that we know we can do something

1002
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:56,009
for that we just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what do you do</font>

1003
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,059
if this device isn't there and some of

1004
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,499
its well I grab the other one over there

1005
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:01,499
and then it's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's not connected</font>

1006
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:04,379
and you know so but then you know we're

1007
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:06,029
starting to hit points where like like

1008
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,759
pharmacy systems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if this one</font>

1009
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:10,049
is malfunctioning well you know then the

1010
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:11,849
nurses got to do this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what if</font>

1011
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:13,349
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> functioning for everybody and</font>

1012
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,910
they say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to start you</font>

1013
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,410
know scaling back on the amounts that we

1014
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,089
can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we push through so</font>

1015
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,220
many we got start pulling people on

1016
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,499
staff and so with that we're able to

1017
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,470
start make a prioritization list of

1018
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:27,269
devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to look at and see</font>

1019
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:30,118
how we can better improve our defense

1020
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:33,359
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategies for that because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1021
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,829
because like logging if we could get

1022
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,140
logging just to be able to know what's

1023
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:39,480
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with these devices and like</font>

1024
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,930
because we get like you know some

1025
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,480
vendors are great some<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors are just</font>

1026
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,239
horrible and a lot more horrible ones

1027
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,999
than good ones right now and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1028
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,950
help that you mean horrible at logging

1029
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:54,720
horrible I'd just support right so like

1030
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,419
like it's been pretty well known for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1031
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,578
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you know FDA said like no put</font>

1032
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,319
your security patches on your thing but

1033
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:03,450
you know still got you know people

1034
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:05,940
running MRI machines they say oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1035
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to patch it they say no way but when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1036
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">got buildings that are built around</font>

1037
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:12,350
pieces of equipment

1038
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,520
you know it makes it hard for me to say

1039
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:18,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's the potential of this</font>

1040
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,190
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it you know so if we get</font>

1041
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,470
logging in there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin with as</font>

1042
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,910
you know or some kind of framework where

1043
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,200
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even keep it on the device</font>

1044
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put it out to a syslog server</font>

1045
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,319
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like a reference</font>

1046
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,790
framework we could have some kind of

1047
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,280
reference framework says you segment

1048
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:34,080
this way you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of you know</font>

1049
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,330
syslog server setup that you can ingest

1050
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,360
and then export that to some kind of sim

1051
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:42,060
analytics type tool that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great</font>

1052
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,920
and to point out I mean they're lucky to

1053
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a team that knows what segmentation</font>

1054
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,180
is and knows it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a security xperia</font>

1055
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,290
and you know like like I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

1056
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,419
healthcare<font color="#E5E5E5"> network we have several</font>

1057
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:56,690
hospitals at work for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm a team</font>

1058
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,590
of three right so while we're on this

1059
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,300
one of the things that came up in the

1060
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,620
task force was when we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1061
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,270
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how we close this gap what</font>

1062
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,220
are the big levers and they said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1063
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,710
can't afford a CISO because all the good

1064
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,209
ones go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to banks and I said what if the</font>

1065
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,400
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidized you can give you a</font>

1066
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,170
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> c is 0 for 3 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> h do a</font>

1067
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,710
health delivery organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

1068
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">joking and they said yeah the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

1069
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,550
problem is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't enough we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1070
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough Cisco's on the planet just</font>

1071
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,750
so there's a strategic workforce

1072
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:26,970
shortage into a gym rels credit at the

1073
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,250
nhi sac he's also on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FSI sac which</font>

1074
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,930
is the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> services one and he's</font>

1075
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">been encouraging people that retire from</font>

1076
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:35,040
banks to add two more years to their

1077
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,860
career to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go work in a hospital to at</font>

1078
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,210
least pull some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their experience it's</font>

1079
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,890
a clever idea right it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

1080
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:45,030
yes her and some do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it longer but yeah</font>

1081
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,589
there's a there's a real strategic

1082
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,420
workforce shortage to which is part of

1083
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,270
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm concerned so they're</font>

1084
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:54,410
lucky to have you who's next I didn't

1085
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,410
see right

1086
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:01,340
to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first point sir it's just trying</font>

1087
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to maybe flush that idea at a bit more</font>

1088
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,450
is there are the hospital the people

1089
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,029
making the purchase orders for

1090
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,040
specialized equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> at hospitals</font>

1091
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:12,350
whoever those guys are do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1092
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,360
access to the data of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

1093
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,069
vendors so say I'm trying to purchase<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1094
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,560
mir machine for my hospital and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

1095
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,650
a tech guy I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a hospital MRI</font>

1096
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,509
purchaser guy do I have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1097
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:26,300
data about which ones more secure how do

1098
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,910
i do they have access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now and if</font>

1099
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:38,210
not what's being done to use that data

1100
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:39,319
in an intelligent way so well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1101
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,550
preface for those who weren't here

1102
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,480
yesterday i'm colin morgan i work at

1103
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,570
johnson & johnson some of the

1104
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">manufacturers side but so my</font>

1105
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,490
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the goal where</font>

1106
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,200
they're headed they want to be able to

1107
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,910
have that information shared so for

1108
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,350
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we do third-party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1109
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,960
vendors have our tools we do a full

1110
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,160
comprehensive evaluation of them but

1111
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that's ours we don't share that</font>

1112
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">with anybody and most other</font>

1113
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,020
organizations do the same thing we

1114
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,580
constantly hear from vendors you know

1115
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,660
you guys are asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to fill this</font>

1116
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,770
questionnaire we just had five other

1117
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,020
companies last week asked us the same

1118
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,759
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their questionnaires and so</font>

1119
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,250
there's a there's an assessment overload

1120
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,750
from both the vendor side plus the

1121
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,610
hospital side the manufacturer side

1122
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,930
we're all asking the same questions a

1123
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit different way to the same</font>

1124
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,190
companies and really what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value of</font>

1125
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,290
that if we're all using a vendor for the

1126
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,580
same purpose can't we find a common

1127
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,100
ground and ask the same sets of

1128
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:28,250
questions and get the right information

1129
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:30,080
can we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ssae 16 or PCI</font>

1130
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,240
assessment which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally</font>

1131
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust them but is there something some</font>

1132
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,790
middle ground where we can trust

1133
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,080
components to that share that

1134
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,880
information out and if there's something

1135
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,500
above and beyond we want to know well

1136
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">them we can ask those questions</font>

1137
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:52,819
so we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about having some sort</font>

1138
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,500
of say organization that just says all

1139
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different here's here's a list of</font>

1140
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,950
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different like I is an</font>

1141
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,620
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm dedicated to providing</font>

1142
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,759

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment out there</font>

1144
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,380
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have one section full of hackers</font>

1145
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:08,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just spoke focus on MRIs they go</font>

1146
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,720
out and they audit all the MRIs provide

1147
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,460
