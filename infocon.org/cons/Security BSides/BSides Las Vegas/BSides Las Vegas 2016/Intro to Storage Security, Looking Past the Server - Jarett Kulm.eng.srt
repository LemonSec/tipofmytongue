00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,730
knowledge so today we're having a talk

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,840
on intro to storage system security by

<font color="#E5E5E5">derek calm please join me in welcoming</font>

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:33,149
welcoming Jared good morning I'm Jarrett

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,480
some of you might know me from Twitter

11
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,399
IRC very active on freenode<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for a</font>

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,349
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> called high availability Inc we</font>

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,629
were formerly known as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a che storage</font>

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,360
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have about 20 years of</font>

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,579
industry experience from everything from

<font color="#E5E5E5">small business enterprise and national</font>

defense so when I was younger I really

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,660
got into<font color="#E5E5E5"> security simply from Star Wars</font>

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,489
seeing how poorly a giant Empire did

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,800
things so you'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of references</font>

21
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,538
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in here and I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,900
watching this on the stream because I'm

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,408
expensing a lot of stuff this week and

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,290
he needs kudos so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should we care</font>

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,540
about storage security well your data is

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,700
the lifeblood<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your company and data</font>

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,939
loss and disasters cost us one point

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,860
seven trillion dollars annually few

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,289
companies actually have staff properly

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,450
trained on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the storage systems that they</font>

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,490
use and you'd think that companies would

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,500
put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more effort into what</font>

34
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on site or what they</font>

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,869
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going to in the cloud and we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">fighting a losing battle like the only</font>

37
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,670
way to win is not to play but it's

38
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,680
certainly not that simple and the best

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,930
thing we can do once again is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to equip</font>

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,689
ourselves with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how all</font>

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,280
these products work so who here has

42
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,809
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone to a class on their</font>

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:00,149
companies or customers to what about a

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,570
storage based class with security like a

46
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,130
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused class</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two people in</font>

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,970
this group and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty</font>

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,068
high if you have and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,660
vendors they might have four or five

50
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,890
different product lines different types

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,299
of disk arrays

downhill your boss or your CTO won't be

the one blamed for mistakes or hacks or

data loss it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming down on you</font>

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,860
and sixty-nine percent of all companies

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had data loss in the last five</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years so even with the best design I</font>

mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have bugs hacks bad admins</font>

issues have led to death and I don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">our issues do come from the inside all</font>

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,160
with were because of employees mostly

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,440
executives or their staff now when you

77
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty one percent of all</font>

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,090
social engineering attacks like this are

79
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,000
financially motivated fourteen percent

80
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,940
of all attacks are revenge your own

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,769
people in my customer environments I'm

82
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically more scared of who's on staff</font>

83
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,850
because I know their experience and I

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,060
know their attitudes than I am of a

85
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,190
random hacker now we when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also think</font>

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it if just one percent of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font>

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,299
though I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> many disgrace they have</font>

90
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,489
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like snapshots so you can</font>

91
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">instantly jump back an entire file</font>

92
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,019
system or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single file to any point in</font>

93
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,450
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have a snap of it but</font>

94
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">many companies aren't running this or</font>

95
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,109
they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have licensed the feature</font>

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,570
or they might not have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage to</font>

97
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,140
actually hold enough staff shots for a

98
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,870
couple days or a couple weeks of local

99
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,570
retention but there's ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get around</font>

100
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,970
this I've seen very few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

101
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,149
run things like cryptolocker crypto wall

102
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,729
defense now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best defense in an</font>

103
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,270
attack is a good offense cutting it off

104
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,550
before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does damage</font>

105
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,289
I mean we have ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect the moment</font>

106
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,030
it writes out its first files and

107
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:32,949
shutting them down or writing out its

108
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,888
encryption key and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

109
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,330
couple examples this was like a response

110
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,860
to a reddit post that i did and

111
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,780
someone's asking about one certain disk

112
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,430
array<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't find anything for it</font>

113
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,369
that was easy so I wrote a small script

114
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,949
to do the same thing so back up

115
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,800
regularly snapshot often use tools like

116
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,530
these and please educate your users and

117
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,319
IT staff I mean education really is

118
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,710
everything this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is every major term from</font>

119
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the storage alliances dictionary now</font>

120
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,090
many we might know but many most

121
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,479
security people or most IT staff have no

122
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,400
idea what they are and when we think

123
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,650
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might know like a SAN</font>

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,680
local disk we have Nazz this is SMB or

128
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,629
NFS and this is when you have direct

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,690
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a file over a share or an</font>

130
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,569
export the San also has direct access to

131
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that file your San or your nails gets</font>

132
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:34,780
compromised someone can yank your files

133
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,099
or do whatever they want with them

134
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly now new players like object</font>

135
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,130
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking up steam I have a</font>

136
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:47,590
lot of customers with petabytes of files

137
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:50,050
billions and billions of files now how

138
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,419
do you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file that you need how</font>

139
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,690
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you manage it billions of files it's</font>

140
00:05:52,419 --> 00:06:00,340
a needle in a haystack now with object

141
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:02,610
this is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swift or Amazon s3 when you</font>

142
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,590
put a file up there into the repository

143
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,349
you can attach with it metadata as part

144
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,818

reference it or you can have your system

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:16,630
automatically generated but some of the

148
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,090
big concerns that security is definitely

149
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking into are the new players who</font>

154
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,430
of you so manufacturers vendors they

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,590
want to make everything simple Hyper

156
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,720
converged is when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,350
basically one scalable system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">how a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data centers are going now</font>

161
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,970
but the problem is you're tied to either

<font color="#E5E5E5">that vendor or issues they might have</font>

lot of players in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market there's</font>

169
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,789
dozens and dozens of storage companies

170
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,250
most of them they have different storage

171
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,990
platforms and products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and proprietary</font>

176
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,630
open-source products now I've met a lot

177
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,099
of the executives and engineers through

178
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,320
these through like tech field day or

179
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,850
storage field day and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that</font>

180
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,719
I've talked to they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a really</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that a lot of them are are in different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">spaces and one update might add a new</font>

186
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,979
protocol or it might update new ports we

187
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,750
have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more vigilant look at</font>

188
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,870
actually what's being installed on our

189
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,310
storage platforms and change our

190
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,900
methodologies on how we're going to

191
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,900
handle these updates or these additions

192
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,219
now what are some new trends and storage

193
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,870
that keep me up at night number one

194
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,870
direct connecting storage to a cloud

195
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,360
provider this is getting incredibly

196
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,210
popular I'll speak more on this in a bit

197
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,450
but I do have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides on it number</font>

198
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">two directly connecting containers or</font>

199
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,299
running containers like docker within

200
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,400
your sand<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearly every major storage</font>

201
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,339

202
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,409
be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so imagine that docker in</font>

203
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,090
a container and docker stores beta so

204
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,530
people can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> download containers at</font>

205
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,620
their will with a click of a button and

206
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,290
run them in your multi-million dollar

207
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,270
sand with all your corporate data so

208
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,339
some of these discs grades they have

209
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,170
bite of ram<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dozens of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course and</font>

210
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,990
companies feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when these</font>

211
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:03,459
are idle we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make use of them but</font>

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a huge security nightmare nvm where</font>

213
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,900
companies like<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware are trying to</font>

214
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,819
shake up the industry they put out visa

215
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,490
and they put out a lot of stuff they're

216
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting out new features constantly but</font>

217
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,750
they love embracing the past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

218
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,020
always in a good way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

219
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,510
companies use VMware I mean I love

220
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:27,699
VMware I've been using it since 1999 the

221
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:29,890
first beta of work station now they also

222
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,080
make storage they also make security a

223
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:37,630
giant pain in the ass<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll touch on</font>

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,000
this a bit so if you have a drink now

225
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,920
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the number one</font>

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:51,040
weakness in storage is shout out some

227
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:53,099
answers people people accessing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font>

229
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,000
they all run common operating systems

230
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,920
all of them even windows everything

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,959
common operating systems os-based

238
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,110
it was susceptible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a zero-day just</font>

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,689
like any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux box so the user</font>

240
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,629
account here was a read-only reporting

w get with a read-only reporting user

243

get exploits they had heartbleed<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">shock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and others I mean people want to</font>

automation they want to do PowerShell

00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,490
against it and this is an open door

251
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,259
because everything is there from the OS

252
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,990
is that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing in other fields</font>

253
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:01,000
there in our sand and these systems

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get updated quickly this one</font>

manufactured they updated and passed

256
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:10,029
within a month others took that long to

257
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:11,560
just deny that they had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem now I</font>

258
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,569
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

259
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,579

<font color="#CCCCCC">the time on customer data center</font>

locks passwords or security and what I

264
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,899
find is sis admins or storage admins

265
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,910
never change the install passwords they

266
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,970
don't know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break if they</font>

267
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,889
change anything and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rightly so</font>

268
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,889
they've probably been burnt before and

269
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,529
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making their jobs any easier</font>

270
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:43,439
so if they're not if they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

271
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,230
something like that or let's say shared

272
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:49,300
accounts admin root or whatever don't do

273
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,329
that make individual accounts for every

274
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,740
purpose but who here knew that most disk

275
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,089
arrays can actually integrate with

276
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,250
Active Directory even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

example of many issues with virtual

00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,490
appliances as a whole and storage

306
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,620
manufacturers are a huge problem with

307
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so just looking deeper into this</font>

312
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,630
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the console</font>

313
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,670
any VMware user whether it be through

X number of VMs in the customers

319
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,630
giving them an open door and this is

never put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into change control this is</font>

never given to security that you're

322
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,780
about to do this and companies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

virtual appliances everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

324
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,699
every single storage manufacturer has at

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,280
least one be it monitoring or phoning

326
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,310
homing system management VMware as their

bazar providers which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> V storage API</font>

328
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:30,390
r v storage API is for storage awareness

329
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:34,210
back up VMs so who audits these I mean I

330
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:36,699
don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming with docker soon</font>

331
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,310
in all sand and the doctor stalker store

332
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,230
it's going to get even worse so I gave a

333
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,959
talk like this at a university at a

334
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,240
conference and I just grabbed a random

335

linkedin profile by a random admin<font color="#E5E5E5"> @</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there at their University I know</font>

337
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,150
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they run now I know versions</font>

338
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,830
that they run I know their storage and I

339
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,569
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how I can get into their</font>

340
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,130
environment and trickle out every bit of

341
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:06,370
data they have so be care of what you're

342
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,320
telling the public now I'd be remiss if

343
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,060
I didn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud so the</font>

344
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,650
cloud is sort of like having<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lando as a</font>

345
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,199
best friend it's a blessing and a curse

346
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,730
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about one instance</font>

347
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,620
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people might not think is</font>

348
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,800
storage security but at its heart it

349
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,529
really is code spaces who's heard of

350
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,280
code spaces they were an online

351
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:29,110
repository a lot like github and one

352
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,000
night they were d dost it lasted about

353
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,640
12 hours long enough for the the hacker

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,070
exploit to get in and delete every

355
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,220
single snapshot they had every back up

356
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,320
in s amazon s3 every block store every

357
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,270
single VM so when 12 hours this

358
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,339
multi-million dollar company was put out

359
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:51,550
of business overnight and that is

360
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:54,100
entirely a storage issue why everything

361
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">was under one roof one API key one</font>

362
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,050
console they had no immutable backups or

363
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,540
no backups outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cloud provider</font>

364
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,359
that they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using if they did this</font>

365
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,209
business would still be around now I

366
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,410
mentioned cloud-connected storage so you

367
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:13,719
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 1 to 10 gig link to AWS or for</font>

368
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,850
pretty cheap and Layton sees are really

369
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,640
good so a lot of customers they're

370
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,980
putting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> San either virtual in the</font>

371
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,980
cloud or at a shared provider and cross

372
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,020
connecting up and there may be bursting

373
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,150
to the cloud providers for compute or

374
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,819
they're doing replication between their

375
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,770
sites this way it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

376
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,670
awesome imagine something like an Oracle

377
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,400
RAC or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sequel cluster between ash</font>

378
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,079
AWS<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iraq space you have cloud fault</font>

379
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">tolerance because you have centralized</font>

380
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,720
storage between multiple cloud providers

381
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:46,700
so this can be incredibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful if it's</font>

382
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,650
protected right if it's not protected

383
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,290
right it's an open door into a storage

384
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:55,819
network in your headquarters or the Colo

385
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:58,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tapes they're not going anywhere I</font>

386
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers that some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them have</font>

387
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,750
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 100 year retention time</font>

388
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,000
especially in biotech or medical where

389
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,460
you have to keep records for life of

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,950
your patient and then some financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

391
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,560
similar things with mortgages<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

392
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:15,050
actually is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to protect them</font>

393
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,419
it's easy to encrypt most have it on

394
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,319
board if you just enable it but why do

395
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,630
we hear so many issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then why</font>

396
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,079
aren't we hearing much about San layer

397
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:30,680
being stolen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

398
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:36,020
how to monitor it we don't audit it as

399
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,720
so much data that we're not CSI so

400
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,790
storage auditing is really a forgotten

401
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,160
about practice if you go in and review

402
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:47,180
command history or review every open

403
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,980
file and nine times out of ten

404
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,900
monitoring tools are the first thing to

405
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,550
get cut out of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget if middle</font>

406
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,870
management doesn't see a profit gain

407
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,600
from a purchase they're not going to

408

<font color="#E5E5E5">fight it at the upper executives to</font>

their team have a better life or do

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,420
their job better<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on the topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

412
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,840
encryption I don't know if you know the

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,270
story but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rebels stole satellite and</font>

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">they listened in and the Death Star</font>

415
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,570

416
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,909
wouldn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd make that mistake</font>

417
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,409
but what I see is sort of like a state

418
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,990
of the storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry encryption</font>

419
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,340
adoption I have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

420
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've talked to that they don't know what</font>

421
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,800
encryption is so when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

422
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">how many mom and pops do you know that</font>

423
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,129
might have grown organically or other

small business they don't know about

425

426
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,360
hammers what do we know about protecting

credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and that's home depot</font>

428
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,990
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more prevalent than you might</font>

429
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,530
think or customers that are like well

430
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,740
encryption

431
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,960
is too expensive and if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

432
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">a compliance reason to buy encrypted</font>

434
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,700
price is the ultimate motivator now

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies that might have to encrypt</font>

436
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,100
because of regulatory compliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> ha's</font>

437
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,490
will do the bare minimum I have one that

438
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,429
they encrypted one column in one table

439
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,110
in one database instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying maybe</font>

440
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,790
thirty percent more and buying an entire

441
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:23,149
encrypted disk array that's happening so

442
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,159
price is a big motivator now luckily

443
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,910
many all-flash arrays and newer storage

444
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:32,150
arrays are encrypting out of the box is

445
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:36,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that either with like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aes 256 or self</font>

446
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:39,110
encrypting<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks now life of storage is</font>

447
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,120
really long so this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a few years</font>

448
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,139
out before people even go ahead and do

449
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,770
this in their refresh and absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

450
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,020
one encrypts in flight and at rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

451
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,460
to end through all their tears believe

452
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,930
me I've tried to sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they won't buy</font>

453
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it now who here is storage from maybe at</font>

454
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,480
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the platforms up there</font>

455
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,550
quite a few now you'll see even within

456
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,610
the same companies how they're doing

457
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">encryption is much different between all</font>

458
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,310
their different platforms and this adds

459
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,810
complexity which reduces security and we

460
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,490
have to be very careful about encryption

461
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,870
on the cheap because if you remember

462
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:22,580
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> truecrypt who's auditing it</font>

463
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,550
so please in your next refresh cycles

464
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,439
think about encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your storage</font>

465
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,530
now delving deeper into the protocols we

466
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,080
have like NFS version 3 this was put out

467
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,510
in 1995 that was the year kevin Mitnick

468
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,669
was arrested microsoft bob was released

469
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,160
and hackers was in the movie theaters

470
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,220
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running a protocol older than many</font>

471
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people running this conference</font>

472
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,430
NFS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 is not for security and even</font>

473
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">vmware says it that well just segmented</font>

474
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,610
off because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

475
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:58,340
for you so we have a new protocol 4.1

476
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,770
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally added Kerberos support but</font>

477
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,100
that was released<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 1993 that cipher</font>

478
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,900
windows 7

479
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,280
won't even use that cipher was blocked

480
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:12,929
and it's not supported with most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

481
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,720
their other products or SMB<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sifts we</font>

482
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:17,730
are absolutely screwed no matter what so

483
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,850
most people think that attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> our front</font>

484
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,039
side from the end user but protection

485
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,530
has to come from the back end if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

486
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,110
doing things like smb2 or message

signing most<font color="#CCCCCC"> sanwa actually downgrade</font>

downgrade that from two to one if they

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,719
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol issue so it really is</font>

495

might<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate it but Windows 10 or 2012 r2</font>

496
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,520
supports smb3 which is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

497
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,020
good it can be encrypted it can be much

498
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">more safer than anything we've had</font>

499
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,770
before now as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the San itself it's</font>

500
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,629
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncommon to see brocade or cisco MDS</font>

501
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,020
is with five to six year old firmware

502
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,880
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very common or systems not</font>

503
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,700
being updated except for maybe once a

504
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,010
year or after<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years when they</font>

505
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,750
refresh out to new hardware now

506
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,270
customers feel if it's not broke for the

507
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,429
love of<font color="#E5E5E5"> God don't fix it we have to live</font>

508
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,129
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> die by the vendors compatibility</font>

509
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,159
matrix and this leads to stale versions

510
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,679
and exploitable systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

511
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,720
very bare minimum thing like zoning

512
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,630
people half-ass it because they don't

513
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,760
understand it so single<font color="#CCCCCC"> initiator single</font>

514
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,650
target zoning with w WN s that means

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,840
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one adapter can talk to this</font>

516
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,900
one on the sand and people usually don't

517
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,559
do that or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do run the management</font>

518
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:46,020
firmware with the drivers this opens up

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">RPC web ports and many other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,950
if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nauman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a network that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever firmware i want to their hbas</font>

523
00:22:51,929 --> 00:23:00,000
or take out the ports now I scuzzy Oh

524
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:05,220
people say well you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use I scuzzy off</font>

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,110
like chap very few but I can box reveal

526
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,880
it on any system you have chap enabled

527
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:13,610
on so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually very secure and</font>

528
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,340
I've seen this done in an environment

529
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:21,309
non IT staff and the password used was

530
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:23,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows domain admin password so and</font>

531
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:25,450
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the finish up a little bit we</font>

532
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,980
see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of vendors removing some</font>

533
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,100
security information from their

534
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:34,270
documentation about what is the best way

535
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,540
to harden a system so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

536
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:40,220
we have to implore to the vendors that

537
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,710
they must<font color="#E5E5E5"> make security of focus and not</font>

538
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,260
an insane cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition and then also</font>

539
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,000
back up back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up back up if you don't</font>

540
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,120
have three different types I mean online

541
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">like snapshots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nearline like replication</font>

542
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,590
and offline meaning an immutable backup

543
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,629
tape or whatever I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

544
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,939
hate tape but it's the easy way to

545
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,809
describe what an immutable backup is you

546
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,570
must be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

547
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,549
coming it's great to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here not a lot</font>

548
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time for questions but if you see me</font>

549
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,600
anywhere at the conference hit me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

550
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,340
with whatever questions you have or hit

551
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up on Twitter because I can talk for</font>

552
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,540
days about this so this

553
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,080
before we go to questions I just want to

554
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,150
remind everyone that this track is being

555
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,330
recorded<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you can use the mic at</font>

556
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:38,000
the front or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can run a mic to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so</font>

557
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:40,310
let's start questions anyone all right

558
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's get give the speaker another round</font>

559
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,760
of applause
