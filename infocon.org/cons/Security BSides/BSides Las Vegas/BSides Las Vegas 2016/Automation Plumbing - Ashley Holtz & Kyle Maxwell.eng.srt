okay who here does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not appreciate modern</font>

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,849
plumbing a walk aid does not appreciate

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well then I never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go near</font>

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,739
okay good i work in some related stuff

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,360
i'll bill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help this resident no no it</font>

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,309
ended up being I was like I got to write

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,699
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and do this stuff so without</font>

19
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,280
anything further<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ashley Holtz plugs back</font>

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:07,590
automation plumbing because everybody

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:11,040
needs to flush their data do a speech so

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,990
I do automation stuff primarily my job

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,310
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give us to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about my</font>

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,539
job which will be fun for all of you so

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,479
I'm talking about plumbing i'm not

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,680
talking about I our tools and you know

27
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,600
which ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good which ones are bad</font>

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,189
there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who know a lot</font>

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than I do about specific artifacts</font>

30
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,329
so I don't want to write my own thing

31
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,090
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time sometimes I do out of</font>

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,710
necessity but usually it's ashley

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,570
connect the things so I'm doing a

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,939
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things talk in some ways</font>

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can do that a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

36
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,579
there are a lot of great tools available

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
already they don't connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> well out of</font>

38
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the box and I eventually want to see</font>

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,340
people waste less<font color="#CCCCCC"> time running stuff</font>

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,399
over and over again so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my ideal</font>

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,189
workflow for a sock so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

42
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,799
in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your in your own company</font>

43
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,449
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of like me being a</font>

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,689
consultant going out to 50 different

45
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,280
companies inside of your own company

46
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideally you find out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,590
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on on some employee and</font>

48
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,660
you figure that out through some user

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,790
report through

50
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,079
sim one of your five hundred things that

51
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,570
you already purchased in your

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,780
environment who owns five hundred things

53
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,400
I certainly do yeah so you put it in a

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,230
queue we have some metadata that's

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,090
common to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things if there's</font>

56
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,890
something going wrong you probably know

57
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,570
the IP address of where it's going wrong

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,769
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host name I would hope because</font>

59
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,560
otherwise how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you going to remediate</font>

60
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,630
it you you should know some information

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,760
around the event user what type of alert

62
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,890
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it should go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cue from</font>

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue you should be able to say okay</font>

64
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,529
you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> level one guys usually and</font>

65
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,109
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say this is BS this</font>

66
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,490
isn't BS so if it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a false positive</font>

67
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to adjust your</font>

68
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,820
detection rules and I have adjusting

69
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,890
detection rules in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

70
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,480
places because once we learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> more we</font>

71
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,980
always want backward propagation and

72
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,170
that doesn't always happen in a lot of

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">security settings it's we're going to</font>

74
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,609
wait for somebody to give us new

75
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,660
signatures or something and does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

76
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,670
work well for anyone ever not really so

77
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,000
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find new things we want to learn</font>

78
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">more about the things so once we've</font>

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,650
gotten to the point where this isn't BS

80
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,730
we want to investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> this further</font>

81
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,860
ideally I would have an analyst who can

82
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the button and say run these</font>

83
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,459
commands that I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> run so if</font>

84
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,679
somebody clicked on a link from a

85
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,760
phishing email<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,440
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what outgoing connections are</font>

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,260
happening let's see what's running on

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,130
the box right now so like what netstat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,410
would want to be able to do that

90
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,510
remotely so that's what i mean by triage

91
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,040
metadata command output so commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

92
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,420
the commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if i were sitting on</font>

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person's box what are the things</font>

94
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,619
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would type on that box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,170
metadata would be things that we can

96
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,000
easily query from a built-in<font color="#CCCCCC"> api so</font>

97
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,109
linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very friendly to us it can</font>

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,940
usually get most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things from the</font>

99
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,270
command line windows doesn't work that

100
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,820
way sometimes we have to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up c sharp</font>

101
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,370
and hook some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows api</font>

102
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,690
whatever sometimes from there you need

103
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pivot and collect a little bit more</font>

104
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,090
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect a range of events</font>

105
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,410
from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft instead of just I want to</font>

106
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,730
know that this thing is on the box<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

107
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,989
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what else hit the box at</font>

108
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,519
the same time I want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> journal I</font>

109
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,739
want to see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of other things so</font>

110
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's artifacts forensic artifacts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

111
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,850
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I are in here sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

112
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,709
want targeted<font color="#CCCCCC"> network capture I put</font>

113
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,150
those on the same level because it's

114
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,829
either pivoting into getting more

115
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,590
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Network homes in</font>

116
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,550
general like okay we know this bad IP

117
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,198
address is being

118
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,120
called out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this box let's see if</font>

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is calling out there so</font>

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more information that way</font>

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,819
or it's I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting specific files from</font>

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,590
the specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> host based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off of some bad</font>

123
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,060
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

124
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,739
you might want even more targeted files

125
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,509
like let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me get the actual piece of</font>

126
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware which there aren't a lot of</font>

127
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,770
endpoint agents that let you just

128
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:48,550
willy-nilly pull a file that you feel

129
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,500
like pulling but they shouldn't do that

130
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,590
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not very safe and you can</font>

131
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,139
debate that with me over a beer later so

132
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,729
once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all that information the</font>

133
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,919
last piece and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important piece</font>

134
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,628
at least for me is standardizing and

135
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,909
aggregating being able to put them into

136
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,379
a central<font color="#E5E5E5"> location because I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

137
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,180
to just say here's the outputs from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

138
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,740
commands you need to learn how to look

139
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,240
at these 50 different things no it

140
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,580
should all be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one place it should be</font>

141
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to query it should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

142
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,250
simple that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit a button and you</font>

143
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,258
find evil laugh<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my joke there's no</font>

144
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,780
fine you there's no find evil button

145
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,340
come on nothing can replace a good

146
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,229
analyst and that's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,299
call this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plumbing piece of the</font>

148
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,580
automation this is not analysis

149
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,669
automation because otherwise I wouldn't

150
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,639
have a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we could automate the</font>

151
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:41,210
island analysis away sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

152
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,130
want to parse something so linux web

153
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,989
servers they give me nice logs there is

154
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,759
a nice way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to parse those many</font>

155
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,650
established open source and commercial

156
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,630
products can do that whatever sometimes

157
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,549
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to process them so something</font>

158
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,979
that's stored as like binary clusters

159
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,599
something that's stored as some like

160
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:58,279
decently well documented artifact like

161
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,409
know a lot about prefetch files but if

162
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:02,930
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> open one up it's like heck is</font>

163
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:04,879
this and then if we wanted specific

164
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:10,069
files do we want to store malware

165
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:14,300
executables just in a file server<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the</font>

166
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:15,979
malware analyst says yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually want</font>

167
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,919
to obfuscate those and code them somehow

168
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,330
just store them as blob who knows but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

169
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,909
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to store that stuff</font>

170
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,800
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured out there's something</font>

171
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,509
going on on this box it's weird I get

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,039
more information the types of

173
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:30,770
information I get should be aggregated

174
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,180
in some sane way and if you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

175
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,310
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own tools and analyst you can</font>

176
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,259
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can hook into this I</font>

177
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,120
understand the output I can do more with

178
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,520
it i can write rules to look for evil

179
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,169
things that I know about

180
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,960
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just download the results from</font>

181
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,389
specific tools and there are a lot of

182
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,099
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do this or you can make your</font>

183
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,650
own tools I'm giving you a maker by

184
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:55,479
decision here for the one business major

185
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,099
in the room yeah so by doesn't mean

186
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,669
you're shelling out cash for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this by</font>

187
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,020
means somebody else made this thing and

188
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,150
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using it so a</font>

189
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,609
well-documented open source project

190
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,859
that's been community vetted why don't I

191
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:13,330
say oh just find some code on the

192
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet that's no no I'm saying well</font>

193
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,270
documented open source project that's

194
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,650
why I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it something that you can buy</font>

195
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,349
something that's already been vetted

196
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,539
something that's relatively well used so

197
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,979
the other piece of this as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font>

198
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,050
these so if you have an in-house

199
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,900
programmer like me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

200
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,909
go code the things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

201
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,989
have that and not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us have</font>

202
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,930
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all of that</font>

203
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,690
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

204
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but the last piece that artifact</font>

205
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,560
analysis automation and some of the

206
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,539
processing around that there isn't

207
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,069
something that will run everybody else's

208
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,080
tools and there's not one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

209
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,400
processes all the things and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

210
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,870
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> want one thing that</font>

211
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,219
processes all the things one tool to

212
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,889
rule them all is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right way to do</font>

213
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,120
this because one greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going to</font>

214
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to process all the things the</font>

215
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,949
best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily so for processing</font>

216
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,469
automation this is after we've gotten

217
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:05,349
artifacts out after we've gotten all the

218
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:06,880
metadata whatever the most automatic

219
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">on-demand fast way would be</font>

220
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">containerized cluster eyes processing we</font>

221
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,318
have lots of machines working in

222
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,849
parallel super<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple maybe they're all</font>

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,279
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same process and you've got</font>

224
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:21,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">this queue that feeds them that would be</font>

225
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,680
so nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and so usable but we</font>

226
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,270
don't usually have that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,819
companies are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> way down here</font>

228
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,159
they've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local vm you're on your</font>

229
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,200
macbook here you spin up your sand sift

230
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,049
and you run all the tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you spent</font>

231
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,969
a week learning how to use manually well

232
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,620
that's great and if you want to build

233
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,870
lots of hours that's a really good way

234
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,339
to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to provide a</font>

235
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,990
product that's useful wouldn't it be

236
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,630
great if you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the results</font>

237
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,550
out nearly instantaneously and then have

238
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,459
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and spend those six hours</font>

239
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,359
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis instead of running tools</font>

240
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:55,260
I think

241
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,690
that's a good way to do it some of the

242
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,850
for-profit distributions i'll call them

243
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,890
for profit<font color="#E5E5E5"> x ways on case they have</font>

244
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,290
processing for some artifacts built in

245
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,420
and you can extend those as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

246
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,130
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that necessarily heavy</font>

247
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,719
automation and I don't put it very high

248
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,370
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scale because again it's one</font>

249
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,190
creator and you still have to plug

250
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,839
things into it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

251
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,839
a couple of plumbing solutions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

252
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,790
use and I'm very open to healthy debate

253
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,019
but I do have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of material to get</font>

254
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,990
through so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask you to save</font>

255
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,630
questions comments concerns till the end

256
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,760
so CrowdStrike has a crowd response a

257
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,560
freeware tool not trying to sell you

258
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care if you</font>

259
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,649
use it or not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like it okay you we</font>

260
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,350
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Python scripts that we use</font>

261
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:44,110
internally we have api's that we use to

262
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,180
insert stuff into databases so i'm going

263
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you what step of this workflow</font>

264
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,810
each of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> would live on and</font>

265
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,459
i'm also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release these flies</font>

266
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,529
along with that github repo that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I on</font>

267
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,768
the first slide so you can mess around

268
00:09:53,529 --> 00:10:01,209
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as well some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is super</font>

269
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:04,180
hockey it's super<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacky so many</font>

270
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:09,550
collectors including crowd response have

271
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:12,130
a place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration you can embed</font>

272
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,300
a configuration in crowd response well

273
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,370
the way to automate that is to use

274
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,469
resource hacker and replace the resource

275
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,610
where that config is with your

276
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:24,760
configuration I got a cringe yeah super

277
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,829
hacky so<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we deploy crowd response</font>

278
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,620
it does run a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

279
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">get through the windows api and it</font>

280
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,220
outputs things that you would get from

281
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,360
running commands on that machine it's

282
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,620

283
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,230
distribution and it's a fairly small

284
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">binary which is why i like it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

285
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,470
can write a text configuration embed it

286
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,180
there so this would be this metadata

287
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,279
triage kind of the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

would deploy it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a get all the</font>

things it's not a get a full triage

291
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,720
giant and move over the network we don't

292
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,839
want to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that quite yet so this</font>

293
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little easy tip you have to be</font>

294
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">very careful to read the EULA of the</font>

295
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,339
binary that you're modifying do not just

296
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,589
open up crap in resource hacker replace

297
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,770
things and deploy it in your environment

298
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:13,840
reveal none of your going to read the

299
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:16,480
ola the next piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is image</font>

300
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,180
processing so if you have a hard disk

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,860
image which we occasionally get or if

302
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,089
you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's going to</font>

303
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,710
run on the machine and actually get out

304
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,780
forensic artifacts as opposed to stuff

305
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would run a command to get the</font>

306
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote a quick dirty</font>

307
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,610
extractor to demo how to do this there

308
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,680
are a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can extract</font>

309
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,540
artifacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

310
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,310
best way to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something to</font>

311
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,079
demonstrate a point and my point so you

312
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,400
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the metadata you can't get</font>

313
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,740
artifacts and you can get individual

314
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,829
files my point is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want same</font>

315
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,980
parsable JSON output from every piece of

316
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stack so how many of you have</font>

317
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,190
encountered a really great forensics

318
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,660
tool that does not<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you same</font>

319
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,230
parsable output and you have to write

320
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,579
something else to process the thing

321
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:05,320
thank you for writing the tool like

322
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,730
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid of you and giving</font>

323
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,110
back to the community is really great

324
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,060
but let me use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so XML is fine too but</font>

325
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,310
i really like JSON a lot of our

326
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,050
automation is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python JSON converts</font>

327
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,630
pretty easily into a Python dictionaries

328
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,640
that's why i choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> json but really same</font>

329
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,250
parsable output that everything can

330
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,500
process from start to finish is so nice

331
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,110
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life so easy and a lot of</font>

332
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,180
the automation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up coding is how do</font>

333
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,490
I make this thing able to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> inserted</font>

334
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,290
into another thing and I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

335
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,690
time doing that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want you to</font>

336
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to spend time doing that so the</font>

337
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,040
little collector that I wrote basically

338
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,040
puts all the files files in a single

339
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,130
folder and then has this JSON manifest

340
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,250
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably quite small print but</font>

341
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,230
you can see this rule field so EBT<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

342
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,390
this is a new style event log right so

343
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,070
the rule that<font color="#E5E5E5"> triggered this is the kind</font>

344
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,480
of thing it is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to read the</font>

345
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,300
first couple lines of the file to see

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,590
what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is nice we have a hash</font>

347
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,240
of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C times so Mac</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

348
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,140
sizes which data stream it was because

349
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,910
sometimes you have alternate data

350
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,650
streams and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run a red</font>

351
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,800
parser to go against this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

352
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,750
parse the right data stream so it's it

353
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,329
makes my life a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that</font>

354
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,100
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have same</font>

355
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,769
possible output please code same

356
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">parsable output into your stuff and save</font>

357
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:29,290
somebody like me a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time the other</font>

358
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of this is processing automation</font>

359
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,998
in terms of using other people's stuff

360
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:36,519
to insert your things into some big data

361
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:38,230
solution I like the ELQ stock pretty

362
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,929
good a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the elk stack</font>

363
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,699
log stash is fairly friendly for most

364
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,879
types if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a good log stash</font>

365
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:48,758
configuration for it but the main thing

366
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,739
here is if other people's stuff can't

367
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,639
pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up easily you're doing something</font>

368
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:56,379
wrong with your output so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part</font>

369
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,759
of the standardizing and aggregating and

370
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:04,929
the processing and parsing piece of this

371
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:09,429
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually our executables are our tools</font>

372
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:11,170
for parsing pieces of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> images or</font>

373
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:13,509
parsing specific artifacts they come in

374
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,399
two flavors there's here's an executable

375
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,660
it's freeware like crowd response we're

376
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,509
not giving you the source code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

377
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,980
but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> run it or there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

378
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:26,379
library so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make everybody</font>

379
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,049
else's python library runnable in a

380
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,869
standardized way well here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer</font>

381
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:34,480
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least the one that I came up with</font>

382
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:35,919
just a basic interface type of object so

383
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
Python doesn't necessarily have a

384
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,029
straight-up interface class I just

385
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,389
create a runner class and you can

386
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,399
inherit that runner class so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

387
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple in it you take in an input</font>

388
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,249
and an output and then run the actual

389
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:54,429
Python library so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more of an</font>

390
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:57,999
automation piece and it's running other

391
00:14:54,429 --> 00:15:01,720
people's code the reason behind this is

392
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:04,089
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have 50 different rules</font>

393
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,559
like event logs there's about 20

394
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,600
different tools that exist that parse

395
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,899
those do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's all somebody</font>

396
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,999
else's tool dot run to process it no

397
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,499
they're all completely different but if

398
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:16,029
you can standardize it this way or

399
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:18,730
modify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source code and then</font>

400
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,529
contribute it back upstream to fit into

401
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,149
this paradigm it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a</font>

402
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:25,329
lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people to run it</font>

403
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,649
and integrate it so just simple simple

404
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,000
class so I have a run method and I have

405
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,950
a quick method

406
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,980
elasticsearch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk plumbing how</font>

407
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,820
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use elastic search and how</font>

408
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:44,940
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk and how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want to talk about this so I</font>

410
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,650
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of treats just for these</font>

411
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,290
sides and everybody else who's going to

412
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,819
watch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video i suppose i did create a</font>

413
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,920
log stash configuration for crowd

414
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,660
response so for the output after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

415
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you run the conversion tool it</font>

416
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,870
takes in the csbs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also released a</font>

417
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,550
configuration for crowd response so

418
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember that resource hacker bit where</font>

419
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can embed a configuration in there</font>

420
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,459
here's the configuration that you embed

421
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,770
of course we're going to test this first

422
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we implement this in a production</font>

to convert your data and insert it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

430
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,090
made this mistake fairly early when i

431
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,210
started doing automation engineering

432
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,650
don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use an API that just sends</font>

433
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,570
events through a socket that's going to

434
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,150
be much slower than using tools that are

435
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,550
created for listening and throwing

436
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,900
events in so like log stash for instance

437
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,630
you can have multiple workers going<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

440
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,870
closing sockets so don't try to reinvent

00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,210
the wheel if there's a thing that can

444
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,859
sounds completely logical<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent a long</font>

445
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:12,270
time Bree making logstash essentially

446
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:15,629
also with log stash if you specify

447
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,339
column names and mutations for data / /

448
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,470

454
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:39,510
mentor Kyle asked for a graph here's a

graph man bar chart so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Splunk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sdk for python</font>

457
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:48,790
and it is streaming sockets it works

458
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,710
pretty well it's well documented I found

459
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,960
out a much faster way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

460
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,430
results from<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk so one of the</font>

461
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,230
automation steps that I get asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

462
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,820
a lot is download stuff from<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font>

463
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,350
based off of this query and then do

464
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,879
other processing on top of it that's

465
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be slower or inefficient in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">splunk so my preference is to do this</font>

467
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,260
direct download approach the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font>

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,840
my github<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk through</font>

walk through code right so it's when I

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,440
tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much faster if you want</font>

to test<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and give me your test results</font>

474

I would appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing those I also</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually run this benchmark yourself</font>

477
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,889
and say Ashley you're full of crap or

478
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:33,520
yeah that's true so please have fun with

480

our people to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools really</font>

486
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,320
well and interpret the output of these

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,540
50 different things and that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing it for a couple of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years hitting go on 50 different tools</font>

492
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,000
is very irritating<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with the</font>

creating output that's usable in other

497

places so like that JSON output will

498

really make your life a lot easier in

499
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,290
terms of automating the analysis steps

500
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,870
that I think do lend themselves to

501
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,700
automation like statistics and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">other thing too is if you're putting</font>

everything in a standardized place and

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,540
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing hunting today that back</font>

today i also have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data from</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old data existed elsewhere maybe we</font>

511
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,510
have more to remediate than we thought

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,950
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see oh well that's</font>

standardizing

516
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,730
in general will speed up processing but

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,830
really for me as the programmer in a

room<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consultants most of the time at</font>

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,389
these guys love to create scripts and I

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,100
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> when people create scripts I</font>

522
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,539
like it when people contribute things to

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source communities that's very</font>

524
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,610
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me but make it so that</font>

somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else can reuse it or plug it</font>

connect all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the processing steps and</font>

528
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,690
there are a lot of community vetted

of them most effectively along with

those little one off tools that are

536
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:50,949
really good individually you have to

537
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:54,270
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few plumbing steps so hopefully</font>

538
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,529
that answers what automation plumbing is

539
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,179
hopefully now you have a better

again<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good joke and and</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment about where</font>

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,219
that progress is going or what your idea

566
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,250
that is I mean I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with it</font>

567
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,640
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about it</font>

568
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,710
but especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> ooh let's go all the way</font>

569
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,060
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the slides so you see where</font>

570
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things it's alert</font>

571
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,899
aggregation I would really like to

572
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,180
somebody to write just a nice open

573
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,090
source out of the box ready to use

574
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,530
aggregator and cure or a signer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

575
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,110
would be really nice to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I were to</font>

576
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,060
pick where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go and then these</font>

577
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,070
little glue pieces between different

578
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,820
forensic tools would be really cool to

579
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,820
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

580
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:55,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">not necessarily go to source yeah and I</font>

581
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean I probably wouldn't be my favorite</font>

582
00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:00,559
approach for it I I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give things</font>

583
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">away open source style I like people to</font>

584
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,260
criticize what I put out and I do think

585
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,570
forensics in general it kind of does

586
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,360
lend itself to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source examination</font>

587
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,399
because just because I've observed

588
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,959
something 20 times maybe you've observed

589
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:16,428
it one more time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks different</font>

590
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">and acts differently from how I've</font>

591
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:23,330
interpreted it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I don't</font>

592
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:26,840
like saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be one closed</font>

593
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:30,769
source opinion but but yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> super</font>

594
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,080
cool in your workflow steps I don't

595
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:37,029
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the more data step of the</font>

596
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:40,490
the feedback loop has to mean that that

597
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:42,110
folks like us lose our jobs but um I'm

598
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">just interested to know have you</font>

599
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:47,360
experimented with automating this

600
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,399
feedback loop to improve the tool based

601
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,750
on the simplest based on whatever data

602
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:53,559
you're getting back about yeah this is

603
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,139
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> this way yeah so we actually have</font>

604
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually just feedback from an</font>

605
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:01,699
analyst and they'll say yeah this makes

606
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,399
sense this actually was bad and then

607
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,590
that will get fed back into like a hash

608
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:09,229
table or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I were</font>

609
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,059
to have like my own socks and I'm in

610
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,620
consulting so I can't really go and just

611
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,480
collect random things from a bunch of

612
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,149
client environments for fun but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I had</font>

613
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
my own sock where I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just writing all</font>

614
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,590
of this individually I'd love to build

615
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,210
automation around<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay once on this</font>

616
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,360
workflow step the analyst has checked

617
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,860
that this is bad and this particular

618
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,889
line of output is where we found the bad

619
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,959
thing because it's standardized perhaps

620
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:34,309
we could take a path pattern or all of

621
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,960
the information that's associated with

622
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:43,220
that and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into the bad area but</font>

623
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,049
yeah I in mass have not been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

624
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,860
experiment with that just informally

625
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,860
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

626
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:58,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">does have any questions anybody 32 now</font>

627
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well thank you ashley thank you</font>

628
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,270
guys
