00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,489
very good morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to thank</font>

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,269
the b-sides organization for having us

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,340
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did this presentation early</font>

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,689
this year besides New York we have

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">updated it with a new information new</font>

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,039
data and hopefully we have a bonus for

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,720
you it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a preview of an</font>

were previously on on on the keynote you

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,410
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear a lot of truth of about</font>

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,230
the myths of machine learning we're not

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,620
here to preach you on machine learning

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,569
as a panacea but we definitely believe

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,989
it is an enhancer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say a</font>

interested in this in this area and

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,060
either have a data analytics for data

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually good when one ball for the mix</font>

don't understand what when malware is

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:23,340
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example this year that's numbers oh</font>

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,569
you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hardcore security</font>

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,670
researchers but don't understand the

49
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,920
conservative statistics so we've been

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,190
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that synergy because we</font>

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,530
both have survey a gradient where we

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:40,220
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> at one point and we're part of our</font>

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,220
interested in the hacking community so

54
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,019
in order for us to talk to you about

55
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,109
machine learning obviously we had to

56
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:54,000
talk about the data big data as we all

57
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:57,420
know is it's something that is described

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,579
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bunch of arable very large and</font>

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:04,980
fluid among the data that cannot be

60

the event amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big data who had</font>

62
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,900
things like Hadoop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dupe is actually</font>

63
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:16,950
my opinion a a revolutionary technology

64
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,480
is still advancing but it gave us a way

65
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:24,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use commodity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware to distribute</font>

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,880
processing and analysis of all this big

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,780
chunk of data that otherwise would not

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:35,910
be possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze and make</font>

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,959
conclusions or assertions on it so we're

70
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,549
going to talk about the machine learning

71
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,970
applied to security workflows and how it

72
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,500
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> helps and its limitations and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a central nervous</font>

system approach to<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavioral security</font>

75
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,250
we're going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lambda</font>

76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:04:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense architecture so as I said before</font>

77
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,410
big data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is obviously defined as a very</font>

78
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:08,519
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very fluid</font>

79
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it changes constantly and it's very</font>

80
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">large in size so it's usually very</font>

81
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,180
difficult to process to process on its

82
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:20,570
own and it requires lots of processing

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:25,110
power in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tackle so right now</font>

84
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:27,169
the way we see this and and serve a

85
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,819
putting this together with current

86
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:33,210
technologies and defense technologies we

87
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:36,090
have enterprises where there's a

88
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,128
plethora of devices with lots of logs

89
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:43,560
and alerts that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> constantly producing</font>

90
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:45,990
data and this data is distributed in too

91
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,689
many places and the analysis is usually

92
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,780
slows and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these companies are</font>

93
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:54,419
using same products which they

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,948
definitely allow us to put a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

95
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:00,659
together but in certain cases or in

96
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,300
cases where decisions have to be made

97
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:08,509
pretty quick they fall short because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">their limitations in processing power so</font>

99
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:14,279
like I said before same definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

100
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,949
life easier but a server gets to a

101
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,620
certain point where it's almost a

102
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,020
stagnant and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more technology such</font>

103
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,639
as Hadoop provide an advantage to

104
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes data and to apply machine</font>

105
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,060
learning technologies such as the

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,469
algorithms and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

107
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're going to talk about you know</font>

108
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:36,180
how you train algorithms how you know

109
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,740
when the algorithm is ready you know

110
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,270
machines are like babies right so I hear

111
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,029
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when somebody said yeah I can</font>

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">beat a machine yeah you can also be my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

113
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:50,490
year old daughter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> chess all right</font>

114
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,289
why because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trained once that</font>

115
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:56,189
machine strain it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has the knowledge and</font>

116
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,210
the experience that you have we it's

117
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,349
gonna give you a good run for your money

118
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so sometimes seeing machines I know</font>

119
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:09,719
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we feel somehow nervous or</font>

120
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,639
anxious about the the machines basically

121
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,370
coming over to work place<font color="#CCCCCC"> and probably</font>

122
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,770
taking over a lot of our work functions

123
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,080
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we believe is</font>

124
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,508
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one positions at</font>

125
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,039
one point will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taking by machine</font>

126
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,990
learning technology and you will see

127
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as we move and we show you the</font>

128
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:31,650
architecture however we shouldn't be

129
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that anxious this this is a technology</font>

130
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,039
that is still in its infancy this is a

131
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,409
technology can be understood can be

132
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:43,748
managed and so far

133
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:45,639
can be controlled so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's four</font>

134
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:47,800
examples years have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one example of</font>

135
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,509
the utility of this technology's right

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,089
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs an organization an average of</font>

137
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:58,739
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point 27 million annually in time</font>

138
00:06:55,089 --> 00:07:01,209
wasted the responding to erroneous or

139
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:03,159
inaccurate malware alerts you know

140
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,129
according to respondents an average of

141
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">three hundred ninety five hours is</font>

142
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:10,629
wasted each week detecting containing

143
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,989
malware because of false positives or

144
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:15,999
false negatives the extrapolated average

145
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:19,628
value on lost time is estimated to be

146
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:22,749
approximately 25,000 per week one point

147
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,999
to be seven million each year for

148
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:27,669
participating organizations there was a

149
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:30,309
survey that was done and here the brings

150
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,308
back what I said you have a an

151
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:34,659
organization is full all this wonderful

152
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:37,989
defense technologies you had your pants

153
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">your fire eyes your snorts your you name</font>

154
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:43,289
it and all that data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

155
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:45,369
scene right but then you need this does

156
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:48,248
balance this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people they're highly</font>

157
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:50,919
skills and almost like intuitively knows

158
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,889
what to look for right if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

159
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:55,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">I worked at a sock for 48 people and it</font>

160
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,789
would take<font color="#CCCCCC"> us between six to eight</font>

161
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:00,159
months to get somebody up and running

162
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,229
and if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in assault you</font>

163
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,959
know that the turnovers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year and a</font>

164
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">half hey so we're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about somebody</font>

165
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,589
you train for six seven months and last

166
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:12,759
another six months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it says</font>

167
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:16,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh-uh I'm going somewhere else right so</font>

168
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,909
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely a challenge and this</font>

169
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:22,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologies can definitely help to</font>

170
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:25,779
improve the texture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to provide us we</font>

171
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:27,429
mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tack on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

172
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:33,399
said that about how it sucks a challenge

173
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:35,828
they are training and to be honest until

174
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,789
we train them a<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get to a</font>

175
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:41,938
point where this technology evolves is

176
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,730
it comes down to people versus people

177
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:48,459
right the depot versus people means you

178
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,870
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> skilled person as somebody that can</font>

179
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,349
put yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the mindset of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

180
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,130
attacker against the

181
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">doctor and we would talk about that in</font>

182
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,670
the adversarial drift and how that

183
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,260
becomes a problem and it's a challenge

184
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:06,560
that can be tackled with machine

185
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:10,360
learning so machine learning is

186
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,130
basically a subfield of computer science

187
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,140
that basically evolved from the study of

188
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,580
pattern recognition and computational

189
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:21,230
learning theory in artificial

190
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:25,820
intelligence basically with machine

191
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:28,100
learning we have the ability to process

192
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,990
very large sets of data through

193
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,080
distributed computing plus the ability

194
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,740
to apply algorithms that can learn based

195
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,170
on dis large data sets and this provides

196
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysts with more meaningful detection</font>

197
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actionable items and you you're</font>

198
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about to see that so when we talk about</font>

199
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,880
algorithms or learners that's how they

200
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">are known machine learning what somebody</font>

201
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,850
says learner it means they're talking

202
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,580
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an algorithm so here's some some</font>

203
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,770
some generic definitions so it's a

204
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,530
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> set the rules to be followed in</font>

205
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:07,010
calculation or other problem solving

206
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,650
operations especially by a computer this

207
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,800
algorithms or learners can be designed

208
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,120
to develop or scale against all the

209
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,349
sources of data which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're</font>

210
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:22,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you one of the the</font>

211
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,280
advantages of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by applying</font>

212
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:28,250
machine learning you you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> complement</font>

213
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,130
a static base defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology so far</font>

214
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:33,920
we have been depending on on a static

215
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:37,250
signature base defense technologies and

216
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,870
telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cuz I I what I worked</font>

217
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,420
at I come out right snow routes all the

218
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,640
time and when we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at my work</font>

219
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,110
it was the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were looking at</font>

220
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,710
static stuff the attackers either adidas

221
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,110
or developing any type of malware will

222
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,490
obviously realize that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were creating</font>

223
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,680
signatures and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they will change it</font>

224
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,010
and this presents a challenge sometimes

225
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,630
during campaigns you have a window up to

226
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,370
10 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

227
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,470
signature that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know they're going</font>

228
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change</font>

229
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,990
so definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a challenge and we</font>

230
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,480
can use this new technologies to tackle

231
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,850
this problem so by applying this

232
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,610
learners you can also build models and

233
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:23,540
this moans can approach threads from a

234
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,930
multi contextual dynamic perspective so

235
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,949
we go beyond the static base security

236
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:34,969
technologies so with that I'm gonna

237
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,320
introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> my colleague and he's going to</font>

238
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:42,970
tell you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of also cleansing</font>

239
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,970
the security DNA you guys hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

240
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,739
so just to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> brief intro about me</font>

241
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,599
I'm a data scientist so I take a lot of

242
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:55,149
like the security language and I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

243
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,249
translate it to code basically and part

244
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,749
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part of the challenge in this</font>

245
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,609
problem space is usually when we're kind

246
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,109
of talking about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff particularly</font>

247
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:04,059
these slides are just for translations

248
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:05,829
of how we a lot of like conversations

249
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:07,389
we've had with customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically</font>

250
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,128
pivoting back and forth between three

251
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:11,529
languages which is sort of the security

252
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,569
centric language map mapping these

253
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,480
languages to an architect or a platform

254
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:18,040
and also kind of expressing them using

255
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,910
some some ideas like statistics and

256
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,279
machine learning and stuff so so kind of

257
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,259
how this presentation fell together is

258
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,790
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to put put some papers</font>

259
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,139
together for a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> called kdd</font>

260
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,879
which is like a machine learning

261
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,249
conference so there's so there could be

262
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,290
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit dense definitions</font>

263
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:36,609
and stuff in here but the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

264
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,040
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of translate some of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

265
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,989
these these terms that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

266
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,519
floating around a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

267
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:44,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">buzzwords particular machine learning</font>

268
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt and kind of map them back to</font>

269
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,419
your security intuition and sir one of

270
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,239
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting parts of working on</font>

271
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:54,669
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics or building like a big</font>

272
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:57,549
data application in cyber security or

273
00:12:54,669 --> 00:13:00,160
more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally in any problem space</font>

274
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,540
where you're modeling an adversary it's

275
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,219
really it's sort of a really interesting

276
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,169
like corner case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> artificial</font>

277
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,939
intelligence because essentially what

278
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:10,329
artificial intelligence is in some ways

279
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:11,559
it's just is taking a taking an

280
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:13,988
algorithm that's really good at

281
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,689
generalizing information about known

282
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:19,600
data or labeled data and so what what

283
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:21,279
what a label is is a really kind of key

284
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,360
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> input for any of these</font>

285
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,689
algorithms are going to be talking about

286
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in security particularly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you run</font>

287
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:29,289
in the problem of not having very many

288
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:32,618
labels that's already sort of like just

289
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:34,779
just kind of an accepted part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

291
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complex is the labels change over</font>

292
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:40,089

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,759
different scale so I spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

294
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:45,220
modeling like just kind of covert

295
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,769
channel type<font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoor communication see</font>

296
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,569
to the like malware beacons over the

297
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,759
last few years and and its really

298
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:53,769
interesting watching how like when we

299
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,259
used to model H tran and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of</font>

300
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,560
these sort of classic rats you could

301
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,230
kind of rely on honesty

302
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,760
sort of assumption of some kind of

303
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,620
callback behavior over time it might be

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,790
randomized<font color="#CCCCCC"> my but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there's</font>

305
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,710
going to be a footprint on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire at</font>

306
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,890
some point nowadays like the in-memory

307
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,630
malware that sort of persisted from from

308
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,150
the perimeter at web shells like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

309
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,529
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a couple</font>

310
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,010
years old now but it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CrowdStrike</font>

311
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:21,439
talk called beyond the indicator and and

312
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,490
I suggest you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like check it out if</font>

313
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some of these sort</font>

314
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,650
of like the drift in some of these

315
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,220
behaviors that that back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day you</font>

316
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:33,350
could just rely on on on on on a

317
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">backdoor kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of leaving a network</font>

318
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,650
footprint at some point now they're just

319
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,849
becoming much more stealthy in the sense

320
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:42,500
that once the malware is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

321
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,910
residing in memory and once the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP is</font>

322
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,250
done they can just drop it and there's

323
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,750
not even a<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system footprint so</font>

324
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,670
there's just this is what we call kind

325
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of adversarial drift over time the</font>

326
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,420
behavior of the model changes and then

327
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,980
the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing to be practical</font>

328
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,930
about so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I took</font>

329
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,600
from one of our security researchers

330
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,000
named monsey and and he uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

331
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,890
talk to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of to talk to customers</font>

332
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,950
about what it means to do defense at

333
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,710
scale across like a complex threat

334
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,450
surface so so so part of the issue when

335
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,150
you're doing like enterprise security is

336
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,410
is really we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about many</font>

337
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,880
things we're defending against are

338
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,560
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all kinds of different</font>

339
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack vectors all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

340
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,199
like depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on if your health in</font>

341
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,210
health care you got worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

342
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">know biomedical devices get getting</font>

343
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,980
compromised if you're in like like the

344
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,839
electric industry night now we work at

345
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,460
worried about IOT and and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

346
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,110
so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on kind of where you're</font>

347
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,860
positioned in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enterprise or in a</font>

348
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,600
particular sector um there's there's

349
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,209
many many types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats you have to</font>

350
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,070
worry about and then and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it</font>

351
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,449
kind of helps to to deal with this both

352
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,110
from a modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint and just from</font>

353
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security posture standpoint is mapping</font>

354
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,890
mapping kind of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security your</font>

355
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,449
defensive posture and your point

356
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,490
solutions or whatever defensive

357
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,440
components you have to a model<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

358
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,800
adversary<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I find this really useful</font>

359
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,100
in a very kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mature way to to sort</font>

360
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,400
of kind of break the space down a little

361
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,080
and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and and that hopefully</font>

362
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of the good takeaways we're</font>

363
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,360
going to walk you through sir what it

364
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,980
means to like a

365
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,680
fold a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little like machine learning our</font>

366
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,380
analytic just a real simple proof of

367
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,790
concept and the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you that</font>

368
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,829
when we're running these these

369
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,620
algorithms they're almost like hashes of

370
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,410
information you take a big piece of it

371
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,690
like labeled data and the output is

372
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,730
maybe a set of coefficients or a hash of

373
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,769
some encoded information that that we

374
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,300
then used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do predictions on and so in</font>

375
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,779
that sense there the brittle by

376
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,439
definition so analytics machine learning

377
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:45,200
all these buzzwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> we here I would say</font>

378
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,880
you know I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nation-state</font>

379
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we here at apt and some of these</font>

380
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,589
advanced threat actors that's a game of

381
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">human intelligence much more than it is</font>

382
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,850
automation we want to augment we want to

383
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,599
augment the human<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass as much as</font>

384
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,790
possible but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day it's</font>

385
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,220
much easier to build a machine learning

386
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,418
and analytic on like exploit kit samples

387
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that's what we've been doing for</font>

388
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:12,319
black hat we grab like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 labeled</font>

389
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,140
exploit chains and and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

390
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,760
actual like payload delivery and I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

391
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,980
and it's because it's generalized across

392
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,660
many exploit kits<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's</font>

393
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,419
there's some invariant behaviors in this

394
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,160
in this and there's a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of threat</font>

395
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,780
vector and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of think it's it</font>

396
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,299
kind of falls a little bit more in here

397
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,918
where we're not we're not dealing with

398
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,440
adversaries who have like lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

399
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,370
resources who can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change and and</font>

400
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">really stealthily hide their tactics so</font>

401
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:43,879
so anyway just to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like dive into</font>

402
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:47,210
what what what we're doing here it's

403
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,190
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying to accelerate some</font>

404
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,250
classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflows like I've been kind of</font>

405
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,160
doing this off and on more or less at

406
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,940
from I like a consulting standpoint just

407
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,470
building custom solutions on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

408
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> first-generation sem data when when</font>

409
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sem dated like like what happened</font>

410
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,770
with first-generation<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam like q radar</font>

411
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,659
envision some of these big systems that

412
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,940
were sort of classic inputs to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

413
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,640
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different data sources this is sort</font>

414
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:19,970
of like how the sock in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last last</font>

415
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,220
decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so was basically landing all</font>

416
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,169
all the the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

417
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,269
normalization standpoint and

418
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,669
kind of triaging and escalating

419
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,710
incidents in a day-to-day work flow so

420
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,299
kind of spending time in the sock you

421
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,669
sort of realize there's a lot of these

422
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,350
pain points and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roderick touched on part</font>

423
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,869
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is just sort of like like if you</font>

424

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,960
an analyst and and this the search space

435
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:01,220
is pretty it's pretty creative in some

436
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,259
sense that's why one in the heart this

437
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,960
is a hard problem to map to like an

438
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,970
automated solution because really

439
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,330
depending on like the piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of evidence</font>

440
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,759
the use case we're talking about we you

441
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,279
know we we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adjust our kind of</font>

442
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,609
search patterns and what it means to to

443
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:22,789
verify a an event as a true positive or

444
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:24,350
false positive essentially so but but

445
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:26,720
there is benefit like we like I think

446
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:31,609
that the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the message we're</font>

447
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,210
learning is is for one certain problems

448
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:38,330
kind of will naturally be be helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

449
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,009
but by some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of algorithm that that</font>

450
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,840
is essentially what what I look like to

451
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:46,039
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's like an optimization</font>

452
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,269
really so so so so so basically so

453
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,429
here's we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of walk</font>

454
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,139
through before we sort of show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

455
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:53,179
how we're applying these algorithms to

456
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:55,279
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like am a central nervous system</font>

457
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,629
approach at scale this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of like</font>

458
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,950
what's what's happening with any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

459
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:01,549
these algorithms if we talked about in

460
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,499
some sense so uh basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

461
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,840
of like a really hacky way to describe

462
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:08,659
like a whole you know body of knowledge

463
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,189
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's this idea in machine</font>

464
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:12,080
learning like formerly called VC

465
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,220
dimension and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is sort of</font>

466
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,840
like if your interest in the definition

467
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">like mathematically this is where we're</font>

468
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,439
talking about here basically if you

469
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:20,090
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what what it means to learn</font>

470
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,980
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do this in our brain</font>

471
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,350
because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to learn like</font>

472
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,190
something's dangerous every time you

473
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:29,600
encounter<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like like it we take hashes</font>

474
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,249
of the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're able to do</font>

475
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,019
quick look up so that I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh a lion</font>

476
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:35,539
is going to kill me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

477
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,429
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having to sort of reprocess</font>

478
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,490
that and so that's kind of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font>

479
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,260
with data to with

480
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,140
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you know in a learning</font>

481
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:46,080
workflow is is you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of input</font>

482
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,970
data and and there's some some brain or

483
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
some algorithm that process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the input</font>

484
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,290
and it sort of creates like an encoding

485
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,480
of what what that input really means in

486
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,570
some generalized sort of feature space

487
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,809
and so kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just really</font>

488
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">quickly um basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what i just did</font>

489
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:07,139
here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took sort of like are the</font>

490
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">this sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source statistical</font>

491
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,559
programming environment and basically I

492
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,960
just these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like default data sets</font>

493
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,480
and are so so all we did here was take

494
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,850
an input data set<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's something to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

495
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,770
with like cars it just has a bunch of

496
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stats about cars and basically</font>

497
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,850
what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we fit a model this is</font>

498
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">about as simple as a model as you can</font>

499
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,659
have in kind of these these predictive

500
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,950
models and it's call it's just a linear

501
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">model so it's a regression you're</font>

502
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,030
basically fitting a line given a couple

503
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,740
of predictors so so these are sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

504
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the variables we are saying is</font>

505
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,630
basically saying we want to model miles

506
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,510
per gallon as sort of a linear

507
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">combination of a couple of key variables</font>

508
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,770
which is weight displacement and a

509
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:48,420
cylinder number I'm but at the end of

510
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,639
the day what the point is what we're

511
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,010
trying to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we take some input we</font>

512
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
we model it with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

513
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,240
output of this this this whole process

514
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,280
is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like these coefficients</font>

515
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,559
describe the line that we learned so now

516
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take a new data point and I</font>

517
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,340
predict using this model I'm not using

518
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hole this big data set anymore I'm</font>

519
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">just basically reading off this hash and</font>

520
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,830
saying oh yes are we on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line are we</font>

521
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,820
over it are we out so you can you can

522
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,139
get a lot of information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

523
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,270
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more information</font>

524
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">than here this metadata there's sort of</font>

525
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,410
like have to kind of like assign

526
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,940
significance and p-values and stuff but

527
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:25,650
in any case like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of like</font>

528
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">a real kind of happy way to explain the</font>

529
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,010
learning compression duality so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

530
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,080
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a lot</font>

531
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,910
about machine learning and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzz</font>

532
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">word that's thrown around a lot but from</font>

533
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,300
a security standpoint and from any

534
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:40,440
problem space where you're dealing with

535
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,928
a sort of changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time over the</font>

536
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,940
underlying ground truth and it more and

537
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">also like adversarial drift then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

538
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,390
say this is this is like something we

539
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,490
have to use very carefully and because

540
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,730
it's a brittle process from from this

541
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,080
from the slides oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so here you</font>

542
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,550
know if we have time i'll show you the

543
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,230
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were writing for this black</font>

544
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,030
hat project and basically what we're

545
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,040
using it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like well known that</font>

546
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,660
random forest is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of learning</font>

547
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,149
algorithm you basically give it some

548
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,950
input in just like the the linear model

549
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,240
it's going to give us a prediction that

550
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,010
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of what we're going to use</font>

551
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's kind of best in breed if</font>

552
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,090
you know all the things being equal if

553
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,860
we don't know anything else sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

554
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,620
I didn't try it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of</font>

555
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:22,820
time and a lot of this stuff we're doing

556
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,800
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like as a side note is</font>

557
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,450
basically the last two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years since since</font>

558
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,909
we've been part of the startup and spunk

559
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,670
we've been leveraging a lot of open

560
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,690
source Apache project so all these

561
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,850
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about we are</font>

562
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,550
essentially built with either patchy

563
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:44,370
storm or patchy spark and some other

564
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:46,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like FML lib so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's</font>

565
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:51,199
this might be a little bit dense but

566
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:53,429
this is her basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this came from a</font>

567
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,750
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> called kdd which is like a</font>

568
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,510
machine learning conference so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

569
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">already kind of really academic and I</font>

570
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,080
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did my like grad school and stuff</font>

571
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,790
in math so this is like some of the

572
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,409
definitions here come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're</font>

573
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not security at all like particularly</font>

574
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:10,410
probably well yeah I mean the space of

575
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,210
possible behaviors is a continuum at

576
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,700
this point like I I like I say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

577
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,020
lot up to customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

578
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,170
worthless statement but in some sense

579
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,910
like there's a lot of depth to this

580
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:25,380
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of represents up the</font>

581
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:28,470
pattern we've been using to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to to</font>

582
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,240
take an enterprise and decompose their

583
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,720
their threat surface into actionable

584
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,360
units of of kind of like TTP's

585
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,400
essentially or or just a set of patterns

586
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,070
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> model with an analytic</font>

587
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,710
or just augment a point solution signal

588
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,290
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of how we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

589
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">express this this pattern in a really</font>

590
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,800
high level workflow that was meant for a

591
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,530
paper but that's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font>

592
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and break down in some sense so but</font>

593
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,690
basically from a high level we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

594
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:01,440
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a threat surface what I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

595
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">third surface</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just really quick is that</font>

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,379
find it so like a threat like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

597
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,360
kind of a bad picture but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

598
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:11,610
particular like environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I used</font>

599
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show this slide to a couple like like</font>

600
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,110
large fortune 500 companies when they

601
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,509
would talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like the 30 use cases</font>

602
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,240
they want wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to model and and and</font>

603
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of handle from them just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

604
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,600
like where their sock didn't have

605
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,189
visibility like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes are like a</font>

606
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,389
great like question that comes up is

607
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,490
like how do we get more visibility an

608
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:32,129
SSL traffic or how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we were</font>

609
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,710
at we have like you know some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

610
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:36,959
covert channels over SSL<font color="#CCCCCC"> or how can we</font>

611
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,720
better find<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass the ticket or golden</font>

612
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,610
ticket just<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the use case it</font>

613
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,350
turns out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of</font>

614
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,379
enumerate the thread surface and then

615
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,678
just start assigning either models or or

616
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:56,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh the way it's kind of described in</font>

617
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,480
this this workflow is a family models so

618
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:01,169
so yeah so in any case if anyone sort of

619
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,509
curious about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper or something</font>

620
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's sort of a work in progress but</font>

621
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:06,840
you know come talk to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> afterwards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

622
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,789
give you a copy of hidden stuff it's

623
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,620
it's a little bit dense though but

624
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:12,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically kind of like what ends up</font>

625
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,049
happening from a practical standpoint is

626
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:17,850
what we're mapping essentially there's

627
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,350
two computational workflows especially

628
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,029
in these big data systems that are call

629
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,939
it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and batch workflows</font>

630
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:26,370
and and it turns out that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

631
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,049
take any arbitrary behavior basically

632
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,959
you can kind of break them down into two

633
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,029
sets of things essentially the

634
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,149
sequential behaviors and non sequential

635
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:42,200
behaviors and and and if you if you sort

636
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of expose this in the right way there's</font>

637
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:53,370
there's basically like a system of of

638
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,049
workflows that map like that map out how

639
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,000
these how these behaviors are computed

640
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:58,740
and it be it sort of becomes like an

641
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,320
architecture question at this point so

642
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,750
essentially what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been doing from a</font>

643
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:06,178
modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint is tape taking like</font>

644
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,519
a real time engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

645
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:12,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a patchy storm and then blending it</font>

646
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:14,080
with a batch engine and and then

647
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,450
what happens is in this in this batch

648
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,800
computational framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that the</font>

649
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,480
thing that the reason we're sort of

650
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,760
structuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this way is all these</font>

651
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,070
sort of projects like<font color="#E5E5E5"> are highly</font>

652
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,500
scalable on commodity hardware so you

653
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,710
know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of clusters or</font>

654
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:32,590
the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs i have is sort of like</font>

655
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,180
was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scale linearly across the</font>

656
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,949
number of users<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm analyzing in a whole</font>

657
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like</font>

658
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,990
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is like in</font>

659
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-generation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sem there was basically</font>

660
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,040
bottlenecks because because these things

661
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">were stood up on on on relational</font>

662
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,030
database backends so you can't do like a

663
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,650
complex analyte query like a good

664
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,480
example is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> page rank like an</font>

665
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,980
algorithm like page rank or some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

666
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,290
these algorithms that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really graph</font>

667
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,090
heavy that process like really they're

668
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,040
basically large combinatorial

669
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,020
optimization problems or just large

670
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,409
problems whether they don't scale well

671
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,860
across a relational database and and so

672
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,420
we're kind of taking that that that pain

673
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,580
that sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been felt in the</font>

674
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,290
enterprise for the last few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

675
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,169
we're trying to kind of optimized around

676
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,420
it so so when you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of decouple the</font>

677
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,190
mutability of a transactional related

678
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,080
relational database in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend of</font>

679
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">these architectures then it lets you</font>

680
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,169
scale out much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complex analytic</font>

681
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:33,010
computations across individual users so

682
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:35,650
now essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i do per per user</font>

683
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assign like a thread a</font>

684
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:41,440
thread<font color="#E5E5E5"> of memory or state per user in</font>

685
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:46,209
sort of a highly parallelized way and

686
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i just wanted to jump around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

687
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,590
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's more like I kind of</font>

688
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,640
jumped ahead because probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

689
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">have started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this picture because</font>

690
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is sort of like what we're getting</font>

691
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,120
after it is for a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> month for a</font>

692
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,710
particular use case like I mean

693
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,030
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not users it could be IP</font>

694
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,580
addresses it could be anything that's

695
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:07,000
sort of a primary key but but basically

696
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:11,169
I want to study there like a particular

697
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,120
entities behavior over time either<font color="#E5E5E5"> / /</font>

698
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,310
sort of a batch workflow or a sequential

699
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,379
workflow so in this case this is sort of

700
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,990
a real time computation where we're

701
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,840
doing the analysis of exploit chains and

702
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:26,060
basically what would an expert chain is

703
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,980
in some ways is just a

704
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,980
set of like interesting request that

705
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,900
will happen in a short amount of time

706
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,330
and if you start breaking down like the

707
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,880
mime types and looking at there's an

708
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:40,070
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here yeah so here's an</font>

709
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,330
exploit basically an exploit sequence

710
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,700
that happens in a really short amount

711
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,179
time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this comes from like a some</font>

712
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:50,990
kind of exploit kit sample from<font color="#E5E5E5"> contagio</font>

713
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:53,420
but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is here like if we look at</font>

714
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:56,180
the mime types yeah so it's a text I

715
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,280
here's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash exploit they're</font>

716
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,020
dropping a payload and this might even

717
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,090
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> see to at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point so like</font>

718
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,460
basically this happens in a really small

719
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of time if you're a firewall and</font>

720
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,590
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like sitting in line like</font>

721
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,740
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all these logs well the</font>

722
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,270
problem you have is that like there's

723
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be other people kind of in</font>

724
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,600
between stuff in between here so you

725
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,639
haven't sort of sequenced the right way

726
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,530
like basically like it's hard for

727
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,380
firewalls to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep state across multiple</font>

728
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,090
users at the same time or anything in

729
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,730
line because<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically hardware only has</font>

730
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,709
so much memory so what happens is

731
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,630
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like letting the hardware the</font>

732
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,820
point solutions have to maintain a bunch

733
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> state for every user environment we</font>

734
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,750
just land these<font color="#E5E5E5"> logs you know to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam</font>

735
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,510
or four you know it basically like a

736
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,510
data warehouse and we're able to kind of

737
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:48,649
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially group by in sort I</font>

738
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,930
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's all that's sort of</font>

739
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,870
happening here but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this</font>

740
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,330
this sort of sequence of flows now let's

741
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,310
just get a really simple picture and and

742
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,820
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like essentially one use</font>

743
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:04,760
case it may be in in a bunch of

744
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">different models that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on the</font>

745
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,280
sequential side of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's kind</font>

746
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,530
of like I mean that's more or less sort

747
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,820
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the moral of the story at a high</font>

748
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,810
level here what we're trying to convey

749
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,120
the just a comment about that old dishes

750
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,740
don't by centralizing remember what I

751
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,739
said at first that how we have all the

752
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,840
similar sources of data right and then

753
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,410
we you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> this tone sir blocks like</font>

754
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,120
what we just saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ending the</font>

755
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,790
sequence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the X below the display</font>

756
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,669
chain you can you really can't do that

757
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,570
if you have a a stock analyst you had to

758
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,810
look at multiple sources I

759
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:46,260
to go to firewall has<font color="#CCCCCC"> two maybe TCP dump</font>

760
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:51,320
maybe fire I whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is but it's</font>

761
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:53,160
very dissimilar by us concentrate is in

762
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,020
sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to do some video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

763
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what a</font>

764
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">TLS is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called extract transform and load</font>

765
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically we're getting all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the similar</font>

766
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,690
data sources and put it in into

767
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,590
something that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understood and</font>

768
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:10,800
then process by doing that then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

769
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:13,649
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm to it pulling for</font>

770
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,570
all this multiple sources right so we

771
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just don't depend on just a firewall</font>

772
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,850
anymore or or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> an expert I the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

773
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:23,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">PRIZE you needed to train the algorithm</font>

774
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,870
which he can tell you a little bit and

775
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,560
you see how the algorithm sometimes you

776
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:31,080
have to feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> them with benign data so</font>

777
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,870
then they can tell what malicious data

778
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,290
is so that's the context<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

779
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,899
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

780
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,000
actually with the algorithms that look

781
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:45,600
there is the sequence of mine types we

782
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,400
have the text HTML flash or PDF and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

783
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,770
you have octet stream and then you have

784
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,990
some sort of a outbound or even ssl but

785
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you got door did that happens</font>

786
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,860
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> or an exploit change so so if you</font>

787
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,929
you can combine that with other things

788
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:02,399
such as you have 80 lakhs for example

789
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:04,800
you get a lot of a bunch of 440 think

790
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 4624 which is usually related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font>

791
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hash or any other type of AD event</font>

792
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">where work that would spike at the same</font>

793
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,300
time that this was happening or

794
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:17,610
sequentially then this gives you a

795
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,620
strong indicator that something is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

796
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,330
on whereas when I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font>

797
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,399
dissimilar resources or I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

798
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">sim which had to constantly query and</font>

799
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,660
it's based on a relational database like

800
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,210
he just said there are limitations on

801
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,410
getting to it so don't know if you want

802
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,090
to add a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the training on</font>

803
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,710
the algorithms yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

804
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,590
essentially you know so part of what

805
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">were I mean I jumped around a little but</font>

806
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:43,560
basically the the goal here is

807
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,970
describing a system that from a like if

808
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,190
we're just talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like Silicon</font>

809
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,380
Valley terms would this is a reference

810
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,269
to in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> valleys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called like a lambda</font>

811
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,179
architecture which is a reference to

812
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:56,769
a term Nathan Mars coin when he was

813
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:59,109
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storm project at twitter</font>

814
00:33:56,769 --> 00:34:00,459
twitter and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a whole</font>

815
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:03,309
interesting history here this is really

816
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:05,529
where the the the big data in some sense

817
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:06,940
is very bleeding edge and basically what

818
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:08,529
we're taking advantage of the fact that

819
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,659
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> first generation bottlenecks</font>

820
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:12,699
that are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known and security</font>

821
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:16,569
workflows we're kind of decoupling those

822
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom bottlenecks bye-bye by leveraging</font>

823
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:21,579
immutability in these different

824
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:24,250
workflows in a very very nice way so the

825
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:26,319
mutable side of all the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in</font>

826
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,940
this kind of real-time path and and and

827
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,829
because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um a lot of things</font>

828
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:32,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">become really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really clean when you got</font>

829
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:35,349
to scale it so one of the things that

830
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:37,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens on these systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is their</font>

831
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:39,000
learning system so then now we have to

832
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:41,589
answer from an engineering standpoint

833
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,719
like what does it mean when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're I'm</font>

834
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:46,089
not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have broad like or an</font>

835
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,859
analyst sitting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of telling</font>

836
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:50,799
models to do things like kicking off a

837
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:52,299
job having a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relearn so we have</font>

838
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,520
to answer all these questions from an

839
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:57,880
automated from from from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

840
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,279
perspective basically and and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

841
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,410
implement something that that this whole

842
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,760
platform is monitoring so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

843
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,710
the system we're working on that's a

844
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,569
commercial application there's about 50

845
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,670
models right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that that's really</font>

846
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the power of these systems that</font>

847
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,690
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way they're</font>

848
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,660
going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything for an enterprise</font>

849
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:19,299
is if you you augment it like existing

850
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,750
signals with with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of many</font>

851
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:24,250
kind of analytics that are blended

852
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,869
blended together essentially and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

853
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,880
these models talk to each other their

854
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">first-class citizens we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> skala</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soar</font>

855
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,750
there it's a very expressive language

856
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,970
and basically all these like so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

857
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,309
write a command and control model I can

858
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,770
kind of subscribe to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> output of other</font>

859
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:40,180
models that that are focusing on on

860
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,119
similar use cases are just maybe

861
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,129
tracking users and and and combining the

862
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,730
output of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer groups for different</font>

863
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,500
users with kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what a typical</font>

864
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,270
covert channel looks like gives you just

865
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically augments lots of signals</font>

866
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:56,470
together and so there's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean there's</font>

867
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,299
there's an API that does all the

868
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,430
learning for us if anyone's it's kind of

869
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:03,119
like them this is for like another dense

870
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,069
topic but basically we sort of have a a

871
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,530
hole for any model

872
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,080
how we updated in parallel is basically

873
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,850
like a map and reduce kind of a workflow

874
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,200
so so if anyone's pretty interesting

875
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,509
this like really technical date details

876
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is come come come talk to me this is</font>

877
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,590
part of this paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can send you if</font>

878
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,670
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested um you're a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

879
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:26,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yes usage oh yeah yeah because I</font>

880
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:31,120
wanna see if we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show the</font>

881
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:32,319
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> too ok so this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

882
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,480
obviously the community is very

883
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,690
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so what is that the</font>

884
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,270
extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear things such</font>

885
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:43,450
as overfitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on underfitting however</font>

886
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:45,700
fitting is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you see that</font>

887
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:49,089
sequence of mime types what it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

888
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:52,000
there's flash and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they</font>

889
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,730
said text then there is HTML there is

890
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,740
flash there is sometimes there's Adobe

891
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,760
there's an octet stream well overfitting

892
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,569
would be for example if you have

893
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,780
sometimes like a CD ends cns become a

894
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:07,450
problem because some of them behave like

895
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:11,290
botnets<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you actually look at the</font>

896
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,060
sequence of connections then the

897
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:16,150
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> starts saying hey there's an</font>

898
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,040
exploit here so we have that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

899
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,770
the challenges oh it's called over

900
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,140
overfitting right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a certain</font>

901
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:26,410
sequences and start basically

902
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,890
transferring that so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

903
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,299
benign traffic like CDM or your<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

904
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,930
streaming or sometimes what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

905
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,200
users are using certain api's in the end

906
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:40,509
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> API is have your I strange that</font>

907
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,830
suggests errs commands and sometimes

908
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,420
that becomes a challenge for the

909
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,650
algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that ok what this looks</font>

910
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,980
like an exploit so that's call

911
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:50,770
overfitting underfitting is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

912
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:53,470
opposite of it which is the model is not

913
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,660
trained and off right so like we said

914
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,299
before before we get you get those

915
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:02,200
models ready you had to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

916
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:05,100
produce a behavior a benign type of

917
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,470
benchmarks so the mall knows what is

918
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,480
normal and then you had to train on what

919
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,850
is my line<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's how eventually the</font>

920
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,400
algorithm can tell okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is good or</font>

921
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:19,600
this is bad but yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still had to</font>

922
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,220
tackle challenges and those are

923
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,450
principally for for detection they're

924
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,549
very important the overfitting

925
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">underfitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because then what happens</font>

926
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,570
is and this is from personal experience

927
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,910
the the overfitting stone is giving you

928
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,260
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of false positives and then once</font>

929
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,210
you start getting the false positives

930
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,270
then people start saying okay well

931
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,010
you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex-brother i'm not i mean</font>

932
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,250
there's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess we can put a name</font>

933
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:45,560
to each of them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is full of</font>

934
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:49,010
like somebody told me my not was getting

935
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,460
so many alerts from<font color="#E5E5E5"> X product that we</font>

936
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,050
stop looking at them right that is a

937
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,600
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there that we're trying</font>

938
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tackle this so what is the response</font>

939
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,450
to that the response is to refine the

940
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,820
algorithm I for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a model</font>

941
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that checks would be the HTTP one is</font>

942
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:11,270
white / 24 type of indicators micro

943
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:13,130
behaviors oh yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's like 60</font>

944
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:16,580
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's like 60 features in</font>

945
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,230
every single HTTP connection it looks at

946
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,970
60 features in checked checked checked

947
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,550
checked and then it does and that's the

948
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,799
digital calculation it says likely this

949
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,380
is benign or likely this is when this is

950
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,770
done in real time that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like i</font>

951
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:33,020
said before things like Hadoop is is

952
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:36,650
wonderful because this what has allow us

953
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,660
to get to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point the technology</font>

954
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,730
obviously as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have said it this is not</font>

955
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,670
a panacea this is like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw in</font>

956
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:47,270
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra screen about once we go to</font>

957
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:51,380
APD just pretty much is very difficult

958
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">right even by by applying the</font>

959
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,460
statistical logic right because you just

960
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly say you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to feed a bunch of</font>

961
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,250
data so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones occurrence</font>

962
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,010
how would you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a targeted</font>

963
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:07,930
operation if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a binary has never been</font>

964
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:10,580
seen anywhere no IP rep no<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus total</font>

965
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:13,060
see there are limitations that we

966
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,549
obviously have to tackle but there is

967
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,750
what we're looking at at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> place is</font>

968
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,970
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is we're in early stages</font>

969
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we're looking more like the basic</font>

970
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:25,759
behaviors of detection sup one that we

971
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,879
believe eventually this in five years

972
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,810
will probably replace suck one so if you

973
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,590
are at someone right now you may work

974
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:37,029
since up though because so too is so

975
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,430
three you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to learn and</font>

976
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,370
take advantage from this from this

977
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:46,169
technology but definitely I telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

978
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:48,700
is common and not only in just a log

979
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:53,890
area but in the network area and many

<font color="#E5E5E5">other decision type defense or detection</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that you really need a level of skill</font>

that you had to put together and they

990
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,740
had new ecosystem in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

docker it's up and running so that is

994
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:35,050
definitely a challenge and things like

AWS and clothe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in my opinion or a</font>

streamlining and using this technology

998
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,010
and obviously we had like we showed the

other<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry oh drift where'd you know</font>

00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:58,990
continue adapting and improving their

1003
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,870
their attacks however it isn't our

1004
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:05,770
opinion as as we train the algorithms

1005
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:09,549
and as we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather more data</font>

1006
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and apply it and improve algorithms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1007
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:16,900
detection rate will improve would you

1008
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:20,859
like to show which you can we show the a

1009
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:23,950
little bit of the code or so basically

1010
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:28,680
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you saw before we show a</font>

1011
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:31,390
like a sequence of exploit chain and

1012
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,690
what we will show you now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a tool</font>

1013
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:37,270
that we're going to release this

1014
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,300
afternoon that basically you will apply

1015
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,890
this to pick ups<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it will tell</font>

1016
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,250
you what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the likelihood that there is</font>

1017
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,910
an exploit chain

1018
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:48,320
ransomware and we will publish it we

1019
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,270
want to give it a waiter a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1020
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">community can work on it and improve it</font>

1021
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:58,850
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the nice things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

1022
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:02,950
was from the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this tool</font>

1023
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:06,980
basically we created a script that SSH<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1024
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:09,410
have a domain laboratory we have the

1025
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:13,430
main controller basically you can grab

1026
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:17,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D for example the name of the</font>

1027
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:19,640
executable create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell conlon</font>

1028
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:21,830
ssh into the domain controller<font color="#CCCCCC"> put your</font>

1029
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">GP 0 and then update the GPO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the GPO</font>

1030
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:28,100
will prevent from executing that

1031
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,420
malicious executable that you will get

1032
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,799
just from because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just have to feed</font>

1033
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,510
at the pickups and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the two scripts</font>

1034
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,660
were doing so it's like an active

1035
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:38,240
defense script yeah so so basically what

1036
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:41,899
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kind of show is part part</font>

1037
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the biggest like the most painful</font>

1038
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of these workflows from like a any</font>

1039
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:50,000
analytics application is creating this

1040
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,220
label right here so like off like what

1041
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,960
we had to do basically and this is kind

1042
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,609
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're open sourcing oftentimes</font>

1043
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,560
the hardest part from like a security

1044
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">research standpoint for like big data is</font>

1045
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,779
getting data that has the labels here so

1046
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,310
we we had like some security researcher

1047
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,460
basically had to go through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> p</font>

1048
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:08,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kapoor each you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know like call back or</font>

1049
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,670
essentially kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of layer 7 HTTP flow</font>

1050
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,650
and kind of label you know good or bad

1051
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,810
malicious or benign so that's basically

1052
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,630
one sweet this once once you have these

1053
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,250
labels that's when when kind of machine

1054
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,170
learning becomes really applicable but

1055
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">even when you don't have it like like</font>

1056
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's and that's why it's for me often</font>

1057
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,629
times it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an optimization because</font>

1058
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">I like we sat down this is sort of like</font>

1059
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:34,160
a like a the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full kind of compute</font>

1060
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:35,480
that we do per domain didn't fit on the

1061
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,310
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like a</font>

1062
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple examples but we compute like a</font>

1063
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,820
bunch of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you</font>

1064
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:43,670
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in the code but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1065
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,980
these were sort of hand tuned by some

1066
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">mannion guys really you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rod like</font>

1067
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,190
just security researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

1068
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,420
mapping their intuition<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they hunt</font>

1069
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,860
hunt for to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightweight code and</font>

1070
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,690
what we ended up doing at first was just

1071
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,280
designing an algorithm that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1072
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,270
some of these manually so we didn't use

1073
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,220
any machine learning we just use a

1074
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:03,859
heuristic and we said okay you know what

1075
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,689
domain is bad if a<font color="#CCCCCC"> G d's are like a</font>

1076
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:07,069
classic kind of computation here if we

1077
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,260
see sort of randomly generated domains

1078
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:11,450
that's kind of risky if you see like a

1079
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,550
high number of null web referral high

1080
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,259
number of you know user agents if you

1081
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,240
see kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird mime type extension</font>

1082
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,490
pairs just a bunch of little things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1083
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,479
you can kind of just adds the overall

1084
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:25,098
risk so so just real quick so basically

1085
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're kind of like on this repo</font>

1086
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:29,359
I'll show you we just have a bunch of

1087
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,089
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets like par some of</font>

1088
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,980
them are just rod just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing benign</font>

1089
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,750
traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's labeling it and then</font>

1090
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the algorithms you know the</font>

1091
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,819
algorithms can use that as input along

1092
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:46,720
with the exploit kit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see</font>

1093
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:46,720
here the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1094
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,700
oh sorry

1095
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:01,990
so just I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of show you very</font>

1096
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:11,220
quickly like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it mean to build</font>

1097
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:11,220
these like little oops sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1098
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:26,740
so like at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day better</font>

1099
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,150
example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I'm going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1100
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:33,910
full screen I just got to find one

1101
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:37,180
little thing here at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

1102
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:38,529
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would like what's what's</font>

1103
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of doing this just versus</font>

1104
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:51,670
using like a regex or kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a snort</font>

1105
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:54,580
rule or something man sorry so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

1106
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of hard to see but basically</font>

1107
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,569
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're sort of able to do so</font>

1108
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,029
kind of like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown you with</font>

1109
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:04,000
this like this like all of this row of

1110
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">each domain is we basically have these</font>

1111
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,780
rules for different like different

1112
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,300
behaviors<font color="#E5E5E5"> or computing about a</font>

1113
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,850
particular use case and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is i</font>

1114
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,590
can just for exploitation for you our

1115
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,450
eyes I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of studied the data I looked</font>

1116
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,400
at these exploit samples and just derive

1117
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,399
some simple features and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1118
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,410
mapping this in a workflow that now this

1119
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:27,160
is sort of what the learning algorithm

1120
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,589
is keying in on and and and the power

1121
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,750
here is this is very expressive i can

1122
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,070
write down<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything I want it doesn't</font>

1123
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a regex it doesn't have to be</font>

1124
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,720
a snort rule but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can at like you can</font>

1125
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,390
add snort rules in i can say did I match

1126
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,339
on some level of criticality we match on

1127
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,040
like we blend everything we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been Palo</font>

1128
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,990
Alto rules like symantec AV hits this

1129
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,310
all kind of come in so you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1130
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:53,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">holistic view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the world and and so</font>

1131
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know from a demo perspective</font>

1132
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,080
let me just show you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what the</font>

1133
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,080
output is

1134
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,490
sir

1135
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,950
ok one last thing

1136
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:38,369
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like so I'm just at</font>

1137
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:47,069
the jar here and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of show</font>

1138
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:49,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like like the okay so basically if</font>

1139
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:52,170
you if you clone this repo what's the

1140
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:55,049
most valuable here is what's in data so

1141
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,670
this is um this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of the</font>

1142
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:58,559
work here the code is just as proof of

1143
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,929
concept some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas it shows an</font>

1144
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,150
end to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> an 10 thing but but the the</font>

1145
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:04,289
real value here is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of already kind</font>

1146
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of going through this and labeling this</font>

1147
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:11,369
stuff and then so what we do you see

1148
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,829
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is it big enough okay</font>

1149
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:18,509
basically I mean what I'm going to do is

1150
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:22,109
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run through a demo ah oh man forgot</font>

1151
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:23,759
to put one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks in there but</font>

1152
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:25,558
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's doing right now is</font>

1153
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:27,929
the first step of like a learning

1154
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,539
algorithm is<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data so i just</font>

1155
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:32,039
pointed to a directory and it's just

1156
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:34,170
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to going to like crawl the</font>

1157
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:36,869
directory and and in this case it's

1158
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:38,849
taking each labeled exploit exploit

1159
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:39,989
sample and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deriving some of</font>

1160
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:43,140
those those features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i showed you</font>

1161
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:45,269
in a kind of previous like sorting in

1162
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:49,379
the development environment and then so

1163
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:52,529
we take some some good data or should I

1164
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:56,400
malicious data there's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 350 or so</font>

1165
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:58,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">samples and then we we learn from that</font>

1166
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,449
and then we learn from labeled benign

1167
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:02,630
traffic samples and we build a model out

1168
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:05,279
both those and then and then when we

1169
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:09,329
want to score something this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

1170
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:10,829
little fast but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um what happens is kind</font>

1171
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:12,719
of here's the key here's the key

1172
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:14,429
prediction step so I just passed a new

1173
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:15,959
model it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was basically a new this like a</font>

1174
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,579
ransom or sample that someone gave us

1175
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:20,368
those like deck it had the exploitation

1176
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:21,749
in it and and it just kind of goes to

1177
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:25,199
show that if you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deployed this</font>

1178
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:27,089
in line the output<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually like an</font>

1179
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:29,009
IOC of JSON so when we see a good

1180
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:31,078
prediction like okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad then</font>

1181
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:33,479
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us some some indicators we're just</font>

1182
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">grabbing like the IPS that domains and</font>

1183
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:38,428
the files in the in this in the pcap

1184
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:40,019
right now and then we're passing it to

1185
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:42,260
like another upstream workflow that's

1186
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:44,459
kind of part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like sexy</font>

1187
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,070
automated response in this case we just

1188
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,330
created automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPO object that's</font>

1189
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially sort of like you know</font>

1190
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically if you have like 50</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or 60 of</font>

1191
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:55,170
these workflows that's that any blending

1192
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,240
them all together that's sort of when

1193
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:59,670
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things become you know practical</font>

1194
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,189
for enterprise but otherwise it's it's

1195
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:05,460
sort of hard to to scale some of these

1196
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:15,060
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> down but I think we're not</font>

1197
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:17,430
where else<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay QA any questions you</font>

1198
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:21,090
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the older version is like</font>

1199
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:23,910
on on our LinkedIn and maybe the old

1200
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:26,490
besides the obesity yeah we can we can

1201
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:29,460
upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the github and this will be</font>

1202
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:32,129
uploaded is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zero is it available</font>

1203
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,690
now or yeah maybe we'll put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1204
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,190
github so that wasn't gonna get home

1205
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:38,040
we'll put the tool we're gonna put the

1206
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,750
white paper so you can read a little

1207
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,940
more technical where we got all this

1208
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,220
indicators from and then we're gonna

1209
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,960
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the power points as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1210
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,240
we're done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the with black hat</font>

1211
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">arsenal today so you just saw a preview</font>

1212
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,479
of it no you know I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really</font>

1213
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,600
give this to vsauce because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1214
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and amazing cumference so</font>

1215
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,890

1217
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,920
but we didn't have a link in the other

1218
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,870
slide deck but that's where most of the

1219
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:13,700
stuff is living yeah here so yeah yeah

1220
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:13,700
