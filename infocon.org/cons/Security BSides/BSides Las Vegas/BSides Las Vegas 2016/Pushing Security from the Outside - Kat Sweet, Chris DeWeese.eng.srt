1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,589
so our next talk is on pushing security

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:16,590
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris to ease please</font>

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:18,600
give Chris around the plus baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,880
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old everybody from my way who's</font>

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,789
out here how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here actually</font>

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,778
work in the security field oh ok how

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people don't work in security too</font>

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,149
ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so I have something for both</font>

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,739
size and I think you'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

10
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,910
this was over the next point minute so

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,849
people don't take something away from

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,218
this but like I go said I'm here to push

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,480
security from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside so what's the</font>

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,020
outside I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first</font>

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,489
question so I don't work in security

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,250
actually I only work in IT department

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,669
code but I'm out there pushing security

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,469
I do leontina software developers and

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,059
we're generating software<font color="#CCCCCC"> Uslan or</font>

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,519
business but but I'm like well like i

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,590
like most teams more comfy security is

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,479
not an afterthought it's an important

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,439
thing that we talked about every day

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,740
like today I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my</font>

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,350
experiences during my career related to

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,600
security and how to try the booster Gary

27
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,360
for non-traditional roles basically

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,429
outside of our team some of the things

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover with you this out</font>

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,650
pushing security can be both fun and

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,600
rewarding how we all believe entirety

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,110
train<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will need to try and train</font>

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,130
people to think like hackers and what is

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">responsible disclosure and if you're an</font>

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,390
information security team how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

36
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,640
create an environment to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow everyone</font>

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,500
push security footage from the inside of

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:56,280
the ELSA so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I says working for the stop</font>

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,890
we work out a stock a question and I did

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,920
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it again is securities</font>

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,500
everyone's responsibility I think

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,350
everybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably agree that's the</font>

43
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,880
truth but at your company is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

44
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,429
true

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,280
so my company's safety is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number-one</font>

46
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,370
priority but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to the point</font>

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,920
where both safety and security are

48
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,209
everybody's responsibility it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">take some work it's gonna take some</font>

50
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:27,769
works for most times if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do it</font>

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,459
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up with something</font>

52
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:34,730
like this so I picked my first walk

53
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,980
today thanks to my mentor but I'm very

54
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure even though I don't know how to big</font>

55
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,090
box very well I can bypass the security

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,160
if we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have her ready pushing</font>

57
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:48,230
security from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside this is what</font>

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,230
we do dinner so I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

59
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,798
pushing security can be reward the way I

60
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:57,230
have chosen to do that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> making sure</font>

61
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,450
there's a developer in my company who I

62
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,560
often talk about security minute ideas

63
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,810
and practices this guy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking about</font>

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,489
security they also do how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to butcher</font>

65
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,470
code so as we talked I'm in the sky

66
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,590
needed to get out from<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing software</font>

67
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,959
into America's empty so what a position

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,470
came up I encouraged to open to apply

69
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once I got him to apply I'm</font>

70
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,730
entered him on on the process and make

71
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:31,819
sure the heat was successful betty was

72
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,160
successful with<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and he got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that job</font>

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,440
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now he's an information security and</font>

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,019
he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> better they didn't assign him to</font>

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,010
the responsibility or securing the code

76
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,620
within our company so that mentoring as

77
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,209
well pet has gone away one way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to</font>

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:54,560
push it help help secure help us carry

79
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,840
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> help he still comes around we</font>

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,600
still talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and what we're</font>

81
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,520
still I'm still getting ideas on how

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,180
what you've experienced than the company

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:10,480
I thought about fun to write you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have fun at work so what's the most</font>

85
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,959
basic problem we have a security people

86
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't lock their workstations this then</font>

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a problem my whole entire</font>

88
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,860
career every company i worked at we run

89
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,890
into this problem so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do</font>

90
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,390
about well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from pushing</font>

91
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:34,570
hard to maybe not pushing so hard so Phi

92
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:37,030
the worst I've ever seen is an admin who

93
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,480
goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> office the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paki screen and</font>

94
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,400
when asked about it response was i was

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,360
only awake for a few minutes what can

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,929
someone do so here's an idea to somebody

97
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,030
what you can do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know this</font>

98
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example but you get the</font>

99
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">right street you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can replace any program</font>

100
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,070
with another<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem ego program so why</font>

101
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">not take the accessibility tools your</font>

102
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,409
list with command prompt there you gives

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,540
me something like this you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

104
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,680
get a little welcome screen with a

105
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:17,580
command prompt with lemon rice access to

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:22,060
the start menu and in the Moscow besides

107
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:26,080
captaincy this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple thing to</font>

108
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,820
do and it really it will really drive

109
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,349
the message home now you gotta be

110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,469
careful you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

111
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave because you just put a security</font>

112
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,820
hole though but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

113
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,920
demonstrate you can take up the laptop

114
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not on that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the domain</font>

115
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain what's up yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,160
a live stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you can go into</font>

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,110
the registry and replace

118
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:59,490
using the debug people shall be replaced

119
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:02,450
it with ya just cool it is they're using

120
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,530
debugger push the registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

121
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,940
that's pretty aggressive let's do

122
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,359
something a little worker look less

123
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,150
aggressive what I've ever survived this

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,160
one works really well is to go into

125
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:20,719
their monitor invert scream unlike

126
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:25,140
unlike Tom Cruise the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 most people</font>

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,610
can't work a mouse when it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bird and</font>

128
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,900
what they do get it done<font color="#E5E5E5"> done they'll</font>

129
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,290
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotter screen because they are</font>

130
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,750
working to did that a key game now we

131
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:38,850
had one person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got you so many</font>

132
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:43,470
times he actually is very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> scream as</font>

133
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,480
agree but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the truck probably</font>

134
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,000
easiest thing to do how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that company</font>

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baby's up this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stinky</font>

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,860
has prepared a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocked everybody</font>

137
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,469
should go windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> l is the quick easiest</font>

138
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,020
way to lock your here we step away super

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple super effective you find them on</font>

140
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,760
computer you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CD there you long</font>

141
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully to get the message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

142
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier I said you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my cat so let's</font>

173
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,000
I did this happy little contestant

174
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,968
surely the tester did some testing on

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,760
this password reset well turns out they

176
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> test test the case that they do a</font>

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,540

182
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,730
thing they're probably going to do is

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,810
press<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cancel button see what</font>

hit the cancel button is to get a

186
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,920
pinnacle of the cookie<font color="#E5E5E5"> English it</font>

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their test environment we verified</font>

216
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:37,050
that this truly was happening Anna and

217

<font color="#E5E5E5">scared evil and got fixed we got</font>

218
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember this one had ever happened</font>

219
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,270
someone wasn't thinking like a hacker or

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:49,410
if it were thinking my hacker and they

221
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,550
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was possible disclosure so one</font>

222
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,020
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

223
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,469
never passed an off day talk about

224
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,470
security

225
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,570
password is breaking talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when I'm</font>

226
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,760
in the United night oftentimes I phone

227
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,890
the meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> I log in with my 20-plus</font>

228
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,900
character password and the first

229
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,560
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get is why do you have such</font>

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,010
long password the password policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

231
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,750
of a bargain<font color="#CCCCCC"> mush right that gives me</font>

232
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,330
opportunity to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them about we</font>

233
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,270
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using passwords we need to</font>

234
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,740
use aspirations people are surprised

235
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,250
here windows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually put</font>

236
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,340
spaces this part of your password I also

237
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,740
tell them you know if you can at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least 2</font>

238
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:39,640
14 characters<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the 14 characters on</font>

239
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,780
little voice to land an ex-pro they

240
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,900
might not need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about the land</font>

241
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,240
and hash problem but if Tom 14 or more

242
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,770
people will do it and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they keep</font>

243
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,830
asking questions I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them about</font>

244
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:53,020
password managers obviously that has to

245
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,730
go to personal preference and policy in

246
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,840
your company the things things that you

247
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,930
can do so the other thing about

248
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,630
passwords that I did recently as I was

249
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,650
sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a public speaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> class</font>

250
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:11,650
hopefully at this point you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

251
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:14,500
you would waste money now this is mark

252
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,180
our class time it was basically learn

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,520
about Bubba I'll gave up event public

254
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,819
speaker and we did it by doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> five or</font>

255
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven talk 57 bit of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I thought</font>

256
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,520
why not talk about passwords we have all

257
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">convention on passwords surely i could</font>

258
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:35,140
get 52 to 57 minutes of material for

259
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:38,290
further comfort my talk so i gave a talk

260
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,569
three times each time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a little bit</font>

261
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,860
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it really interesting for</font>

262
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,420
the team and try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> them both</font>

263
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,150
thinking Mike hackers looking for

264
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,540
problems the last time and when they

265
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,660
create

266
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,939
no camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had in second factor</font>

267
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,060
authentication then I give the password

268
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:59,920
I said prove to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> back side you know</font>

269
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:02,400
yeah and I'll buy a bunch now luckily it

270
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,260
was this group that i was trying with

271
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,360
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anyone successful but</font>

272
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,180
I have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people try and I thought</font>

273
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a big success because I have</font>

274
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,469
been thinking like a hacker and some of

275
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,660
them you to try the social engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

276
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,770
they're all trying things that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

277
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know your turn so you might be</font>

278
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,980
thinking now I can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these things</font>

279
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,260
but surely can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something how about</font>

280
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,590
just fixing the problems you can

281
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:35,050
influence ok this is the file i<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

282
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,760
given but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wouldn't even look at one</font>

283
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,069
point my career I was never filed much

284
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,069
like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password so I saw this one</font>

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,850

daughter not this this is often the

338
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,670
response you get from developers when

339
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,579
you talked about information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

340
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,040
nope not my problem I don't want nothing

341
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,439
to do it impulse<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech is going to scan</font>

344
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:53,180
seen it what is that really the way to

345
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,640
this some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that we talk</font>

346
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">about our team is how we can secure our</font>

347
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,199
bows are coding our environment from the

348
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning so you need to think about</font>

349
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,890
things like what's the type of

350
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,750
information your story how you're going

351
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,270
to store their information what's the

352
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,709
security model is your needs there's a

353
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,750
buzzy good attorneys counter and go

baller or do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm i crack men fall</font>

356
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,530
the other thing I train my team on is

357
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:26,510
default passwords let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back</font>

358
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:31,490
passwords so i think i have gotten to

359
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,900
the point where they know this i can get

360
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,140
master hacker and your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

361
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're anything like this so if they</font>

362
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,420
put a piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment or website up</font>

363
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:46,580
whether it's in depth test or production

364
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,920
and they may default password they know

365
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to be said at this point they</font>

366
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,820
don't do anymore but there were times

367
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,909
when things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put out there I reset it</font>

368
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the damn time we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it faster I</font>

369
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,200
don't know why he just said be said

370
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:07,940
again she<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we'll talk about that</font>

371
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,160
another time so I popped a lot about

372
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,520
pushing for Allison a talk about pushing

373
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,520
too hard

374
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:21,109
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just did he get his talk was</font>

375
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:23,449
don't even push security within my

376
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,789
company I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a great idea if</font>

377
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:27,679
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would if I was up here talking about</font>

380
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,829
call from the c.i.a so because I was

381
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,349
pushing way too hard and I took the help

382
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:42,529
of my mentors and friends to talk about

383
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,178
upset issues I had with my talk and just

384
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:51,049
the things that I was revealing with the

385
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:52,429
stock so thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that but there's</font>

386
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">another good reason why we shouldn't</font>

387

would sit within his phone he's working

398

406
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:56,569
does to me think about that so we don't

407
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">want that to happen I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want that I</font>

408
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,289
was gonna go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over this talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

410
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:07,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">then look like this so for Randall this</font>

411
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:09,469
took 12 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in excess of 200</font>

412
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:14,059
thousand dollars to clear but he

413
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:15,529
eventually got a circle but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

414
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,928
remember it if you don't remember

415
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,929
anything ugly Shamar remember the story

416
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:28,700
okay most of you guys are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> full sick</font>

417
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,379
so are mine specifically talked about so

418
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,810
I'm talking about I'm talking about

419
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,840
pushing giving people I guess how to

420
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,730
push you want everybody to be a bush so

421
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,429
let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the example these guys push</font>

422
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:46,400
this boat up the beach looks like a fun

423
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:48,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to do right sure so I'm sure that</font>

424
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guys I'm primarily was pushing</font>

425
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'd have a tough time pushing this</font>

426
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,470
boat at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beach but everyone together</font>

427
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,600
his lines be success so you think back

428
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,330
to that picture than getting everybody
