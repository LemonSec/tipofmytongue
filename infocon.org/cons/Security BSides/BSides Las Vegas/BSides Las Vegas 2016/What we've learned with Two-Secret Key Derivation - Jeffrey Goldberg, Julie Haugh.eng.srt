1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,639
hey thank you and speaking of a talk at

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,879
Cambridge in December I'm just assuming

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,669
all of you have either watched that talk

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,670
or read all the slides so I don't

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have to explain what this to</font>

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,590
secret key derivation is and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:31,679
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we communicate this to</font>

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:45,149
users right yeah sure okay so um 2 of

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:47,760
the 3 j's are here yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> julie is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font>

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,180
that's me at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are being</font>

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:59,010
protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by umbrella bear a bit of an</font>

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:02,280
inside joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok anyway so two secret key</font>

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,330
derivation we've been struggling with

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:12,390
names for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing but this is the</font>

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:16,439
flavor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the week and basically what</font>

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,490
we're doing is in deriving the keys that

17
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,470
are used for both authenticating with

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,548
the 1password server now that we've

19
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:31,710
actually started running a service and

20
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:35,909
the keys that are used to that are used

21
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,419
to decrypt the key encryption key that's

22
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,400
used for encrypting your private key

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,360
from your personal key set that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,250
too many keys the so in deriving the

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,600
keys that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to unlock</font>

26
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:57,750
stuff we take to user secrets a master

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">password and something that we've called</font>

28
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:07,710
an account key and I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of why</font>

29
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:10,169
we call it that so a master password is

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,030
something that's more or less created by

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,000
the user it's stored Oh

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,850
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users head which makes it</font>

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,900
difficult to steal I mean tortures one

34
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:28,959
way but ah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it isn't you know it's</font>

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,880
created by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human created password they</font>

36
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:38,410
need to remember it they need to type it

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:42,519
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not so difficult to guess now</font>

38
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:50,380
the count key is created randomly by the

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:55,570
client 128 bits it is stored only on the

40
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:58,660
user's device is it is possible to steal

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:03,489
because it's stored on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user's on the</font>

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:07,180
user's device before they actually get

43
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:14,790
their keys for encrypting their data and

44
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:20,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much impossible to guess now</font>

45
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:25,090
the reason for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we don't</font>

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to store hashes that if stolen</font>

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,730
could be used in any kind of offline

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:36,100
attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this thing</font>

49
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,760
but we store on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server we've said</font>

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,850
until recently we never touched any user

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,120
data whatsoever and we like that and

52
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,840
there were reasons for that so we don't

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have anything worth stealing</font>

54
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,970
anything that we could work on cracking

55
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,640
if we were compelled or just decided to

56
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:03,519
turn evil here now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:06,369
happen um anyway so so by blending in

58
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,900
this other high entropy user secret this

59
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:14,680
account key then what we're storing

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,048
server-side is just basically

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,500
uncrackable now it's not actually a hash

62
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,950
it's an it's an srp verifier but the

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:30,660
principle still applies

64
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:32,219
okay now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambridge I talked</font>

65
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,100
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology the key derivation</font>

66
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,800
all of that stuff my concern here is we

67
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,060
are presenting a new kind of secret to

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,800
users and we kind of hoped that they

69
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,910
behave in ways that help their security

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,810
instead of harm their own interests now

71
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:01,560
so we've got this new kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of secret</font>

72
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:05,010
it's unfamiliar so the questions are how

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,100
do we get users to treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> it properly how</font>

74
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,030
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help users not to lose it because</font>

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,700
if they lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I if they forget their</font>

76
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,840
master password or they lose their

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:22,890
account key that's it there is no way to

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:28,770
derive those keys that are used as key

79
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:31,260
encryption keys so so now we've added a

80
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,210
new way that people can get totally

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:38,430
locked out of their data by losing their

82
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:41,760
account key so it's sort of the user is

83
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,220
the helping the user or what we attempt

84
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is really the topic of this</font>

85
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:52,610
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so chain of a psycho dog she's</font>

86
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:56,099
really sweet except for when she isn't

87
00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:00,390
catches frisbees ball we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,840
who trained her to do this but anyway so

89
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:06,300
she's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be our team leader and so</font>

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,140
what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see is a video that</font>

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:16,200
shows a first sign in and a first sign

92
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:17,909
up for one password for teams and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:25,020
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of steps</font>

94
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:31,110
here but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see or do</font>

95
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:38,060
lots of things and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's a</font>

96
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:40,650
video sorry chain of the psycho dog

97
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,090
this is Morgan the other member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

98
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:48,030
family and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah she's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sane one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

99
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,010
so although we've got to talk about team

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,900
she's going to create a family<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

101
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:57,599
the control panel and screens are a

102
00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:01,520
little simpler for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so go</font>

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:05,160
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal sign of she selects a</font>

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,010
family name and she has to give her

105
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,010
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided not to</font>

106
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,409
expose her real email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and i was</font>

107
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:19,080
too lazy to set up a special account so

108
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:22,800
there we go and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she will be given a</font>

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,090
URL based on that name and there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:36,720
she gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> told that you'll get some email</font>

111
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:38,549
there's her email real name and this by

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way is me speeding up the video</font>

113
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i typed really slowly but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chaina</font>

114
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,100
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> even slower</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay first</font>

115
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:53,729
presentation of two secrets protect your

116
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:55,470
data and now you are giving your account

117
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,229
key now the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is non</font>

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,669
secret information but the bulk of it is

119
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">secret you know so there's actually</font>

120
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">account identifier at the beginning of</font>

121
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,740
it and she called so it was

122
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:14,729
selectable you saw a copy operation she

123
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:22,200
saved it someplace ok now bow wow this

124
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:24,270
is going way too fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um but as you</font>

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,760
saw there was actually a dice we're like

126
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,880
generator to offer people<font color="#E5E5E5"> help in</font>

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,968
choosing master passwords he practices

128
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,520
that oops she typed it in wrong because

129
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:40,890
she thought it was cake instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cape</font>

130
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,770
is the last word there we go and now we

131
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:48,270
are generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> public/private key pairs</font>

132
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,760
and a bunch of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and her first</font>

133
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,150
task she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> given us to say</font>

134
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,050
how emergency kit the emergency<font color="#CCCCCC"> kit</font>

135
00:08:54,150 --> 00:09:04,439
contains all the non secret information

136
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:06,689
her account key and a nice space to

137
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,150
actually write in your master<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

138
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,670
and a QR code that will get to later

139
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're encouraged to write down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

140
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:19,140
master password put this piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paper</font>

141
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,349
in someplace safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just set up</font>

142
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:28,260
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the count oh well they're dogs</font>

143
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:30,540
you know okay um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so just so that we</font>

144
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:36,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some data to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at China enters</font>

145
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:38,699
create some data rabbits are fast and

146
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">they look as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it we</font>

147
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,820
may need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooperate instead of compete</font>

148
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,620
yay oops but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> save this to her</font>

149
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,190
personal vault this is something that

150
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be shared with every member of</font>

151
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one petrol does these</font>

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,350
different vaults with different

153
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:03,210
properties so she's now put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

154
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shared vault okay so that was a lot</font>

155
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've seen there because the this</font>

156
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:21,600
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> run-through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then also are</font>

157
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:24,420
adding data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a is a bit much but this</font>

158
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,480
means that at the moment the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

159
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,829
she has her account keys and that

160
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,550
emergency kit that we hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she</font>

161
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:38,370
saved and in the local storage of the

162
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">browser that she used for doing this and</font>

163
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the account key is absolutely</font>

164
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,180
necessary for deriving these keys so

165
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,370
what we would like her to do and for

166
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,050
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons we prefer her to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

167
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,150
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> native client instead of the web</font>

168
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,280
client because then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

169
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,780
entirely depending on TLS for the

170
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,780
overall security

171
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:11,329
ah so we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage her to</font>

172
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:13,739
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this working in one password on</font>

173
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:16,618
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client so what so the next</font>

174
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:22,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">video we're going to see her set this up</font>

175
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:24,179
in one password for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac so she's going</font>

176
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to preferences she's going to</font>

177
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,799
select add a new team she's first going

178
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it the hard way she's going to</font>

179
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,299
give up on doing it the hard way she's

180
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:36,600
going to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the easy way and then</font>

181
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:45,029
we'll see that she has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vols from her</font>

182
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:51,869
team so so she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> joining a team using</font>

183
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:54,329
one password for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac she can enter it</font>

184
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:57,569
manually which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the which</font>

185
00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:01,319
means the account key the email address

186
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:05,579
the you are URL and the master password

187
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:10,079
that's not anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> any human or</font>

188
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:12,959
canine should ever have to type so we've

189
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,719
got this scanning a QR code here's a

190
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,638
handy copy from her emergency kit and

191
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,899
boom everything is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> except the</font>

192
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,839
master password which she types in and

193
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:34,169
now this instance of one password for

194
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:38,100
Mac on this machine has that team data

195
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:43,319
and we see within one password her

196
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,929
secure note about strategy so now this

197
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:49,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored again it's unencrypted but</font>

198
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:55,220
it's stored by the emojis<font color="#E5E5E5"> but out the</font>

199
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:59,879
count key is now stored by the client

200
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:02,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we do need to add more people have</font>

201
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:07,589
more dogs to this family we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

202
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:12,498
add morgan and that is going to look

203
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,499
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

204
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:18,240
so first chain is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

205
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,359
we're switching back and forth between

206
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,910
China and Morgan you get one of the dogs

207
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,550
shelling who's actually the one doing

208
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:35,279
stuff now<font color="#E5E5E5"> or for China uses chrome</font>

209
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:45,359
Morgan uses safari so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Serena sends an</font>

210
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:48,920
invite and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she gets a list of family</font>

211
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:56,069
members including those pending invites

212
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:58,740
and Morgan gets email rabbit hunters is

213
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:02,250
using one password<font color="#CCCCCC"> chaina the psycho dog</font>

214
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,449
wants you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join rabbit hunters she</font>

215
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:09,720
clicked the link she's got she's now

216
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:17,029
given this sign up stuff introduced it

217
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:19,800
to the two keys I didn't see her select

218
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:23,779
that account key even though she pressed

219
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:27,029
I've got it safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and she types in</font>

220
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:30,329
she creates a master password and i'll

221
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:36,449
write the which was a wonderful master

222
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:42,649
password of ABC 123 ABC oh look save

223
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:42,649
your emergency kit remind<font color="#CCCCCC"> me later hmm</font>

224
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now there's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of back</font>

225
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:55,949
and forth because because Morgan's keys

226
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,489
are generated by Morgan's client when

227
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:04,680
she first signs up for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public key to</font>

228
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:07,110
get to the team administrator anyway

229
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">China has to go through this step for</font>

230
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user it's just it's just confirming</font>

231
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:19,290
what it actually is doing is it is

232
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:24,600
encrypting the vault key for the shared

233
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:28,980
key with China's public key anyway now

234
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,889
Dana Morgan I'm sorry Morgan can enter

235
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:46,380
in some very precious data that must

236
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:47,910
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever be lost and as you see she</font>

237
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">could actually get what's in the shared</font>

238
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:55,560
vault as well because the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

239
00:15:53,220 --> 00:16:15,750
vault has been encrypted with her public

240
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:18,479
key and and there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now we</font>

241
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,699
were really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> scared would we</font>

242
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,589
thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this notion of account key we</font>

243
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,060
just thought it's way too easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

244
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:31,439
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get themselves locked out but</font>

245
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:35,579
we a jalebi do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

246
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">power or responsibility of doing actual</font>

247
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,500
recovery for people who have lost their

248
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,449
account keys or forgot my master

249
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,610
passwords we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the power</font>

250
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we shouldn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be sitting</font>

251
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">there trying to decide whether some</font>

252
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:55,350
request is genuine from the real owner

253
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:58,110
so what we've done instead is we have

254
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:04,319
given the family organizers or team

255
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:09,569
owners that power so every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vault</font>

256
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:15,510
is created by any user within a team or

257
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:18,629
within a family the the keys to that

258
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:23,189
particular vault get encrypted with the

259
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,589
public keys of the organizer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

260
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:28,350
organizer may not actually have access

261
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,039
to the actual encrypted data that's done

262
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:35,549
through normal kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of access control</font>

263
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:37,710
sorts of stuff from our server so they

264
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,100
don't have access to the data but they

265
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,570
do

266
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:47,189
the keys for it so China<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has</font>

267
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:51,230
the keys to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Morgan's personal vault but</font>

268
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">China does not have the authority to get</font>

00:17:51,230 --> 00:18:05,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Act the encrypted data that is</font>

270
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:11,940
China's personal vault<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so he would</font>

271
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:13,918
go with recovery Morgan having trashed

272
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,140
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Safari installation has lost her</font>

273
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,299
account key and thus lost her access to

274
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the secret plans in an act of</font>

00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:24,059
desperation she<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends an out-of-band</font>

blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah ok so now so Jane</font>

280
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,960
has gotten this out of band message

281
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:43,799
which obviously I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing she goes</font>

282
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:47,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the admin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> council console and she</font>

sees<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan here</font>

284
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:57,029
and she clicks on a begin recovery

285
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,929
button and that really just sets

286
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">Morgan's account into a particular state</font>

287
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:12,090
and send email to Morgan about the road

288
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:15,359
to recovery and effectively Morgan is

289
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,230
creating a new account but it's with her

290
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,879
old email address and identifying

291
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:31,489
informations she gets a new account key

292
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:38,428
and look she saved at this time and she

293
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:41,639
chooses a master password and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now a</font>

294
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:44,909
new public key pair has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated</font>

295
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:51,320
and created for<font color="#E5E5E5"> her but you still can't</font>

296
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:55,369
get in until the team owner confirms our

297
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,289
recovery or completes the recovery and

298
00:19:55,369 --> 00:20:02,279
this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the completing the</font>

299
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:06,090
recovery in which the new owner sends

300
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:09,119
the appropriate vault keys or encrypts

301
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:17,070
the appropriate vault keys with Morgan's

302
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:19,199
new public key and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now back in she</font>

303
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:24,090
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> tips to not have to go through</font>

304
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:29,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">this again save your emergency kit write</font>

305
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:32,418
down your master password join<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

306
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,419
and new clients

307
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,750
you know now so one of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

308
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,169
these emergency kits and these account

309
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,419
keys is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the users</font>

310
00:20:49,169 --> 00:21:03,100
responsibility to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the count key from</font>

311
00:20:52,419 --> 00:21:05,650
client to client<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but I'm it's not</font>

312
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:10,000
handled by us it's what the QR code is

313
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:15,190
for so they can either manually type it

314
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:22,150
in and so here you'll see her setting it

315
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:31,900
up in within<font color="#E5E5E5"> one password on an iphone</font>

316
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:35,100
at a count scan QR code and here when

317
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:39,909
you actually logged in on the web the

318
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,189
forget the apps link includes the QR

319
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:45,280
code it really scans fast i did not

320
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,460
speed that one up everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

321
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">master password is filled in here she</font>

322
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:56,980
types in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant master password and</font>

323
00:21:51,340 --> 00:22:00,580
the server is unreachable because all

324
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,250
this demo construction was done on b5

325
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">local comm instead of actually our real</font>

326
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:10,950
server so it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> local host on that</font>

327
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:15,399
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's time for a nap</font>

328
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:17,919
and now all right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show the QR</font>

329
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:23,740
code scanning a little slower<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm</font>

330
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:30,370
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an expert on iMovie in case</font>

331
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:36,400
you didn't notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the questions</font>

332
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:38,320
that we have is will<font color="#CCCCCC"> our users</font>

333
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,880
understand that the count key is a

334
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,840
secret you know they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

335
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,260
reading everything on those pages will

336
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,820
they understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is their secret</font>

337
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,610
so remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're given a license</font>

338
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,139
code for example when you're given a

339
00:22:54,610 --> 00:23:00,559
license code

340
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:04,280
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a secret that matters to</font>

341
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,730
the software vendor it doesn't hurt you

342
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:11,690
if that secret if a license code you're

343
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,970
given by the vendor leaks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

344
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,470
secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they need to protect for</font>

345
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:22,220
their interests and is there more that

346
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:25,220
we can do to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk of</font>

347
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:32,210
catastrophic data loss now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

348
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:35,000
actually counted but so far we're

349
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,730
actually doing pretty well from what we

350
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,100
get into customer customer support the

351
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who are losing account keys or</font>

352
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,620
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just testing things out</font>

353
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:50,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free system who don't actually</font>

354
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:54,020
have who don't who actually haven't put

355
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:59,149
data into the system so the overwhelming

356
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:05,049
majority of I'm locked out help me and

357
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:11,660
we have to say tough have been harmless

358
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:14,389
so far we also find that almost all of

359
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:18,020
them are from people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have only used</font>

360
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,700
the web client so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are I mean</font>

361
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,850
there are other reasons as well but

362
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:28,280
we're really trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to push people to</font>

363
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:30,559
use the native apps but we see this new

364
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,340
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of secret that we're asking people</font>

365
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,280
to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with as quite possibly the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

366
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,090
as at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most difficult</font>

367
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or challenges that we face as</font>

368
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:46,070
we've rolled out this one password

369
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:54,799
service as opposed to just the local

370
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:57,379
apps and you know we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

371
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,460
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it easier for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

372
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,190
behave securely you know and so usable

373
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,820
security is central to what we do

374
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,419
throughout but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> face tough questions</font>

375
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,749
with

376
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:24,230
so and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to leave</font>

377
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:28,789
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff is an expert at asking questions</font>

378
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:30,109
at passwords come so now I'm hoping

379
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,009
there are people in the audience who are

380
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:33,009
questions for Jeff

381
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,500
jeffer would it work if you have a

382
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,080
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> with 20 or hundred thousand</font>

383
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and that many accounts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would this</font>

384
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,379
work with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

385
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,750
experience do you know how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

386
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna get I mean it certainly works with</font>

387
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:04,230
20 it works with hundreds are you

388
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,180
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a customer new customer</font>

389
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:10,290
with a hundred thousand users that's the

390
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,260
question um it's a pretty big license

391
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:20,070
yeah yeah no no no we'd we'd guess yes

392
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll work just the day his disapproving</font>

393
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Justin he really is improving not what</font>

394
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:29,959
are the sales people you know I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

395
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,960
light of course is we're all in sales

396
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:44,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay so um I don't know what the</font>

397
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:49,740
largest company we have is but but

398
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:55,260
thousands we know works and it should

399
00:26:49,740 --> 00:27:05,640
scale very nicely so it's built to do

400
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:10,010
that hey em I was going to ask if you

401
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,720
had any feedback from users who are

402
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:15,360
surprised that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're under this</font>

403
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,110
hierarchy so you have a hierarchy of a

404
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,570
team owner and then these users who can

405
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:26,879
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> bean be overridden by</font>

406
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:32,659
whoever's above them yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

407
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:36,030
actually said so we haven't actually had

408
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:39,590
reports from users from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:44,310
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> non team owners and managers</font>

410
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:47,790
saying wait I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my team</font>

411
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:50,700
owner had all this power but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

412
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,460
because we haven't had that yet doesn't

413
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,110
mean it isn't

414
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,530
something that we that were worrying

415
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:59,750
about it did I don't know if I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

416
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:06,379
negatives in there it's this is a

417
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:13,070
question that bothers us so is it clear

418
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:18,740
to Morgan that<font color="#E5E5E5"> China has these powers</font>

419
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:22,879
now cryptographically chain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team</font>

420
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:28,580
owner has everything but we also have

421
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:33,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">access control mechanisms so that Shana</font>

422
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the data is not</font>

423
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:42,380
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data to decrypt from</font>

424
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:44,450
Morgan's vault obviously we prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

425
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,150
have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these assurances done</font>

426
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,600
completely cryptographically instead of

427
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:54,980
having to rely on authentication and

428
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:59,719
access control but we do have that but

429
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:04,370
in principle it would be possible for

China to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say get the cached data</font>

431
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:10,250
off of Morgan's computer Shana would

432
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:13,430
have to be digging into because of

433
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,920
course the keys that<font color="#E5E5E5"> China has access to</font>

434
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,530
aren't actually exposed to her in the UI

435
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,190
he'd have to do some digging to get them

436
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:27,980
her client has them that is a line of

437
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack but there is some confusion one</font>

438
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,600
of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I may go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

439
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:36,410
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this one of the problems</font>

440
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:40,939
we face<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when somebody leaves a</font>

441
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:45,940
company is their personal vault there's

442
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:51,410
or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company's and each</font>

443
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:57,220
organization has a different view and so

444
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:57,220
we are actually working on trying to

445
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,470
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on trying to have a way so</font>

446
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,420
that if an organization says the stuff

447
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,240
in the personal vault is the

448
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:11,720
personal thing that that data can be

449
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,990
transferred to a personal account for

450
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,320
somebody who is leaving a team but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

451
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:21,710
is a work in progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yes these are</font>

452
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult issues our view was to try to</font>

453
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:26,240
leave it up to the organization's but we

454
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,460
really can't we have to enable the

455
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations to do what makes sense for</font>

456
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,860
them yeah I have a question I wanna make

457
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,440
sure I understand how you're generating

458
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,060
the KEK are you actually using the the

459
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,350
account key plus a master keen like a

460
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret sharing scheme or something to</font>

461
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,980
get that or are you rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the</font>

462
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,139
account key initially to authenticate

463
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,210
and like pinning that somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a</font>

464
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,210
secret sharing would be really cool and

465
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:54,470
that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original goal but mostly</font>

466
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:58,400
it's just we both are used in deriving

467
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:02,240
it it's not actually secret sharing with

468
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:06,410
it's an it's the details of the KDF or

469
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,770
in the white paper it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

470
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:12,290
messy because we left a hole for where

471
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,720
we wanted secret sharing to go in so

472
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some key derivation stuff</font>

473
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,040
on both<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually get X sword and</font>

474
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:24,830
then some stuff after that so so yes it

475
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,230
really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secret key derivation not</font>

476
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:31,909
one key for one thing in another key for

477
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay whoever has the</font>

478
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,550
microphone photographers is there a way

479
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,090
to have more than one team owner or can

480
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:44,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want an a-team be an owner yes and</font>

481
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:50,330
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we encourage is</font>

482
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:53,030
that is specifically this is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

483
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,000
more than one team owner you've got more

484
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">than one person who's capable of doing</font>

485
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,170
recoveries if let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a team owner</font>

486
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,180
gets you know hit by boss or loses their

487
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,120
account key or forgets their master

488
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,420
password so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually four teams</font>

489
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:17,000
it's another one of these quests we try

490
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,260
to say set up another owner organizer in

491
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,100
our

492
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:25,700
beta we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had a more complicated</font>

493
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:29,719
set of roles so we had what was called

494
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:32,360
the recovery group but we just merged

495
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,080
that with owner and organizer because it

496
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,020
was confusing people but underlying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

497
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,659
we actually have the ability to specify

498
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:45,770
a recovery group which is a group of

499
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,540
individuals who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are who who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones</font>

500
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:51,230
who are getting these vault keys and

501
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:54,470
have the power to initiate recovery so

502
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:59,240
there's more granularity under the hood

503
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:02,360
than is actually exposed to the users so

504
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,700
when you sign a new team member is that

505
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,229
all done excuse me is that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on</font>

506
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:15,470
the client computer of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team owner so</font>

507
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:21,920
the invitation the invitation for a new

508
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:28,940
team member is is constructed by the

509
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:32,180
client of the team owner the email the

510
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:36,740
email notification<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes through us but</font>

511
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:43,310
the invit but the invitation URL is that

512
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:45,560
is constructed by the client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

513
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,460
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not actually answering your</font>

514
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,460
actual question

515
00:33:53,260 --> 00:34:03,310
oh sorry so once you confirm somebody

516
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:05,590
who's joined in right so once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've can</font>

517
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:09,580
so when an owner confirm somebody who

518
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:18,009
joins in what they are doing on their

519
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:20,980
client is is encrypting let's say the

520
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:33,360
shared vault key to the public key of

521
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:39,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new member repeat the question oh</font>

522
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:41,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so then the follow-up is is have we</font>

523
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,320
considered open sourcing that code so

524
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:47,070
that people can actually see that this

525
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:52,350
really is happening client-side

526
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:52,350
considered it yes we haven't done it yet

527
00:34:53,190 --> 00:35:01,720
I'm sure we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all these normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

528
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">user License things that say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh reverse</font>

529
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:13,290
engineering is bad just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know first</font>

530
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:15,910
engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it check it out okay haha so</font>

531
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,620
Jennifer Jeff of course is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>
