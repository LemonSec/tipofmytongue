standing up here talking and bringing

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,450
other folks on stage to go through some

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,239
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things they care about they've</font>

hopes dreams today we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:01,590
lot more collaborative so yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,599
to recap we started out and just did an

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,049
overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm the cavalry so if you're</font>

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,100
not familiar with I'm the cavalry we're

22
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,010
grassroots initiative that started three

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,979
years ago here on august first so we're

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,799
we're two days past our<font color="#CCCCCC"> third birthday</font>

25
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was that as we looked</font>

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,509
around the infosec community we saw a

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,780
lot of the types of failures that we

28
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,729
typically have servers crashing laptops

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,900
not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up when they're supposed to</font>

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,090
such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAV fail over here mobile phones</font>

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,030
getting malware on them all of these

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,009
types of things we really hadn't seen a

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,409
consequential failure we hadn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

34
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,270
loss of life we hadn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a massive</font>

35
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,939
scale where people start started to

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,390
distrust the technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> underlined</font>

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,779
some of these societal systems but as

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,320
we're connecting software to more and

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things around us the</font>

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,548
consequences of those failures will

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,810
increase so it won't be as much about

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,880
credit card data PII and it will be a

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,520
lot more about loss of life loss of

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,679
trust and as we started looking around

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,349
and talking to government people

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,920
corporate folks others who might be

47
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,190
looking

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,170
at these types of problems spaces so

49
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,900
that we could fix them we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

50
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,179
there really weren't there wasn't

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,250
anybody in charge right we got as as

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,630
high in deep as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could and found that</font>

53
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the adults in the room and that</font>

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,940
scared the hell out of us and made us

55
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,840
empowered to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take action and</font>

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to decide our own faith so that's</font>

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,510
how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name came about we said if the</font>

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,329
cavalry isn't coming then the

59
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,819
responsibility falls to us and so I am

60
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,340
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cavalry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is all of us saying I will</font>

61
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,339
be part of the solution I will not go

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,900
quietly into back into that night so

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,880
that was our introduction yesterday just

64
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,340
basically briefing the people who

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,000
haven't yet heard about us then we

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,739
started talking about hacker heroes we

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,480
had Karen Ella's already do a great talk

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,630
if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it yesterday</font>

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,660
it's recorded and it'll be posted two or

70
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,090
three weeks kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calling out all the</font>

71
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,400
protectors in the crowd the people who

72
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to solve hard problems because they</font>

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,700
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a global good we had a</font>

74
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,989
panel where we tried to talk through

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,670
some of the hard problems that we see

76
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,060
every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as the things that</font>

solutions might be so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can solve</font>

85
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,280
them and move towards something better

86

better because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this community like</font>

105
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,730
sticking their hand up and saying wait a

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,000
the industry some trends looking back

114

three to five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,540
today what's happening and then

116
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,760
projecting out another year or so and

<font color="#E5E5E5">five minute lightning talks from</font>

120
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,099
different perspectives we had a u.s.

regulator the US FDA Suzanne Schwartz

122

bringing in security researchers as a

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:44,200
part of a healthy ecosystem and how

129
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,390
important we are to them we had Colin

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,530
Morgan from Johnson & Johnson give a

131

135
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,030

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,390
from Johnson & Johnson's perspective and

141
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,880

Radcliffe a security researcher talking

147
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,320
about the maturity of the entire

148
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,270
ecosystem and some of the baby steps

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,529
that he's seen in the past five years

150
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,438
where we've come

151
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,999
and how not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the company's</font>

152
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,539
matured and gotten better about

153
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:46,119
responding to us also the FDA and

154
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,589
ics-cert and other government agencies

155
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,929
have got better gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> better about</font>

156
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:52,239
dealing with security research security

157
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:55,179
researchers but the researchers

158
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:57,188
themselves have also stepped up and

159
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,899
they've been more willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

160
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,059
collaboratively rather than just

161
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,919
dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> o day at black hat and it's not</font>

162
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:05,439
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> any one group stood up it's</font>

163
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,779
because all of them collectively started

164
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,439
stand standing up and going around<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

165
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:13,569
virtuous circle then we had quatie who

166
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,479
is here give a talk from a physician's

167
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,159
perspective and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said look</font>

168
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,748
guys this isn't about you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

169
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about manufacturers it's not about the</font>

170
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:24,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">FDA it's about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patients patient</font>

171
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:27,789
safety is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one concern and</font>

172
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:29,378
then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that talk we had a car talk</font>

173
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,389
which I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did run</font>

174
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,399
upstairs so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you debrief on</font>

175
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,519
that yeah we we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the most progress</font>

176
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,689
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in automotive and medical so</font>

177
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,509
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really highlighted them</font>

178
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,979
yesterday so I basically showed the

179
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:43,539
five-star cyber safety framework we

180
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,099
published two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and then gave</font>

181
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,318
kind of a progress report for how many

182
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">in which parts the automotive ecosystem</font>

183
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,669
have embraced it so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing a</font>

184
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:53,318
highly technical presentation if you

185
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,179
want to go look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this I showed the</font>

186
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,699
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides that are appropriate for</font>

187
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:59,589
being ambassadors into that community we

188
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,169
also we glossed over who was on the

189
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,719
midday panel with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nickerson but that was</font>

190
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:09,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the head of cyber security for</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of show these are areas that are</font>

working why they're working and where

199

the passion plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal responsibility</font>

200
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,209
and ownership had really made a dent so

201
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:36,009
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those examples came up again in</font>

202
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,318
the car car place because we were able

203
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:40,149
to show where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nitsa was essentially</font>

good reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now how you have Tesla</font>

vulnerably disclosure programs with a

few others coming soon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

213
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,240
really a progress report of what's

214
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:07,279
succeeded to date against the five-star

215

cyber safety framework and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> overall</font>

216
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,019
ecosystem and then we adjourned abruptly

217
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:19,009
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bose overview yesterday is not bad I</font>

218
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,439
see some new faces so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> little framing things the purpose</font>

of today is if yesterday emotionally was

221
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:29,779
where we've won and where we're winning

222

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years today is really</font>

223
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard problems that we don't</font>

224
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to fix really hard ones and we</font>

225
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,899
want to have the candor and the trust

226
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:43,069
with each of you to speak very

227
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:44,180
aggressively about some of these in the

228
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,889
morning when I really tackle

229
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,229
uncomfortable truths and one of things

230
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,310
we've experienced is this is a great

231
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,230
line I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from one of the</font>

232
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,000
presidents but the opposite of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

233
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,209
profound truth is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a profound lie</font>

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,009
it's the it's another profound truth and

235
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,609
most of our hard intractable problems or

236
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:04,279
where you have competing profound truths

237
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,350
that come into tension and we can't be

238
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,639
so polarizing as to say well my truth is

239
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,740
more important than your truth because

240
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,089
that perpetuates a stalemate so one of

241
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,920
the things you want to do is surface

242
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:15,170
some profound truths that make this

243
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard in fact one of these</font>

244
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,610
I alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cyber safety</font>

245
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:21,589
framework for<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto is start number three</font>

246
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,809
which I'll show up briefly in a minute

247
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,550
is evidence capture we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

248
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:28,160
security log in your evidence capture

249
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,750
and automobiles at all and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

250
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,779
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't is actually friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

251
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,519
ours that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our privacy advocates have</font>

252
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,079
been so harsh on the automotive industry

253
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,930
historically and on the government

254
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,219
historically for good reasons that none

255
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,079
of them are willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get then that</font>

256
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,970
fight again so there's really

257
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,800
intractable problem we're really good

258
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,680
privacy goals are coming in detention

259
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,859
with really important forensic and NTSB

260
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,899
and accident investigation goals so

261
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,029
rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> us admiring the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

262
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,370
being stuck for years the goal of the

263
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,600
cavalry<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be safer sooner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'd</font>

264
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,029
only do that if we work together and

265
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,870
that means we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear some</font>

266
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,910
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these so I</font>

267
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,200
have some horror stories i'm going to

268
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,189
share from the Health and Human Services

269
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity task force of how</font>

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,440
dangerous modern healthcare labor

271
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,210
organizations are and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,490
to solve some of those problems we're

273
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,080
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to surface some on agricultural</font>

274
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,630
technology which threatens parts of the

275
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,940
global food supply we hope to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

276
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the oil</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and gas issues if people</font>

277
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,510
are willing and we're also going to shut

278
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,819
the cameras off so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know at the moment someone wants to</font>

280
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can have really important</font>

281
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,140
revelation and servicing a ground truth

282
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,160
and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is later this afternoon</font>

283
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,230
we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those ground truth</font>

284
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,439
and if we have uncomfortable truths they

285
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:50,510
assess it a ton comfortable solutions so

286
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,600
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we kind of hate regulation</font>

287
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:58,100
we kind of hate laws and we kind of hate

288
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,839
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of society when</font>

289
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,430
we have you know cars that can kill

290
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">people or airlines that can fall out of</font>

291
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,150
the sky or oil and gas pipelines that

292
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,850
can explode we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandatory safety</font>

293
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,920
things and now that bits and bytes or

294
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,920
meeting flesh and blood even if it's

295
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,990
uncomfortable we want to surface maybe

296
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,189
some possible solutions to rise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font>

297
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,640
challenges so with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

298
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,709
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show a few framing things</font>

299
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,870
especially cuz there's some new faces

300
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then i'd like to get into some</font>

301
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,170
uncomfortable truths if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

302
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,900
if you have one we want to hear it so

303
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,969
I'm terrified right now by clinical

304
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,740
medical environments agricultural

305
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,930
technology and some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil and gas</font>

306
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,209
stuff but maybe you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an even worse</font>

307
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,349
one that we haven't heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yet so this</font>

308
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where we want to surface some of that</font>

309
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,820
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else</font>
