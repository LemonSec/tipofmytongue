day job involves me running a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

23
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,539
malware in a lab in which I not only

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,420
record the behavior of the malware but

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,580
I'm also recording the the network

26
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,900
traffic of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware communicating</font>

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,570
with its command and control servers

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,310
downloading payloads and to do that we

29
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a bunch of appliances that the</font>

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,050
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes and i just used those</font>

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:57,740
products in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my research but I'm also a</font>

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,740
gamer and I found as I got a little

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,320
older that playing twitch games on us on

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,479
a screen actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to give me</font>

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,759
migraines and make me feel sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,440
was a really depressing experience until

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,720
I discovered augmented reality gaming

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,579
and so I I got into this game called

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:22,190
ingress in a pretty big way is this

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work right so in this talk I'm</font>

41
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,280
going to talk a little bit about the

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,230
fundamentals of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game itself but I'm</font>

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
also going to talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use some</font>

44
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,720
of the tools in my lab to decrypt and

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,310
decode some of the communications in the

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,250
game just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn a little bit more</font>

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game worked now a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,360
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that niantic the company that</font>

49
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,370
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> pokemon go is the same company</font>

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,130
that makes ingress and egress in a lot

51
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways is both a precursor of an a</font>

52
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,790
supporter of the Pokemon universe so

53
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,090
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cross-pollination</font>

54
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,650
involved in both games and it what I see

55
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,570
here as being a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,940
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them have been</font>

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,579
addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic in Pokemon go but a</font>

58
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,790
lot of them persist especially those

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,200
involving personal safety privacy and

60
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,850
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about all of those</font>

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,070
things but we're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

62
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,600
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine Tech has done and and</font>

63
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,489
what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do because this is the</font>

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,250
breaking ground track and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

65
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,810
that this be a very interactive back and

66
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,430
forth is I'm hoping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience</font>

67
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,200
will come forth with suggestions I know

68
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,750
there's a number of ingress players who

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,980
are here in the room as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

70
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,230
people are interested in privacy and

71
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,970
security so I'm hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

72
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,079
good suggestions at the end I have a lot

73
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,190
of slides to get through so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,170
going to whip through it as quickly as

75
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible</font>

76
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so so what is ingress so ingress</font>

77
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,680
is this very interesting science fiction

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">theme game with a very paranoid back</font>

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,530
story involving aliens making a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,630
covert intrusion into this world from

81
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,240
another dimension and as they're doing

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,799
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of their technology is</font>

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,060
leaking into this dimension and only

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,670
people with special things called

85
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,700
scanners ie the ingress app are able to

86
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,519
see this technology for what it is think

87
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,619
of it as as they live for like the year

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,120
2016 you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these goggles where you</font>

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,310
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,020
there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal people can't see you</font>

91
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">can interact with these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things and you</font>

92
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,459
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to advance within the game</font>

93
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,160
attack other teams and just have a lot

94
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,590
of fun out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world everything</font>

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happens in the game takes place in</font>

96
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,000
or around these things called portals

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,160
portals are basically user-submitted

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,260
physical locations in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world</font>

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,270
they have to be human created things

100
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,419
with some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of artistic or creative</font>

101
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,490
or cultural social value that users have

102
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,460
submitted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic and niantic has had</font>

103
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,200
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human basically approve these as being</font>

104
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,690
locations that can be portals and

105
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,419
everything happens with these portals

106
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:48,200
the only way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can interact with</font>

107
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:51,049
portals is to be standing 40 meters or

108
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,909
less from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> portal itself so a lot of</font>

109
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,860
the interaction within the game at least

110
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,630
the legitimate interaction that's done

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,669
by players who aren't cheating and doing

112
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,040
other kinds of goofy stuff is to be

113
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">walking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around in the world going to</font>

114
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">these portals and interacting with them</font>

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,140
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not always the case so the</font>

116
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,270
correlation between<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon go and</font>

117
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,229
ingress is really really obvious to

118
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,960
people who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been playing ingress</font>

119
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,229
even for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little while these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,020
two screenshots of on the left side are

121
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,330
the the screen for a portal and on the

122
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,690
right side or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen for a pokey</font>

123
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,520
stop or a gym and basically in smaller

124
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,860
towns where there aren't a lot of places

125
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,900
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play these things it is a pretty much</font>

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,190
a one-to-one correlation but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

127
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,950
like Las Vegas where there are

128
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,080
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> tons of portals crowding the</font>

129
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,870
entire city what you see is that there's

130
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,430
sort of a one out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every three or one</font>

131
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,249
out of every four portals has been

132
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,049
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

133
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:50,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pokemon go and is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a pokey stopper</font>

134
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jim just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the density is too high</font>

135
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,769
so the other thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of key</font>

136
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:57,209
to understand in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the background</font>

137
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,429
is just sort of how the how you play the

138
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:02,159
game a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit everything you do in</font>

139
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:03,899
the game involves you using this stuff

140
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,369
called exotic matter this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the stuff</font>

141
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,799
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> science-fiction universe that</font>

142
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:10,709
is leaking into our universe essentially

143
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:12,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">its energy that you get by walking</font>

144
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,009
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world and it's in the game</font>

145
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,899
it's represented as these little like

146
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,179
floating blobs that as you walk along

147
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:21,299
they kind of get sucked into your

148
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:22,589
players avatar in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game and when you</font>

149
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,589
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of this energy you can do</font>

151
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,119
it that's kind of cool and appeals to me

152
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,949
as a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is that your primary</font>

153
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,959
way of interacting with these portals is

154
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,819
to hack them it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a</font>

155
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,009
button that says hack in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game and</font>

156
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,199
that that hacking the portals is the

157
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,349
primary way in which you gather gear and

158
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,599
collect keys and do other things that

159
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">involve gathering resources to do stuff</font>

160
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,009
with in the game now there's two scoring

161
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,079
methods there's a personal scoring

162
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,059
method for each individual player where

163
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,889
they get points based on how far they

164
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,139
walk how many portals they hack how many

165
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,299
unique portals they hack or capture the

166
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,219
length of links between them the fields

167
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:04,589
the size of fields that they make out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

168
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,629
linking triangles of these portals

169
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,789
together are all contribute to an

170
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,579
individual score but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there is a</font>

171
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,619
separate scoring two factions or teams

172
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,339
within the game that is purely based on

173
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:23,129
the area that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is captured on the planet</font>

different teams have captured these

00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:51,449
colored areas are called fields and but

186
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,849
if you zoom in the closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to any</font>

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,169
that you know such as like right here at

189
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,909
the Tuscany

190
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,068
there are six portals within reach and I

191
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:04,020
took the screenshot about an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour ago</font>

192
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,490
but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> killed this green portal</font>

193
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,799
that's here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and turned</font>

194
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,090
turned it<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey so so if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

195
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,740
in here and you won't you want to

196
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture a free portal like just you know</font>

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,319
drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple resonators on it right now</font>

198
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,779
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exactly so if you didn't</font>

199
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,520
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually wearing the key of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the resistance faction that's the</font>

202
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,469
elements that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to just sort of</font>

203
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:30,240
mention in passing just because it's

204
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:33,208
such a rich game and there's so many

205
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can play it there's a</font>

00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">puzzle game within the game that called</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">living where you instead of hacking you</font>

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the hack button for a long</font>

209
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,190
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of draw little</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">patterns on the screen it's it's a</font>

211
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,370
little bit of like a memorization<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

212
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,480
because it does these little symbols

213
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,399
called the playoffs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

214
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,310
repeat them and you get more gear if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,779
do them accurately and fast again

216
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,219
there's these badges that you can get

217
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,589
for different accomplishments within the

218
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,990
game that's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> two Hmong players</font>

219
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,329
and then every once in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while players</font>

220
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,399
will get together in cities in events

221
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:08,130
organized by<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic called an anomaly</font>

222
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,839
for example the nearest next one is

223
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in two weeks in Denver and</font>

224
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,790
what happens in those places is the the

225
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,839
company sets out certain portals as

226
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,939
being critical capture points for one

227
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,740
faction or the other to either hold or

228
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,949
to take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other faction and</font>

229
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,470
the the winners<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these anomalies</font>

230
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:30,959
actually decide key decision points

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,089
within the fictional story line of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

233
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">or another so the anomalies are actually</font>

234
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,859
pretty key to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing</font>

backstory that happens within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

236
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just as another thing people</font>

237
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,339
who are at this event especially will

238
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,110
really appreciate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that there</font>

239
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">are these things called pass codes which</font>

240
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,029
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten character codes that when you</font>

241
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:57,300
enter them into your scanner app on your

242
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:59,010
phone will give you extra gear and one

243
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,689
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that people discover these</font>

244
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,910
pass codes well some of them are leaked

245
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,310
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic and some of them are handed</font>

246
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,899
around by teams to their friends but

247
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,719
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very interesting is</font>

248
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,610
that the company puts out these<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos</font>

249
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,250
and screenshots and other interesting

250
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,769
art on their website and on their

251
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,140
Google+ page and if you search through

252
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,230
these images often in the metadata or

253
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,779
sometimes just buried<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the image</font>

254
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,310
almost as a steganographic exercise they

255
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,050
will put these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass codes in there and</font>

256
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,449
there are teams of people who just do

257
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,729
steganography and image analysis to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

258
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,700
these things it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of a cool</font>

259
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,459
side game there's just some screens from

260
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,560
the game showing for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Guardian badge which is one of the the</font>

262
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,099
rarest and most difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> gadgets to</font>

263
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,779
obtain because it involves maintaining

control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a portal that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you captured</font>

for a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of days and the</font>

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">highest level badge is 150</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it is by</font>

267
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,110
far the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardest badge in the game to get</font>

268
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,890
and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nature of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

270
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,870
bit about the communications within

271
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,910
ingress so there are basically there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

272
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,769
this mechanism in ingress to send

273
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,319
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth between players</font>

274
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,649
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the game itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will send</font>

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,959
game messages involving say like when

276
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,399
someone person attacks an apple that's

277
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,709
controlled by<font color="#CCCCCC"> another person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

278
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,810
other faction that person will receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

279
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,209
little alert message in their scanner

280
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,540
app that says so-and-so is attacking

281
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:29,518
this portal at dislocation and all of

282
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,839
this stuff is basically broadcast to

283
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,529
everybody who's within a certain

284
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">geographic radius of the location where</font>

to each other or mostly actions that

310
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,240
is really fairly rudimentary and it

311
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,430
doesn't require all the gear that I have

312

339
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,470
when you're running SSL decryption in an

<font color="#CCCCCC">Android device and you have to add the</font>

344
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,040
just thought i'd show these because it's

345
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,930
worth noting that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't just do this</font>

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,969
SSL decryption without the person who's

347
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,500
being monitored knowing about it first

348
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,390
of all you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manually install</font>

349
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,070
these certs which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an non trivial</font>

351
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:03,450
install them and it secondly it then

352
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,030
pops up these warning messages pretty

353
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,710
persistently almost all the time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,270

the notification it pops up this bigger

356

communication the cipher suite that was

the recent certificate decryption and

373
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,400
most of them it says success but on the

374
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,680
the second and last one it says alert

375
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,660
bad record<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac and that just means that</font>

376
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,239
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mismatch in the mac address</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular that particular</font>

up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first thing it does because and</font>

once you've gone through the

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,209
authentication process there's these

432
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,349
there's an initial setup that happens in

433
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,750
which the game receives a bunch of

434
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,560
initial data just so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the UI</font>

pops up it's populated with information

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,290
it it is first you send it up your

437
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,939

it sends that back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic and</font>

all of the messaging stuff and stuff

456
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,830
happens is that it is it then transmits

to you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of that chat messaging</font>

462
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,639
to define for instance what are the

463
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,740
various values that are used by the game

464
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,870
to determine whether you're within a

465
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,970
certain range or have a certain level of

that decides how the game is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

their own benefit oh and by the way it

481
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,050
is worth mentioning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

technology thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

487
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,149
that this alien technology is something

488
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is we should be a little wary of we</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the motives of these</font>

490
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,050
aliens maybe we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a step back</font>

491
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and not quite accept it so rapidly the</font>

492
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,889
enlightened are the team whose

493
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,480
philosophy is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should embrace this</font>

494
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,100
they are just nothing but beneficial

495
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,050
everything is good the the all this the

496
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,270
benefits of this technology are good for

497
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,669
everyone why not just embrace it right

498
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,980
it is worth noting that in the internal

499
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:41,350
messaging of the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enlightened</font>

500
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:44,700
team is referred to as aliens so be

501
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:47,040
warned you are working for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aliens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

502
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,560
so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that happens is that</font>

503
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,680
the Niantic app sends a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little handshake</font>

504
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,320
that's called sup and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes</font>

505
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,750
back here here is all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

506
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,970
configuration data that comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

507
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,340
the device right so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned your</font>

508
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,590
gut you've got all the rules for what

509
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,990
are the glyphs that can do things when

510
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,909
you are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do glyph thing to make</font>

511
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,850
the glyphs happen faster give you more

512
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,650
keys the action<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs for different</font>

513
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,780
actions within the game the weapons

514
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,910
radius for different weapons within the

515
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,740
games the badge tears all of this stuff

516
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,900
is transmitted every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time in the</font>

517
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,490
handshake it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really clear to me</font>

518
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,740
why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't just hard coded into the</font>

519
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,050
app but I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

520
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the game on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fly they could literally</font>

521
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,399
just change some settings on the server

522
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then everyone's game would work in</font>

523
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,260
the different way but it just seems to

524
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">me like it's just opportunity for for a</font>

525
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,240
lot of messing around so in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

526
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,919
the app itself the app has several

527
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,650
analytics tools that are built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it</font>

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,680
one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> upstate API and up site</font>

529
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:53,770

completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app</font>

532
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,650
it for doing in-app purchases there are

533
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,080
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can buy for real</font>

accumulate more gear or do other things

537
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,220
within the game that are fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

538
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,410
that gives you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge advantage but some</font>

539
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,480
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives you a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

540
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,940

all this payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> management and and to</font>

00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,149
an enormous amount of device data about

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,679
the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the game</font>

573
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:31,869
on then what happens is as you play the

574
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,359
game there are all these api calls that

575
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:35,470
happen and they again like most of the

576
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,590
other ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening throughout</font>

577
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,570
the game it's an HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> POST up to niantic</font>

578
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,609
with some data and then a response back

579
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,320
and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> names like this and</font>

580
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,210
they're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing things like</font>

581
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,428
updating the inventory of your gear that

585
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,899
basically happening constantly and it's

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you know people who play ingress</font>

589
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:05,259
you always see them carrying these giant

00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:07,479
ass external battery packs and giant

591
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,729

599
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:26,649
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it all happening the</font>

most interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> API call that I see is</font>

601
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:31,238
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's called get paginate</font>

603
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:35,650
interesting

604
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,300
it contains all of the rich juicy detail

605
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,520
about everything that's happening by

606
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,870
other people as well as yourself within

607
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,330
the game it's all those text messages

608
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I mentioned earlier plus all the</font>

609
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:49,030
action messages but in addition to the

texts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actions and which is not</font>

612
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,230
but it's shown it's shown to the API but

613
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,699
not displayed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is things like</font>

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,610
unique user IDs for all the players

615
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,960
unique IDs for all of the portals and

616
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,570
locations in which you're playing as

617
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,800
well as all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the geolocation data for</font>

618
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,720
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these events that are happening</font>

619
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,300
whether they're done by you or by

620
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else so all of this information</font>

621
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,820
is constantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> being fed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone</font>

622
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,919
and because you can receive it all and

623
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,129
can man in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

624
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,310
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of shenanigans that you</font>

625
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,070
can do if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say collect it all we'll</font>

626
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,440
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute what else is</font>

627
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,810
interesting so there was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

628
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,890
session that we decrypted at the at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

629
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,570
end the one that had the weird mac

630
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,820
address problem and it was on this

631
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,260
strange port 70 to 75 and I had to do a

632
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,960
little research on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font>

633
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is this tool called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ULP user</font>

634
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">plain location protocol it's a protocol</font>

635
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:52,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically used by snaps that use</font>

636
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,850
GPS they go out and they receive

637
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,500
telemetry about where in the sky are the

638
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,959
satellites that are above you right now

639
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,810
and it's a way to more quickly get your

640
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,460
GPS to sync and get the location faster

641
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,129
and it was just interesting to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

642
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,690
TLS over this weird port and if you if

643
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the packet itself because</font>

644
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,310
it's not an HTTP packet and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

645
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's so tiny but</font>

646
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,270
like right up here it says degrees of

647
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:20,920
latitude degrees of longitude it's very

648
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:24,340
very precise satellite data with nine or

649
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten degrees of accuracy so it's very</font>

650
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">very precise geolocation data plus all</font>

651
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,300
the error code values so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

652
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,140
the calculation get your your location

653
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,909
down as precisely as possible it's also

654
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth noting at this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

655
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">oooff stuff that Pokemon go is doing is</font>

656
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,539
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see but we're</font>

657
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:47,220
also seeing we also see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

658
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,690
have made some improvements now one of

659
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,179
the is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier one of the</font>

660
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">improvements that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've made is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

661
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,549
they're they're doing a little bit less

662
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the it's a little less obvious</font>

663
00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:01,289
they're not using a user agent string

664
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:04,379
that is directly connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go</font>

665
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,840
the user agent in in ingress as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

666
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:10,109
mentioned is nemesis and they're using

667
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the sort of standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dalvik user</font>

668
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:15,029
agent string that's used by apps that

669
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,100
hook the network device you'll also see

670
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:18,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no chat messaging but</font>

671
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of binary data that's</font>

672
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:22,259
being passed back and forth however the

673
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,269
few things that they are doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

674
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,950
similar is because they're using the

675
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:26,669
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location database and they've</font>

676
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,190
already built an infrastructure

677
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:31,799
involving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you IDs for the locations</font>

678
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,299
the those hash values on the names of

679
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,609
the locations as well as their pictures

680
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,950
are being transmitted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clear in</font>

681
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,869
this in this stuff but is essentially

682
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,389
doing the same thing where it's doing

683
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:44,668
this API HTTP POST stuff back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

684
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:48,228
server getting a response back it just

685
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:50,489
doesn't have nearly as much data in it

686
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:53,519
right oh and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the this is</font>

687
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:55,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot so if you if you</font>

688
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,200
didn't know this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

689
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,389
under 16 I think if your kid playing

690
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,399
pokemon go you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign instead of</font>

691
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:06,119
having a google google account you have

692
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sign up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through Nintendo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has this</font>

693
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,109
thing called the Pokemon trainers club

694
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:11,460
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create an account on</font>

695
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:13,080
Pokemon trainers club and then when you

696
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,379
login instead of going through Google

697
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,668
OAuth it goes through Nintendo's

698
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:19,978
separate Olaf and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

699
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,330
header stuff boy it's a really fuzzy

700
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:22,799
picture I'm sorry is there any way you

701
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,960
could focus the projector a little bit

702
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,609
it's just really blurry but like yeah

703
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,450
this is all the header data that shows

704
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:33,359
they're sending things including it's

705
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:37,139
really hard to see but birth date of the

706
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:39,809
player in that OAuth session data so as

707
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:41,969
well as there's actually parents email

708
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">in there because you have to tie a</font>

709
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:48,570
Pokemon go a kid's account to a parents

710
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:51,059
account so it has uuid stuff and then

711
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,859
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called date of consent</font>

712
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,230
and I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really understand what that</font>

713
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,070
was but in the kids account that I

714
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,340
created I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

715
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:03,009
age<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consent is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually 13 after</font>

716
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">birth date so apparently 13 is the age</font>

717
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:07,299
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> consent as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pokemons go is</font>

718
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,740
concerned that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font>

719
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit about what what you</font>

720
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,659
can do when you can scrape this data and

721
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:16,000
you can suck it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all down so there are</font>

722
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very clever people who have figured</font>

723
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,720
out all of this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've shown</font>

724
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,969
you so far and they have built data

725
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,450
collection systems that are using that

726
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:28,029
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using bogus accounts that are</font>

727
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,100
fake geo-located all over the world to

728
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:31,629
collect all of these player action

729
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,600
things from everywhere in the world

730
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:35,860
simultaneously and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're databasing</font>

731
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,219
that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they've been databasing</font>

732
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,918
it for years they're capturing

733
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,840
decrypting and parsing all of this stuff

734
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,860
and making it searchable with really

735
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,689
nice UI there are at least three of

736
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,330
these for each faction and it's been a

737
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,460
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open secret among the ingress</font>

738
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:59,590
community that this exists for some time

739
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:02,409
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does violate the the Niantic</font>

740
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,939
terms of service to be doing this but

741
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,919
more importantly and the reason that i'm

742
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,960
talking about it is that it opens up a

743
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,409
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to do some</font>

744
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,570
really bad things so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just got back</font>

745
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:15,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the UK and one of the things i did</font>

746
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,360
of course i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was playing ingress when i</font>

747
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,889
was there because it was exciting and

748
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,199
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> badges you can get is for</font>

749
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:22,240
capturing the portal that you've never

750
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,009
captured before for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

751
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,409
was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all these uniques and</font>

752
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:29,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very proud of the fact that when i</font>

753
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:31,179
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> North Wales I captured every</font>

754
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,250
World Heritage Site castle in North

755
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,750
Wales that was that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> my big victory</font>

756
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,480
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was so proud I took</font>

757
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,789
screenshots of it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Conway</font>

758
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">caernarfon and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beaumaris are the three</font>

759
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:43,120
world heritage sites and the coolest

760
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,360
thing about winter capsule is it's known

761
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,629
as the most haunted castle in England or

762
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,918
in the UK so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got the most haunted</font>

763
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:53,408
castle and the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> World Heritage</font>

764
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sites but little did I know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while i</font>

765
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:57,850
was doing this one of these player

766
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:59,799
trackers was monitoring mine and every

767
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,230
other player in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world's use of the</font>

768
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,350
game and created this heat map that

769
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:07,690
shows exactly where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was and how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

770
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,459
spent in using the game at these

771
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,960
different locations in North Wales and

772
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,539
when I saw this at<font color="#E5E5E5"> scare</font>

773
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,610
the crap out of me because again it's

774
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:17,260
only an academic exercise to understand

775
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,080
that what these player trackers are able

776
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,590
to do is keep track of an enormous

777
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of location data let you view by</font>

778
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,029
time slice where that location data is

779
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,428
and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> further you can slice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font>

780
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,200
to morning afternoon evening like what

781
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:34,990
is the propensity of a certain player to

782
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,730
be in a certain place at between<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

783
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,080
o'clock and ten o'clock in the morning

784
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,760
well you might find the neighborhood

785
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the person lives you might find</font>

786
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,059
where their office is where they

787
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,590
frequent where they go shopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

788
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,690
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop their kids off from school and</font>

789
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">then hack the portal at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the church down</font>

790
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,730

791
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,620
this can be abused so here's another

view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a different player tracker this</font>

00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">are that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> located in northern</font>

00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:07,720
the players in my faction to monitor

00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:10,659
players on our faction who we knew were

798
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,059
doing bad stuff and so they're the ones

that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray are real players and</font>

this green<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray shading are the players</font>

804
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:26,469
who are using what we think are spoof

805
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,090
accounts or<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot accounts to conduct</font>

themselves in ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">befitting a player who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is responsible</font>

808
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,830
and respectable here's a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

809
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,770
of a different player<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracker showing</font>

810
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,600
the details of a particular spoofer who

811
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,480
we know was doing some really bad stuff

812
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,158
and again it's really hard to see but

813
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just show you that it's it's got</font>

814
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,380
the the names the<font color="#E5E5E5"> days owned and the</font>

815
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,510
date of each captured portal that this

816
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,830
guy had under his control and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

817
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,260
there's a little button here that says

add<font color="#E5E5E5"> to threat watch so that if there are</font>

players who are on this green faction

820
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:03,789
who were causing problems for other

821
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,890
people the<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of the blue faction</font>

822
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,960
who run this particular tracker were

823
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,240
able to put this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a watch list</font>

824
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,070
so they could keep a closer eye on them

825
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,510
and collect more data<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them and get</font>

826
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,570
alerts on when they were doing certain

827
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:19,450
things and you know again it was it

828
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,418
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> lead to shenanigans so this is</font>

829
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,890
this is a yet a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different player</font>

about my account it shows that my region

region that I'm in as being the place

834
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,400
where I hacked my very first portal

835

which happens to be near Bluecoats

836

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,580
my trip but then there's some of these

852
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,050
ones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Colorado and then the</font>

853
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,720
one that is grayed out with the name

854
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:22,810
bust is my guardian portal and it's hard

855
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see but it says it's 262 days it</font>

856
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,139
turns out that while I was in the UK I

857
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,520
made the I made a grave error I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

858
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,170
met with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people who are on</font>

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">my faction who I thought were friendly</font>

860
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,290
players and we had hung out and had a

861
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,570
few beers and played a little bit and

862
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,520
gotten together a few times and I told

863
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy said like hey you know do</font>

864
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good good guardians you know</font>

865
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,520
there's a couple portals around here

866
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,920
that had some good guardians and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent</font>

867
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,920
the guy a screenshot that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

868
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,160
guardian list was up to over 250 days

869
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,140
and within 48 hours of having that

870
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation my guardian got taken down</font>

871
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,660
my guardian by the way is somewhere in

872
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:04,360
Texas so<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever it was that that</font>

873
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,970
information got to used a system that

874
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,219
was just like this used a bot to go to

875
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Texas and killed my guardian where they</font>

bought not cool of course I'd already

877
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,909
gotten the badge so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font>

878
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">at that point it was just you know gravy</font>

879
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,130
exactly it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a pet so so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues right so it allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to to</font>

881
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,260
find track and observe the behavior of

like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

891
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:51,598
course of doing the research for this

892
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:53,940
talk I put out a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer thing</font>

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,230
on reddit as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

894
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,029
interviewed a bunch of players that I

00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,650
know and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences</font>

00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,690
that I've had with other players in my

deliberately done things to harass them

903
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,390
as a way to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it make it harder for</font>

them to play the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to drive them</font>

905
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,220
out of the game this is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

906
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:24,930
is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go away unless we solve</font>

907
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,669
the problem of this scraping all right

908
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:32,009
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about what these</font>

909
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:33,749
BOTS can do so GPS spoofing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots has</font>

910
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:35,299
been a problem within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game pretty</font>

911
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">much since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it started as you can imagine</font>

912
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:40,920
we're in a game in which hacking is part

913
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,859
of the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thematic storyline of the</font>

914
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,569
game it attracts a certain audience of

915
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:48,450
people who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in exploration</font>

918
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,629
discovered fairly early on that there

919
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">are these GPS spoofing apps that you</font>

920
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,910
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for development purposes of</font>

921
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,470
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to force your phone to say</font>

00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,118
that it is in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> location and</font>

923
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:07,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">then everything that kind of pulls that</font>

924
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,119
location data from the phone thinks it's

925

in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different place and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then it can you</font>

sort of two purposes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get into</font>

00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">those in a minute for definition of</font>

purposes spoo furs are just people using

these tools to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forge your GPS and make</font>

00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:37,078
are using spoofing to do actions

automatically without human interaction

the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important to</font>

940
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:49,710
note is that spoofing is something that

941
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">niantic is trying very very hard 24</font>

pretty quickly the the purpose of having

950
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,890
they're looking specifically for these

00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:15,750
apps running in the background and the

952
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that you hide these in the</font>

information about these apps from

run this thing called the xposed

959
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,359
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a kind of a high barrier to</font>

960
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,020
entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you have to sideload it</font>

961
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,690
using an<font color="#CCCCCC"> android desktop bus you have to</font>

962
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,390
adb flash it onto the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and so it</font>

963
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably beyond the Ken of most</font>

mortal people who have android phones

965
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,000
however I believe everyone in the room

966
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,609
here is probably capable of doing it

967

themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font>

method of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spoofing so that you</font>

avoid getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> banned and kicked out of</font>

970
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,680
the game and losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the gear that</font>

00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you illicitly got so some of the things</font>

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bots can do are basically</font>

everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do within the</font>

974
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,380
game so there they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can hack org lift the</font>

975
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,570
portals they can retrieve keys and get

976
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,880
gear they follow certain tracks you can

977
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">record a GPS track and then have your</font>

978
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS follow that track almost like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

979
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,780
like you're playing back a video they

980
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:24,570
can attack enemy portals as they walk

981
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,520
past them they can also just teleport

982
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,859
jump from place to place in a

983
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,290
ridiculously short amount of time amount

984

of time that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human would notice very</font>

985
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:37,470
quickly is far too rapidly so for

986
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:39,509
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I flew between Denver and Las</font>

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,680
Vegas it's about a 90-minute flight and

988
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:46,560
yet you know I could if I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,020
in boulder where I live teleport back to

995
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,240
everything and what they are being used

996
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:08,069
or is there using them for harvesting

997
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,160
huge amounts of the highest level gear

998
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:13,109
which is a mentally and physically

taxing effort as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

don't just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these portals and hack</font>

1001
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:21,299
them one time if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to farm gear</font>

say for an anomaly that's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

1003
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:25,470
will often find that one faction or the

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,839
other we'll get together they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

park<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has five or six or ten portals</font>

1007
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,000
will then<font color="#E5E5E5"> level those portals up so that</font>

1008
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,740
they give the highest level of gear and

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">then people will walk around and glyph</font>

them for hours and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this takes a</font>

1011
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,470
lot of work and takes a lot of effort

1012
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,140
and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the glyph</font>

1014
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,460
from my own experience is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trivial</font>

1015
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,650
exercise it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that takes a</font>

1016
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,990
lot of work and yet these BOTS can

1017
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,500
basically glyph everything as fast as

1018
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:57,569
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the only way that you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS is that you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dial it back a</font>

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit because the bot is so good</font>

1023
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,150
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attract notice and so a</font>

1024
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,029
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these sliders that are in these</font>

1025
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,190
bots are to control just how accurate

1026
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:13,200
like how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> will it fail and how</font>

1027
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">often will it will it meander off this</font>

1028
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,950
GPS track and look like you're just kind

1029
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,480
of walking across the street instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1030
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,609
following a straight line and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1031
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,200
digging<font color="#E5E5E5"> a left turn making it a 45</font>

1032
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:24,089
degree turn and going across a field

1033
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,460
that normally is blocked off with a

1034
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:29,190
chain-link fence all of this stuff is

1035
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,099
basically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bot work</font>

1036
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,349
faster right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these</font>

1037
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:35,700
infographics and again it's really hard

1038
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,279
to read but this is an infographic about

1039
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,140
how i bought works and what these farm

with specifically to to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1043
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,950
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these bots are doing farming</font>

1044
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,900
and how you identify the farming<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots as</font>

1045
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,439
opposed to the bots that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

to spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> and attack people so the the</font>

called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gannett</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's $12 to use it for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">three months and it is shamelessly</font>

advertising itself as being<font color="#E5E5E5"> V bot to do</font>

1053
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:13,950
everything bad within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the game now it's</font>

1054
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,990
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very it's a very paranoid guy</font>

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,828
who's in Eastern Europe makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots</font>

when you

1057
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:22,170
by it they make a build that is just for

1058
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,879
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the bot itself does some command</font>

and control back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys web server</font>

calls itself internally bad logic now

1068
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,140
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just some internals of</font>

Guinness and showing you the UI and and

1070
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,129
then for example this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the walk</font>

1071
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,839
mode where you can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> either have</font>

1072
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:55,079
it walk in a straight line or walk and

1073
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,869
then loop back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the I've done</font>

1074
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,039
a little bit of reversing of the app and

1075
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's showing some of the source code and</font>

1076
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,759
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drop-down of the code</font>

1077
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:04,339
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the code is pretty</font>

1078
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:06,719
heavily off you skated with all this

1079
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:08,249
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this sort of junk text</font>

1080
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's all through all the variables and</font>

1081
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:10,769
stuff it just makes it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder</font>

1082
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">to read but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody who's an</font>

experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverser it's sort of</font>

1084
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:16,200
rudimentary but you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1085
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,119
good ass you can actually there are some

1086
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,968
commercial emulators out there that you

1087
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,170
can use to to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into these things one</font>

1088
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:24,180
of them is this one that's called the

1089
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">NOx a player and it's worth noting in</font>

1090
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,169
the text at the bottom here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

1091
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,670
location required by app the virtual

1092
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,459
location feature will pin you to

1093
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">wherever you want now this one I showed</font>

1094
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:36,899
because they're actually advertising a

1095
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,969
particular build that you can get of

1096
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,880
this app that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go</font>

1097
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:43,949
desktop and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> was of it was you</font>

1098
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,630
can play pokemon on your desktop without

1099
00:42:43,949 --> 00:42:48,209
ever having to walk out into the real

1100
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,680
world well guess what it still works it

1101
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:51,509
was advertised as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1102
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,578
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use during the beta and now it</font>

1103
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:56,039
still works with the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon now</font>

1104
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:57,809
and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i can tell i've been using</font>

1105
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,690
it for weeks and it hasn't gotten me

1106
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,579
banned so so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still functional now</font>

1107
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,579
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another company that does a</font>

1108
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:07,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar app called genymotion but you do</font>

1109
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,709
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the xposed framework on</font>

1110
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:13,198
these software<font color="#CCCCCC"> android devices or else</font>

1111
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:15,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually you will get caught band and</font>

1112
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,119
you'll lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your lovely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon and</font>

1113

hacking fake ime<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can create your</font>

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">own phone number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and phone network that</font>

1128
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,740
you're on all of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically just</font>

1129
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:55,880
forgery that allows these apps to work

1130
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:59,299
again for development purposes haha<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1131
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,970
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> but everything about this just</font>

1132
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:05,110
really sucks and what this does is it

1133
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:08,240
feeds this market for black-market gear

1134
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:10,190
both factions are responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1135
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,470
running these<font color="#E5E5E5"> gannett spots they give</font>

1136
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:15,260
out the gear in huge amounts to their

1137
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,089
buddies because it really is trivial for

1138
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to collect massive</font>

1139
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,530
amounts of gear but then they turn

1140
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,810
around and sell it for dollars on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1141
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,910
web and these guys are advertising this

1142
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff on the chat window to all the</font>

1143
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,680
players the one I like the most is this

1144
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,960
one here it says for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks will give</font>

1145
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,879
you four keys to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any one portal that you</font>

1146
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,010
want anywhere in the world and to me

1147
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,870
that's amazing because you know if i

1148
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,360
wanted to i could pay this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 bucks</font>

1149
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,970
he sends his<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot down to McMurdo Station</font>

1150
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,800
in Antarctica where the two portals that

1151
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,660
are the rarest portals in the world are

1152
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,940
because only the 50 scientists that go

1153
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,129
to the South Pole and are there can hack

1154
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,500
those portals and this guy will give me

1155
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,540
four of those keys for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 bucks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woohoo</font>

1156
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,630
what an achievement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't actually</font>

1157
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,270
been to McMurdo that sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ruins</font>

1158
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,540
the game for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone and and honestly</font>

1159
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:07,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that is exactly the problem with</font>

1160
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of this stuff it violates the spirit</font>

1161
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:12,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the letter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rules and it just</font>

1162
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:15,140
makes everyone in the game pissed off at

1163
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:18,169
each other both factions accuse the

1164
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">other side of cheating it's true both</font>

1165
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,210
sides are cheating it's become an arms

1166
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:25,460
race and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

1167
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:30,050
going to go away as long as the game

1168
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,820
allows it to happen so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1169
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,580
how we address these problems because

1170
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:37,280
the real problem is that niantic is a

1171
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,950
company with great intentions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

1172
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,900
to hit games on their hands but does not

1173
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">have more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than 50 employees it is</font>

1174
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,609
basically lost at trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve these</font>

1175
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,379
problems they're overwhelmed by the

1176
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:51,808
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playing pokemon</font>

1177
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,539
go the the it you know when I pitched

1178
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:57,869
this talk to the conference it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1179
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these discussions about</font>

1180
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,660
the problems that we're going to happen

1181
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">with our vented reality games we're</font>

1182
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,960
hypothetical or there have been you know

1183
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,939
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of instances here and there of</font>

1184
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,410
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know falling off their bikes</font>

1185
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,440
are getting into car crashes but it

1186
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,420
wasn't on the scale of today where the

1187
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,670
police departments in New York San

1188
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,670
Francisco Los<font color="#E5E5E5"> Angeles and Boston are</font>

1189
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,799
sending out<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon go player tips like</font>

1190
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,420
don't walk into really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad neighborhoods</font>

1191
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:23,069
late at night all by yourself with your

1192
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,020
really expensive phone and big battery

1193
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:26,970
without hanging out you know you're

1194
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get mugged you know and stuff</font>

1195
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this what's all hypothetical two</font>

1196
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:34,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now what's happening every</font>

1197
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,879
day so we got to solve this so one of

1198
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest problems is this data</font>

1199
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,539
scraping issue where that basically

1200
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,368
you're walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around with a GPS tracker</font>

1201
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:43,619
in your pocket that shows everyone where

1202
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:45,359
you are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time these are my</font>

1203
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:49,020
suggestions we got to stop broadcasting

1204
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:52,288
the player data with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actions in the</font>

1205
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:55,589
game so when it says Andy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brant hacked</font>

1206
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:58,369
portal X or<font color="#CCCCCC"> aunty Brant attacked this</font>

1207
00:46:55,589 --> 00:47:00,480
portal and captured it from player why

1208
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:03,809
you should never have names associated

1209
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,089
with that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be portal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X is</font>

1210
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:08,490
under attack portal<font color="#E5E5E5"> X has been captured</font>

1211
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,589
by the other side that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would eliminate</font>

1212
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,750
all of this player tracking stuff in

1213
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:14,250
which this data is being sent out and

1214
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are scraping it and show it the</font>

1215
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,270
heat map thing that shows where you are

1216
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,808
would be gone everything has to be

1217
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:23,339
encrypted right it is a watchword of all

1218
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:25,319
of what we do in infosec encrypt

1219
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,000
everything you possibly can now it's

1220
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:28,950
inside TLS and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great because the</font>

1221
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,260
transport layer is an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font>

1222
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,720
encrypt but why is the data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaintext</font>

1223
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">why is this all JSON inside in plain</font>

1224
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,459
text inside of the TLS they learned this

1225
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:40,920
lesson with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go that's a good</font>

1226
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing they need to then revert and put</font>

1227
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,839
that stuff in to ingress it needs to be

1228
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:47,910
encrypting that data so that all that

1229
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,670
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing across the wire is a big</font>

1230
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,520
binary data blob that we cannot read and

1231
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:55,109
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> ingress and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic needs to</font>

1232
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,710
be monitoring the players<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their</font>

1233
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:59,520
activity

1234
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:02,730
a little more closely location service

1235
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,200
stuff is another issue right so when in

1236
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,490
all my malware research stuff I'm always

1237
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,770
looking for metadata attribute

1238
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,660
combinations that will lead me to find

1239
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,940
interesting traffic well here's a

1240
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,250
metadata attribute that I love check the

1241
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">geoip of the IP address you're using and</font>

1242
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:19,859
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that correlate to anywhere near or</font>

1243
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,570
even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same country as the the IP</font>

1244
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:24,089
address the geolocation data that's

1245
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:27,839
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS if you're if you're</font>

1246
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:30,210
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UK and your phone says you're in</font>

1247
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Texas but you're on a UK network</font>

1248
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,859
connection something is wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1249
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,040
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic isn't seeing this is</font>

1250
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,299
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong it has to be pointed out to</font>

1251
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,240
them by the players that's the biggest

1252
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem is that there are communities of</font>

1253
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,009
like-minded you know interested players

1254
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,320
who want to stop these guys but they

1255
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:55,200
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to report all of this stuff up to</font>

1256
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">niantic niantic has the data all right</font>

1257
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then player behavior right so one of</font>

1258
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest issues with Pokemon go has</font>

1259
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:05,069
been that players are now showing up at

1260
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:07,369
you know austere locations like the

1261
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:11,070
National Holocaust Museum and veterans

1262
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:13,020
memorials and other plates graveyards

1263
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,030
and other places where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't just go</font>

1264
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,920
and set up a bunch of folding chairs and

1265
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,660
bust out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boombox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and start having a</font>

1266
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,230
party at two in the morning and

1267
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:25,020
capturing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon we as ingress players</font>

1268
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,240
need to bring them into the fold of what

1269
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,369
is the appropriate behavioral mores of

1270
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,680
using augmented reality and it is not

1271
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:33,869
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a goddamn nuisance of yourself</font>

1272
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,460
and leaving trash and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font>

1273
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:37,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ingress players as well as the</font>

1274
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pokemon players are all demonized</font>

1275
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,710
because we're nuisances do you have a

1276
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,710
comment

1277
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:53,369
so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so so ingress that so</font>

1278
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,319
the question was are you not limited to

1279
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:58,049
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many times you can spin a poky stop</font>

1280
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:59,640
in six hours so in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon the way</font>

1281
00:49:58,049 --> 00:50:01,380
that you gather gears<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to these</font>

1282
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,549
locations which are portals and some of

1283
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,109
them are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called pokey stops</font>

1284
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:06,150
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to them there's like a</font>

1285
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:08,308
circular thing and you drag your finger

1286
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,609
across it and it spins and then little

1287
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">like stuff will fall out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it there is</font>

1288
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">a delay so you can do it once and then</font>

1289
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait five minutes just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1290
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:17,849
when you hack a portal you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait</font>

1291
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,710
approximately five minutes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

1292
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,960
cool down and then you can hack it again

1293
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,720
I don't know because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually not I</font>

1294
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough work on Pokemon go</font>

1295
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,509
I've only been playing it for a couple

1296
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,129
of weeks does anyone know can you keep

1297
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:31,130
spinning it every five minutes forever

1298
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:43,890
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so so that is a good</font>

1299
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:46,589
point so so in ingress you can hack four

1300
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,210
times short of putting special gear on

1301
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:50,190
the portals to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it more</font>

1302
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,140
you can hack something four times

1303
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:54,030
there's a five minute gap between each

1304
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,069
time and then the portal becomes burned

1305
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,799
out and you can't use it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> about six</font>

1306
00:50:56,069 --> 00:51:00,990
hours so it forces people to move on but

1307
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:03,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">yes it is my understanding that you</font>

1308
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:05,339
can't do this isn't the case in Pokemon

1309
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:07,140
go and yeah that's that's a problem like

1310
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:09,680
there needs to be poor you know pokey

1311
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,910
stop burnout so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will just leave</font>

1312
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,879
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the suggestions that a colleague</font>

1313
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:18,589
of mine made was that maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic</font>

1314
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,210
should create a very low cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a paid</font>

1315
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,500
private ingress universe<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

1316
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,319
parallel to the existing ingress

1317
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:28,049
universe for free users but where they

1318
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:30,180
have a payment method<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a way of</font>

1319
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:33,930
contacting you that ties you to a real

1320
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,720
person's information and if that account

1321
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,089
is found to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing bad stuff with bots</font>

1322
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,419
or spoofing or doing other goofy stuff

1323
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:44,940
that that account can be banned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

1324
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,359
account can be banned permanently across

1325
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,540
anybody anybody's game that<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic is</font>

1326
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:53,130
running in which they're using you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1327
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,080
the same payment information so

1328
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,910
basically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> banned</font>

1329
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,680
the credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using to pay</font>

1330
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,390
and then they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into any</font>

1331
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,980
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic game with an account that</font>

1332
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:03,259
has tied to that credit card I mean

1333
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one suggestion but I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1334
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,700
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and I don't know do we have a</font>

1335
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,440
mic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pass around to people</font>

1336
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,660
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and if you've got comments</font>

1337
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm here to hear your suggestions and</font>

1338
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just type them in as you guys are</font>

1339
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:18,140
talking about them so one of the ones it

1340
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:24,770
was suggested was the portal<font color="#CCCCCC"> burnout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1341
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:33,100
pokey stops are there any others yeah

1342
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:36,200
speak out so if you make a payment at

1343
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:39,490
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Vegas but then you make a</font>

1344
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:42,970
payment somewhere somewhere in the UK

1345
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:45,109
you can't like they have they have some

1346
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:48,230
mechanism for knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't</font>

1347
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,520
physically make that that distance in

1348
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:52,130
the time so they could implement

1349
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,280
something like that in terms of their

1350
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:58,250
the user's interaction so it would it

1351
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,810
would stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS from teleporting right</font>

1352
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,580
well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting</font>

1353
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,860
suggestion so the one the one thing that

1354
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:06,020
that you should note is that the people

1355
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,880
who are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS create they create</font>

1356
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,220
completely separate accounts to play the

1357
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,620
game that are not tied to their their

1358
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,270
real ingress player account and they do

1359
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,880
that because they're afraid that at any

1360
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">time niantic could just kill that could</font>

1361
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,460
kill that account and they lose

1362
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:21,230
everything that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that account so</font>

1363
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,780
they don't usually use those with any of

1364
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment stuff but yes this does come</font>

1365
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:29,750
down to you know is this person

1366
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:31,700
habitually playing in the US and is this

1367
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,470
credit card habitually used in the u.s.

1368
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,759
like maybe they can do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1369
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:40,370
know whether they have that payment card

1370
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:42,290
information yeah they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they</font>

1371
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:43,880
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not share it sorry goes well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1372
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,820
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily mean the credit card</font>

1373
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,100
information but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have they have a</font>

1374
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,200
mechanism of knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ok there's a</font>

1375
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,670
transaction here right the cart the card

1376
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,990
companies have this mechanism for

1377
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,370
knowing where the card gets used but I

1378
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:59,120
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they share that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1379
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:02,319
vendors or you who are using that sorry

1380
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,319
go ahead get in the back

1381
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:15,620
we'll follow the money if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1382
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,700
bot account what is the bot generating

1383
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,620
you're not going to have a bot account

1384
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,230
without it generating some value to you

1385
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:23,000
and if it's generating a value all of

1386
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:26,090
the stuff you want to give away look at

1387
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,590
who it's giving it to right so one of

1388
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,660
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens in the game is</font>

1389
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,790
that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two items called</font>

1390
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,220
capsules and capsules can hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 other</font>

1391
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:38,029
items and the capsules when they're

1392
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:40,069
filled get a unique is it 10 or 12

1393
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:42,560
carries<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hexadecimal character code</font>

1394
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:45,950
that uniquely identifies that capsule it

1395
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:49,299
should be rudimentary for ingress<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

1396
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:51,910
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to track player</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

1397
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,070
created this value put it in a capsule

1398
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:58,009
dropped it on the ground player 2 came

1399
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:00,290
and picked up that capsule and benefited

1400
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">from it why are they not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at that</font>

1401
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:03,890
that is if that is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the very</font>

1402
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,810
good questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the one of the</font>

1403
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,790
weak points in the game is that they're

1404
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:10,759
not looking at this interaction the way

1405
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:13,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those farm sites work where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy</font>

1406
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,650
the black market gear is they tell you

1407
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,600
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay you pay for the gear</font>

1408
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,280
and then they say let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us know when</font>

1409
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,200
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be online and then you</font>

1410
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,030
need to give us your very accurate gps

1411
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,009
information and then they do some tests

1412
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,500
drops of gear they'll drop a low value

1413
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:30,020
item on the ground and if you see that

1414
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,880
appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your scanner then they drop a</font>

1415
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,860
capsule full of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that you paid</font>

1416
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,150
for on the ground there doing that with

1417
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,650
bots and the reason they need your

1418
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,690
location is because they need to type it

1419
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:41,120
into the bots little address bar and

1420
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:43,220
then it sends it just teleports to that

1421
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:47,509
location drops the gear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then logs</font>

1422
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:50,299
out so again you know if you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1423
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,250
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track when capsule a goes to</font>

1424
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:55,070
player from player<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to play or two</font>

1425
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:58,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> player 1 is the purveyor of</font>

1426
00:55:55,070 --> 00:56:00,080
this gear store and you lock them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1427
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:03,259
the game or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it harder for</font>

1428
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:05,630
them sorry the person who's behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I</font>

1429
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:09,080
to question um there may be a way to

1430
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:11,810
isolate assisted GPS from GPS data and

1431
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,730
correlate the two so if if say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1432
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,310
assisted GPS data say says you're

1433
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:18,170
somewhere in Las Vegas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your GPS data</font>

1434
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:21,170
being spoofed suddenly says you're in

1435
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:22,360
you know somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> East Southeast</font>

1436
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Asia</font>

1437
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:31,990
that would be a direct red flag so if

1438
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:34,600
there was some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of requiring the</font>

1439
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,799
phone to have a true assisted<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

1440
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,850
because if you're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

1441
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,310
to a cell tower you're going to be

1442
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data anyway yes so this is</font>

1443
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually an interesting point and this</font>

1444
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,860
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the metadata attributes that</font>

1445
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,630
the analytics tools within ingress or

1446
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,300
collecting they're collecting

1447
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,370
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi access points</font>

1448
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,520
that are in your area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're using</font>

1449
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google's ability to search for a</font>

1450
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:02,110
location by network to correlate are you

1451
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,720
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gps says you are do you see</font>

1452
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:07,570
the Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> ApS that should be in the same</font>

1453
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">location and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why exposed works</font>

1454
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,260
because exposed prevents the app from

1455
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:15,310
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see what are the nearby</font>

1456
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:17,200
Wi-Fi access points so so they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1457
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to a certain extent whether or not</font>

1458
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:23,379
it's it's effective is another thing

1459
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:25,870
sorry person in green yes hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I wanted</font>

1460
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:29,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring up the credit card verification</font>

1461
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:31,450
and in thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of points</font>

1462
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:33,880
I've experienced using credit card

1463
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:36,040
verification upping the ante so then you

1464
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,560
have to deal with fraudulent credit card

1465
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,300
numbers because you by using a credit

1466
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,220
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're creating a situation where</font>

1467
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,190
those who really want to do bad things

1468
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,839
will do it by also stealing credit cards

1469
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,340
just a factor and the other one being<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1470
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,380
was thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> with credit card</font>

1471
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,570
verification granted there's already the

1472
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:54,520
barrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> of entry to having a handheld</font>

1473
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:57,130
device but if we want more people to be

1474
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:00,690
able to put to play the game a credit

1475
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requires a level of privilege or</font>

1476
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:05,170
financial in how old you are and all of

1477
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,750
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also make it more</font>

1478
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated so my challenge is and</font>

1479
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:13,030
generally for the internet how can we

1480
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a verification that isn't tied to</font>

1481
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:17,470
credit cards which are kind of us-based

1482
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,480
not everywhere in the world and like all

1483
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:21,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things I don't have any good</font>

1484
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,660
answers but I would love that to be a

1485
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,090
thing those are those are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1486
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestions and good questions and yeah</font>

1487
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,940
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as i do more research</font>

1488
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,560
on this and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be presenting</font>

1489
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,180
updates to this talk at other

1490
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,750
conferences I'll look into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1491
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,200
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good suggestion thank you</font>

1492
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:37,010
so it'll be taking the last question

1493
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,169
yeah so we're running out of time

1494
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,580
there's drinking to be done so last

1495
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,590
question and then you guys can all go

1496
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,150
but I really but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say before I</font>

1497
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:45,650
get this question I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

1498
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">all for sticking it out right to the end</font>

1499
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:50,690
I really appreciate this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a topic that</font>

1500
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,160
I'm very passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font>

1501
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,920
appreciate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attendance and</font>

1502
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,720
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest level from</font>

1503
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,280
everyone who's here so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1504
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,859
right what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question all right so</font>

1505
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,170
um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the GPS data is a</font>

1506
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:05,330
perfect candidate for applying machine

1507
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,360
learning to train a model to

1508
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:10,190
differentiate between real gps versus

1509
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,620
these spots that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty</font>

1510
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:14,030
rudimentary<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's any</font>

1511
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,000
advanced programming techniques or

1512
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:18,830
anything in them you may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

1513
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,450
machine learning is probably one of the

1514
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,910
tools that they're they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1515
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:24,890
develop internally at<font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic from my</font>

1516
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:28,040
understanding it's very limited because

1517
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:30,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I tried to reach out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> niantic to tried</font>

1518
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,230
to contact John Hanke their CEO several

1519
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,540
times in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks leading up to this</font>

1520
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,620
and and they're just really busy with

1521
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,540
this other game that they're dealing

1522
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:40,100
with and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues so they didn't</font>

1523
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:41,630
have time to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but i'm hoping i</font>

1524
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,759
get an opportunity to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1525
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,380
they've been receptive in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past to</font>

1526
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,920
suggestions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and</font>

1527
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1528
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,910
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is is there any way for</font>

1529
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,589
the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect whether it's running</font>

1530
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:58,290
the xposed framework and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the answer</font>

1531
00:59:55,589 --> 01:00:00,509
is no because the xposed framework the

1532
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,310
way you install it it installs as root

1533
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:10,320
and you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> install it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using like a</font>

1534
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:12,599
third party sorry yes you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

1535
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party bootloader right so so you</font>

1536
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:16,380
flat you flash it if the lower level

1537
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,790
then the operating system and nothing on

1538
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:22,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system can see it unless</font>

1539
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:24,450
it lets it so yeah it's it's tricky so I

1540
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:26,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess we're out of time so thank you so</font>

1541
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:28,049
much but I'll be around here for

1542
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:29,520
questions afterwards and then by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1543
