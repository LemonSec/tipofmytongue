00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,510
I actually posted something to slide out

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,570
read making<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weak passwords dice</font>

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,899
where hex is a what I think that one of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earliest probably the earliest</font>

memory intensive hash and dice we're

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,059
doing very well there people have on

their own translated into a number of

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,830
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> dice where wordless in 17</font>

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,439
are familiar with dice were I've seen it

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,369
or how many use it right that's par for

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,000
the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another little thing i</font>

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,869
did was this is a dice where we're

random sentences and the distribution of

the enterprises which is the topic here

enterprises have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

store for every one of their users some

things like throttling how many online

login attempts happen per unit time but

87
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,160
there's this whole problem of offline

88
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,370
attacks the difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that databases</font>

89
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,299
that are in use are very hard to protect

90
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,739
the databases are frequently stolen and

91
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,660
just encrypting people say well just

92
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,350
encrypt the passwords I think as most of

case is just to store the raw password

there's still some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that</font>

121
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,940
unfortunately we find out simple hashing

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,550
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with that because you</font>

126
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:49,010
increasingly vulnerable because as

you'll see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide the computing</font>

power available to the attackers is just

129
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:59,540
getting larger and larger so people come

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">up with the idea of memory intensive</font>

threshold a little higher for the

you know and all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they help</font>

145
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,950
but they don't really solve the problem

147
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:48,110
in the this presentation it's a good

148
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,719
solution in some sense you'll see rock

149
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,880
salt has a lot in common with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

150
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,610
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single point of failure you</font>

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,070
know we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what how exactly we</font>

store these the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the hash it's a</font>

154
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,409
it's in stolen or not stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

155
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,680
there's an arms race going on here

156
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the protectors of password</font>

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,790

158
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,170
crackers are winning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a bunch</font>

of reasons for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of which of</font>

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,520
course is our favorite Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font>

161
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,950
that's another thing I guess Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law</font>

162
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,760
and passwords have a lot in common their

death is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> being predicted but they</font>

never seem to quite die but another big

167
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,690
has focused a lot of development work on

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,640
building very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-performance graphics</font>

than<font color="#E5E5E5"> adequate for calculating the</font>

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,090

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good at attacking large</font>

numbers of doing large numbers of

175
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,260
password guesses at the same time so

176
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,260
even though the the hash assaulted the

177
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,080
GPUs can handle that memory intensive

178
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,780
hashes help but again GPUs are getting

179
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,109
bigger just a matter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time before they</font>

180
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,030
get big enough and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally you've</font>

181
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,210
got the whole issue of botnets which

182

means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's criminal elements have</font>

attacking pass password hashes that they

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,550
get hold of them and the cracking

187
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,370
problem is of course massively parallel

188
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,729
you can't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a better solution for</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's a recent story that</font>

climb a hill that's a little bit too

211
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,800

passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people reuse passwords so</font>

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,449

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry the problem is</font>

users to fix this problem at some point

219
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,819
you know there has to be some way to

220
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,029
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that is not dependent on</font>

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,640
users being ever more diligent and

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:13,199
memorizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> evermore longer passwords and</font>

224
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,109
enterprise databases present an extra

225
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,719
set of security challenges because

226
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,339
they're in heavy use and that means

227
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,990
there are multiple applications from

228
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,199
multiple computers some of them

229
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,160
accessing remotely you can encrypting

230
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:31,029
databases I mean it does this whole

231
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,390
technology being developed called<font color="#CCCCCC"> houma</font>

232
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:37,480
graphic encryption hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yeah right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

233
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,800
that right anyway where you can actually

234
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,670
manipulate the data while still

235
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,229
encrypted but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cutting edge</font>

236
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,560
research and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear will ever be</font>

237
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,819
really practical enough for day-to-day

238
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,209
use but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general the problem with</font>

239
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,589
encrypting a database is that you know

240
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,839
the encryption key

241
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,940
to be in the computer to access the

242
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,300
database in at some point this this

243
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,000
becomes sort of meaningless also

244
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,400
password databases have to be backed up

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,710
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be synchronized all this</font>

246
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,810
adds more tax surface and more more

247
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,580
potential vulnerability and the volume

248
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">of password information is fairly small</font>

249
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,440
I did a quick back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an envelope</font>

250
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,330
calculation for 200 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> username 200</font>

251
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,940
million users the name the<font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

252
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,730
hash plus salt less than 10 gigabytes

253
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,770
and these days you know 10 gigabytes you

254
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,110
know isn't real is too inadequate for my

255
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,360
watch you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it fits in your</font>

256
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,990
pocket and if you take the thing apart

257
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,340
you can probably you know swallow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

258
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,520
it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

259
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,500
physically and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacker</font>

260
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,380
doesn't need the entire file attacker

261
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,810
gets a you know can get a few hundred

262
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:52,390
kilobytes of the of the password or even

263
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,500
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cape of the password you know you</font>

264
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,610
they have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack okay</font>

265
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,360
they're a bunch of alternatives to

266
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,820
factor in biometric they're cumbersome

267
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,160
adoption has been slow the typical user

268
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,760
has lots of accounts so that right now

269
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dongle for your</font>

bank or dongle for your your company

271
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,070
thing but how many dongles you're going

272
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,920
to carry around it as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

273
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,790
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no good standards yet for</font>

prevent that will no doubt present

another whole level of attack it was

277
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,780
earlier report and I guess it was

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:59,880
every cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone kiosk has the ability</font>

289
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:03,780
to generate a an SMS card with a phony

290
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,180
with a phony telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number so that</font>

291
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:11,040
the the the

292
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,149
validation message that came by through

293
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,498
your phone could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be actually be diverted</font>

294
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,720
to somebody else's phone so there's so

295
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:17,699
many insecurities that with that that

296
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,869
that which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually one of the</font>

297
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,279
things that actually starting to work

298
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:23,610
people are getting used to using your

299
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,309
phone's their phones as a authenticator

300
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,069
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's that's like too</font>

301
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,639
dangerous and I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> also point out that</font>

302
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">when without secure password stores then</font>

303
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,649
to factor if you know if you it's if you

304
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,209
have a leg that's on or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

305
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,949
standing on two legs and cut down one

306
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:44,128
leg you only have what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have one</font>

307
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">leg without without a secure password</font>

308
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:51,720
surge to factor becomes one factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

309
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:55,259
so that brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to what is rock salt</font>

310
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,240
and it's somewhat similar to salted

311
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:03,149
hashing or key hashing but it uses

312
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my invention</font>

313
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:09,629
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call very large key cryptography</font>

314
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,839
and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large creature and I use very</font>

315
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:15,240
large key cryptography to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transform the</font>

316
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,009
salt and when doing so I make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

317
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,459
that's hard to steal and makes physical

318
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:24,839
security feasible let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

319
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,339
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLK concept means and the idea here</font>

320
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to have a key that is actually much</font>

321
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,529
larger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the expected volume of data</font>

322
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,079
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be encrypted at first</font>

323
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,660
that seems like crazy right I mean if

324
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,459
you have this little equation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

325
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,800
cipher keys are much smaller than

326
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,018
one-time pads which in turn are much

327
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,420
smaller than very large keys you know it

328
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,059
seems paradoxical one-time pad is enough

329
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,279
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have enough key bytes to</font>

330
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,649
encrypt every single character

331
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,990
separately what's the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to going</font>

332
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:58,279
beyond that and the answer is there are

333
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,600
there are in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> some advantages to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

334
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,910
one of which is you can get provable

335
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,899
security and I can get that I think it's

336
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be beyond the point of it</font>

337
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,949
beyond the scope of this talk but it's

338
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,240
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to see why but the most</font>

339
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,790
important thing for this talk is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

340
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,730
some you get a macroscopic key a

341
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,910
macroscopic secret a secret that is

342
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,100
actually physically big okay and that

343
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,069
means it can be physically defended

344
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:28,050
and short leaks of that key if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

345
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:30,089
it properly or inconsequential<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

346
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,620
very large key would be random or

347
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,620
possibly pseudo-random that's a whole

348
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,680
other discussion it can be many

349
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,579
terabytes multiple solid-state disk

350
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,969
modules and compare this of ordinary

351
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,699
keys which can literally fit on t-shirts

352
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:52,279
and have in the past that's the that's a

353
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:54,899
complete program<font color="#E5E5E5"> for decrypting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dvds and</font>

354
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,519
of course the whole side channel problem

355
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:01,470
where you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

356
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:04,199
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few dozen bites it's very easy to not</font>

357
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:07,740
easy but it's very feasible to monitor

358
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,000
power usage or monitor radio frequency

359
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,160
gamma nations or a whole bunch of

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting keys that are</font>

being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used over and over and over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

362
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,649
one example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wear of for that</font>

363
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:22,079
somewhat parallel to very large key

364
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,509
cryptography is deniable cryptographic

365
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,810
file systems where you basically fill a

366
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:32,790
disk with random stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when you</font>

367
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:34,290
write Oh they'd into that disk you do it

368
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,639
in an encrypted way and hopefully if the

369
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,000
encryption system is indistinguishable

370
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">from pure random data no be looking at</font>

371
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk can tell what's what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

372
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what's what's nonsense so that and</font>

373
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,819
the point there being that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

374
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:51,389
reveal part of what's there without

375
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:55,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">revealing all of it but so far that's</font>

376
00:16:51,389 --> 00:17:00,269
the only precedent for what I'm talking

377
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,470
about that I know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go</font>

378
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of the details</font>

379
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,270
and it's not complicated at all really

380
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,500
once you once you get past this point

381
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:14,490
normal password verification using salt

382
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:17,250
you you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the salt and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look up</font>

383
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,799
the the using the username<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a key you</font>

384
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,099
look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> their stored hash and salt in a</font>

385
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:25,770
database you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash the password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

386
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">submitted with that salt does that match</font>

387
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,658
the store the stored hash if yes you're

388
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,870
in if not you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in okay everybody's</font>

389
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:36,830
familiar this I hope at this point

390
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,510
ok rock salt is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that different again</font>

391
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,370
you look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stored hash and salt in</font>

392
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the database tonight let me just go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

393
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,169
a second here obviously there's another

394
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,790
step here when you which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

395
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,440
illustrating here but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

396
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward which is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you first set up</font>

397
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,160
the account of course you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

398
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,850
password your hash it and they put with

399
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,680
a you generate a random salt you hash

400
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,010
the password with that random<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sultan and</font>

401
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:05,030
that's what gets stored away in the

402
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,500
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok for rock salt the main</font>

403
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,320
difference is you still look up the

404
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,900
store hash and salt you send the salt to

405
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,760
the rock salt server the rock salt

406
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,750
survey uses the salt as a seed for a

407
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,330
deterministic random number generator

408
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,000
preferably cryptographically strong that

409
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:27,110
picks out some number of bytes you know

410
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,240
enough versa say 64 bits or whatever

411
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,409
whatever is an engineering trade-offs

412
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,120
there but basically nothing much

413
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,020
different from ordinary salt you

414
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,809
assemble those bytes return it to the

415
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:42,530
password server as the rock salt and the

416
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:44,270
rock salt then the server does a hash of

417
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,000
that trial password with the rock salt

418
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:51,050
if it matches the stored hash great<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little database symbol down there</font>

with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> file photos that's just</font>

436
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,540
the ordinary corporate database I'm not

doing anything different to protect

439
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,600
protect it if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as I point</font>

441
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,260
only thing that's being protected here

442
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,840
is this very large key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is literally</font>

443
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,850
stored in a safe and and the left there

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my little sketches of how</font>

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:07,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would work the solid-state memories</font>

446
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,939
would be put into little modules that

447
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,790
might actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyed to make it hard</font>

448
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,220
to some interlocks would make it hard to

449
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,710
not impossible just hard slow down

450
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,810
anybody who got physical access from

451
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,360
trying to copy what's in that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

453
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,389
the safe and again once you have

<font color="#E5E5E5">something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is physically large</font>

Faraday cage to minimize any stray

459
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,990
radiation you can attach alarm system to

460
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,710
this one of the things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rocks all secret is static so</font>

462

periodic maintenance the only reason to

464
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,240

466
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,560
the modules so you can lock things in a

you know nuclear weapons launches where

this system is long enough that

hopefully somebody would would

physically interrupt the process you

electronic communication with this very

513
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,399
large key is to use a data garden right

514
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,720
data guard basically this is a

515
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,700
microprocessor or even a an ASIC or FPGA

516
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,980
that's just designed to pass only

517
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain messages and at a rate limited</font>

518
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:09,580
level because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data traffic</font>

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,520
required for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day to date on going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minute by minute password verification</font>

521
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,310
is much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the data rate needed</font>

522
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:23,470
to exfiltrate a cig nuff of that very

large key to cause damage these data

524
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,770
guards can be made they won't have you

525
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,350
don't need an operating system it can be

526
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,270
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple easily audited software</font>

527
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,189
there's a lot of I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can now</font>

528
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,650
actually get stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take</font>

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Haskell code and and translate it into</font>

533
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,870
a series of different guards along the

way one want some<font color="#E5E5E5"> with just limit the</font>

537
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:01,090
see if the things come under<font color="#CCCCCC"> other kinds</font>

538
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:03,219
of attack the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative the major I'll</font>

539
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,540
turn that I'm aware of is creating a

540
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,130
separate database password verification

541
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,570
somebody asked me a question on on the

542
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,649
peerless system by the

543
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:16,689
name is 1337 mark is this I'm we talking

544
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:19,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a secure Enclave for the for the</font>

545
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,789
passwords and the problem with that is

546
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:25,299
it it complicates back of it and

547
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:27,340
synchronization of databases large

548
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:30,129
enterprises may need to have more than

549
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:34,379
one server and more than one password

550
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:37,840
database to allow multi continent

551
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,679
operation of there<font color="#CCCCCC"> o their business all</font>

552
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,220
that synchronization places more<font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

555
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,590
compromise can cause compromises ok so

556
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">again that the big advantage of this is</font>

557
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,730
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have from the users perspective</font>

558
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,080
is that you know we're back to passwords

559
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,210
that are short enough that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

560
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,620
people are comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you</font>

561
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,120
still obviously have to limit or

562
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:12,939
throttle fail login attempt so that a

563
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,830

<font color="#E5E5E5">require any new any changes to existing</font>

568
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,908
practice the only thing you really have

569
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,879
to avoid is obvious passwords something

570
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:36,389
you can get from the facebook account or

571

575
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,508
that used to be handed out but they'd

576
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,120
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a little card and there'd be</font>

like a little your password on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font>

for this kind of thing even ba ba ba

would be fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so potential attacks</font>

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,649
obvious one physical security violation

583
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:11,379
and the use of alarm systems and

584
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:14,229
monitoring systems again since this

585
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:16,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't require anybody to access the</font>

system on a normal basis one can be

587
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:23,430
fairly strict in in terms of using

588
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,600
secure

589
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:29,950
practices that are that are standard in

590

industry not one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that simply sitting inside the corporate</font>

and you know accumulate them and

exfiltrate those out I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

keeping track of how many requests and

602
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,139
so on maybe even add some<font color="#E5E5E5"> canary</font>

passwords that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not normally be</font>

accessed the the the basic thing to

605
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,920
think about is that really if the

606
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">software that's actually doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past</font>

we're checking can be compromised it's

608
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,950
all the attacker has to do is get the

609
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,130
passwords that as their entered so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

610
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,840
have to assume for for any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

611
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,750
system that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at least some</font>

612
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,699
integrity and the actual password

613
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:36,160
verification software itself again easy

614
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:40,840
guess passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had put down using</font>

615
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,250
dictionaries to prevent to eat prevent

616
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,230
users from selecting passwords that are

617
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,760
too obvious actually it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an</font>

618
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,200
interesting comment made earlier that

619
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually may be counterproductive</font>

620
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,530
because when when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I when so many</font>

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,090
types in rumple's skills<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumpelstiltskin</font>

as their password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets rejected</font>

623
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,230
they'll just type in Normal School some

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rumplestiltskin one and that actually</font>

625
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:09,510
creates a set of passwords that are you

626
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:12,010
know good ones to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying but again</font>

627
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,379
there may be some training required here

628
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,550
or actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be may be desirable</font>

629
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,680
not to look at the dictionary

630
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,600
necessarily but look at things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

631
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,340
already know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user so that for</font>

632
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,439
example they don't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> their username</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

633
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,919
the company's name or their personal

634
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,270
name as as the as their password but

635
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is again it's a much easier much</font>

636
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:36,310
easier challenge in terms of training

637
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,230
people to just get them

638
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,659
to not use things that really closely

639
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,960
that somebody can easily guess about

640
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:46,540
them and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course any password system</font>

641
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,880
is vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of attacks so</font>

642
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,250
summing up the advantages of rock salt

643
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's dependable it's engineered it can</font>

644
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,740
be proven for its security can be proven

645
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,290
from first principles it eliminates the

646
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:02,190
arms race because attackers don't get

647
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,659
the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to do offline</font>

648
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,390
password guessing even if they get hold

649
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,980
of the database it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even quantum</font>

650
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:13,390
computing resistant less burden on users

651
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,550
the changes to existing password

652
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,470
management practices are very small you

653
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">one has to set up this communication</font>

654
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,410
link and probably have some some field

655
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,920
in the database that that tells you rock

656
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:29,020
salt is enabled but that's about it and

657
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,000
again the password data itself the

658
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,830
verification data is just becomes part

659
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,840
of the ordinary corporate database it

660
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,939
can be backed up it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be handled no</font>

661
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,709
differently from any other user account

662
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,150
information the transition is easy I

663
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:44,920
thought about how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to fall if</font>

664
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,550
people try this and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

665
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,350
coming up a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fall back to an older</font>

666
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,520
systems if necessary I think there's a

667
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:57,399
conference in it confidence-building

668
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,129
step required here but the bottom line

669
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,960
is a lot less risk and liability for the

670
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise and of course a lot less</font>

671
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,290
burden on users limitations it's too

672
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,800
cumbersome I think for smaller personal

673
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:15,280
operations again using key derivation

674
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,440
functions it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the best bet for</font>

675
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,850
that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution as they said</font>

676
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
earlier for passwords that he used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

677
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:25,689
draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or cryptographic key you can't</font>

678
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,550
use password hashes as a credential to

679
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,500
sheriff or other organizations or other

680
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:34,840
parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization and that's not</font>

681
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:37,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good idea anyway business problems you</font>

682
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,280
know obviously this is a new idea

683
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,740
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to try it will be</font>

684
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,970
interesting there are a lot of questions

685
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:48,370
there but that's another discussion

686
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,169
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not</font>

687
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,268
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most elegant solution</font>

688
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:54,519
the idea of having building this you

689
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,169
know terabytes and terabytes of

690
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,200
information just to protect passwords

691
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:02,259
seems clumsy but I believe it works

692
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,470
nothing else does and this if you those

693
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">who remember raiders of the lost ark</font>

694
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:13,419
might remember this particular scene ok

695
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:23,738
any questions I don't think darling

696
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:26,049
questions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can ask mats ok so this</font>

697
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:28,330
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like has luff similarities to a</font>

698
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:31,059
blind hashing by tap link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially having a very large hash</font>

701

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,609
the hashing process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I haven't</font>

703
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:44,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen it I should look at for it ok cool</font>

704
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,639
thanks

705
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,050
this is probably just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own brain fart</font>

706
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,920
because you definitely went into detail

707
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:01,480
but why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um how is the RSS</font>

708
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,340
server able to verify all these

709
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,100
passwords if the trusted module is

710
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,649
stored separately and securely right

711
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">although all the RSS server does that</font>

712
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:14,410
this is a good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> all need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

713
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,960
bring it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the little picture all</font>

714
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:19,750
the RSS server does is effectively

715
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,330
create a way of transforming the hash

716
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,820
that was stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the database to a</font>

different sorry the salt that was stored

721
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,590
that an outside attacker has no way of

722
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,940
knowing what thats all value is so even

723
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,310
though they get the salt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in the</font>

724
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,980
database they can't use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

725
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:52,240
calculate the hash that's stored in the

726
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:54,550
database I mean I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it is i'm</font>

727
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">not sure what is the difference here the</font>

728
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference here only is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by using a</font>

729
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:02,460
very large key you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend this</font>

730
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:05,440
process that's that's the novelty a

731
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,530
keyed hash will do this right but a

732
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,550
keyed hash you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 128-bit</font>

733
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,970
or 256-bit key in that hash you have no

734
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:18,340
you may be using a hardware security man

735
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,500
module maybe somebody develops a new so

736
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,510
I channel attacks of that module there

737
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,420
you know it's a single point it's a very

738
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:28,750
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fragile single point of failure the</font>

739
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,580
diff the novelty here is using this very

740
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:40,270
large key<font color="#E5E5E5"> King go back one frame or</font>

741
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:43,570
slide so is that accurate I think so

742
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:46,080
maybe if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I so there's a salt in the</font>

743
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:49,360
database right then you take that salt

744
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,699
give it to the rock salt server right it

745
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,310
returns assault for you and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> change a</font>

746
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,860
different value yeah and then you hash

747
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,620
that yeah so what's stopping someone

748
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,679
from getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server grabbing</font>

749
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,500
all the salts requesting the rocks out

750
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,630
server for all of those right and I

751
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that earlier and I that that</font>

752
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:13,360
is that museum to get down to that the

753
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,550
main the main thing is a to use a data

754
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,129
guard that limits the rate at which you

755
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,899
do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then also maybe has</font>

756
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,370
statistical tests that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font>

757
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,730
everybody's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to be a large</font>

758
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,949
number of I believe you can get the

759
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:30,100
statistical patterns for what normal

760
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:33,428
access is and to distinguish between a

761
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,330
systematic search but yes that and then

762
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:39,820
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other point is that in</font>

763
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,770
this in this whole system I'm assuming

764
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,679
that the the server that is actually

765
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,759
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password who knows what when</font>

766
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:51,310
you attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in a password field</font>

767
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,280
gets sent to some server somewhere that

768
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,230
server then then tells the rest of them

769
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,380
yep that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or no it's not okay</font>

770
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,390
right if that server it can be

771
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,970
compromised you don't have to do

772
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:06,400
anything more fancy than save all the

773
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,500
passwords to get type dinner so we have

774
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,090
to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the ability to</font>

775
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,920
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that server reliable that has to be</font>

776
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,720
trustworthy because if it isn't

777
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,100
trustworthy like I say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just grab the</font>

778
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,439
passwords directly why bother if

779
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,080
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so if you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

780
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,270
you can make that reliable that becomes

781
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing that has the ability to</font>

782
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,650
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rocks all server it has a</font>

783
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,920
secure link so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocks all server is</font>

784
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,750
looking for looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign messages</font>

785
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,900
from it whatever yeah there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety</font>

786
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways you can secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that link but the</font>

787
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,260
idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that link secure so that</font>

788
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,580
it's not easy for somebody to infiltrate

789
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,840
software and and then do exactly what

790
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:52,509
you're saying but that that of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course is</font>

791
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:55,870
is the truck that has to be prevented so

792
00:35:52,510 --> 00:36:00,160
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your big win here</font>

793
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:01,900
is that you're protecting from the

794
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,790
particular attack like offline attacks

795
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,800
so like somebody can't just get to the

796
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">database and then do as many offline tax</font>

797
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,990
with as many like GPUs as they possibly

798
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,759
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have a bunch of</font>

799
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,549
the same problems that existing systems

800
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,650
do but you've really locked down the

801
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,960
offline

802
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,490
my attacks but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here earlier I</font>

803
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,539
mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of practice</font>

804
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:27,200
driving everybody crazy you know the the

805
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:29,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the I know if you heard the keynote but</font>

806
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,379
the young woman who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is speaking was</font>

807
00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:37,319
talking about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that you</font>

808
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">know large numbers of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

809
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:43,079
with the requirements for people to

810
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,509
change passwords they're using closely

811
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,549
related passwords so once you get their

812
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,140
password or one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples that</font>

813
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:51,480
password you can figure out their whole

814
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,750
practice and maybe try it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on other</font>

815
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,180
systems you know the whole thing becomes

816
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:02,520
an arms race in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arms race is not in</font>

817
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:04,529
the favor of people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend so</font>

818
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,750
it sounds like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

819
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,400
between what you're doing I mean they're

820
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,859
they're obviously some mathematical

821
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,559
differences between what you're doing

822
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:17,609
and the and the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a key to H</font>

823
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:19,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">back on the hash but aside from that the</font>

824
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,779
it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the the fundamental</font>

825
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,670
difference here is that the secret that

826
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:25,950
you're using is fundamentally larger

827
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:31,230
than the secret that might necessarily

828
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:32,669
be used in an insane<font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM for doing an H</font>

829
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac is that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that correct that's</font>

830
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,420
correct that's exactly that's exactly

831
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,930
correct so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically your assertion here</font>

832
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:42,539
is that it's easier to protect a big key

833
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:46,710
than it is to protect a smaller key yes

834
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:49,020
and I guess I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept that that's</font>

835
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,250
necessarily the case I mean a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

836
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're talking about doing</font>

837
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,539
here in terms of protecting the rock

838
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,440
salt server are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do</font>

839
00:37:54,539 --> 00:38:01,049
just as easily on an HSM to protect the

840
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">H Mac process right but how again how</font>

841
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:05,640
would you for example it take for

842
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,619
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question of side-channel</font>

843
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:13,730
attacks of an HSM you could get if

844
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,420
somebody came into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the facility set up a</font>

845
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:19,289
monitoring thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

846
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,849
cleaning person or whatever got the you

847
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:24,240
know we're talking about 32 bytes of

848
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:26,119
data here<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no way you could have</font>

849
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,368
any confidence that that never happened

850
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:30,240
whereas with this you have some it's an

851
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:33,060
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you had</font>

852
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,669
some engineering ability to say you know

00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the amount of data is I know</font>

855
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,090
read out very quickly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

858
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,400
engineering solution that says I at

859
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,330
least have the ability to get some

860
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,530
conference I can review my monitoring

861
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,980
tapes I can do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

862
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:01,050
to say that that data has not been

863
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:05,400
stolen some confidence whereas with an

864
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:07,020
HSM maybe well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just leave it and</font>

865
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,820
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think there are ways to</font>

866
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,700
protect against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side channel attacks</font>

867
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and h SMS as well the other the other</font>

868
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,970
part of this though is unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> I missed</font>

869
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,550
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't say anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

870
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:19,799
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the salt that that you were</font>

871
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:23,130
using here because I in the in the other

872
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,110
case we had a I think perhaps a 32 bit

873
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,540
salt which is enough in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

874
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,550
essentially solve the deduplication

875
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,200
problem here you're asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

876
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:34,020
additional level of security from it

877
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,060
that would require a much longer salt I

878
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,750
presume well III didn't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

879
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,859
can the short answer is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

880
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,480
couple things you want to do one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

881
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:47,130
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a couple of engineering</font>

882
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:50,970
trade-offs you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's assault at 64</font>

883
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:52,590
bit on the 28 bits is not great expense

884
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:57,029
in terms of databases and stuff like

885
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,320
that the and then the rocks all started

886
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,030
not even the question of<font color="#CCCCCC"> databases in</font>

887
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,950
terms of transmitting data back and

888
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,470
forth and I there's there's actually a

889
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,710
bunch of trade-offs like I've considered

890
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,750
here but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons you wanted a</font>

891
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,790
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit bigger is there's all I</font>

892
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:15,270
mentioned that small amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

893
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:17,340
leak from the very large key don't do

894
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:21,060
damage the reason they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do damage</font>

895
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,980
is that probability would be might get

896
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,799
one or two or three bites so you want to

897
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:29,010
have the salt large enough so that one

898
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,320
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or three bites being compromised</font>

899
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,560
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce its efficiency but it's</font>

900
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,020
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge increase in size and</font>

901
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,230
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> other options here to</font>

902
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,599
one of which is actually set a different

903
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,809
mode which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about my paper it</font>

904
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:49,289
is sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rock salt</font>

905
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:54,289
server and have it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hash letting</font>

906
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:57,359
an assault and letting the past the

907
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:59,190
rocks all server do all the calculation

908
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,799
then just only<font color="#E5E5E5"> send back a single bit</font>

909
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,049
which says yes or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that that would</font>

910
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:06,150
even further reduce the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

911
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:09,720
that could leak out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

912
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,239
server but these these are engineering

913
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,339
trade-offs but they're not they're not

914
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:18,019
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion they're not that difficult</font>

915
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:20,130
of dramatic so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the previous slide is there any security</font>

concerns about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that random number</font>

919
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,140
generator that would you would have to

920
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:29,789
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about specifically with this</font>

921
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,950
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have a very large key</font>

922
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:35,479
and you're trying to prevent

923
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:39,739
exfiltration of even of a smaller key um

924
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:43,890
all the all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tri mean really any</font>

925
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:45,930
decent deterministic random generator

926
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,029
will do the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on</font>

927
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,249
you're sending the salt which is becomes

928
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:52,170
the key the sea for that deterministic

929

random<font color="#E5E5E5"> number generator that is going to</font>

930
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:59,729
pick out 32<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 64 bytes out of the this</font>

931
00:41:56,279 --> 00:42:01,829
entire 100 terabyte<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten terabyte</font>

932
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:06,029
whatever memory and then those those

00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">though those that string of vice will be</font>

934
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:11,759
the rock salt so the secrecy is simply

935
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,098
the fact that the attacker has no idea

936
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:16,829
what's in that very large key and in

937
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:19,739
fact you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then begin to do spaces</font>

938
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:22,410
statistics given the volume of users and

939
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:25,170
what is the probability of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of any</font>

940
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,210
one byte being used even twice and you

941
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:30,239
can make that relatively small so that

942
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,249
in reality the vast majority of bytes

943
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,710
that make up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that key will never have</font>

944

been seen before so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really</font>

945
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:41,239
with a security chemistry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think</font>

00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll stop it there will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be around</font>

afterwards as well outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

948
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:48,089
hallway so now we'll do our short break

949
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:51,089
until three o'clock and next speaker up
