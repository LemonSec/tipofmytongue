1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
here we go all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,649
for coming this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an awesome room we</font>

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,570
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually born here at bsides Las</font>

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,170
Vegas exactly three years ago yesterday

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,820
so we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that in a minute but</font>

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's besides has really been integral to</font>

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,410
getting us launched and getting this

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,670
kind of silly experiment off the ground

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm Josh Corman i'm one of the founders

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,269
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'ma cavalry I'm Bo woods I'm a</font>

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,400
another person<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have to cover bo</font>

12
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,369
doesn't may or may not tell this story

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,290
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> bo actually competed with our reveal</font>

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,880
so while Nick<font color="#E5E5E5"> rococo and I were</font>

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,500
presenting the revealed I am the cavalry

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,239
and asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys to join us on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,070
crazy mission but was actually

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,649
presenting a different track here and

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,390
never even<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw it but we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,300
bo is our first and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our best</font>

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,710
recruits because we met over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese</font>

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,828
whiskey in the speaker room immediately

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,590
after and he's been incredibly committed

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:59,460
and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how committed throughout</font>

25
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,289
the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font>

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,510
really quickly how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are brand</font>

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,630
new to the cavalry or versus how much

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,929
can I assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll split the</font>

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,420
difference a little bit here really

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,040
quickly we just turned three years old

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,360
yesterday so we're going to explain a

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,210
little bit of what's happened over this

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,840
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years of experimentation</font>

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,339
there are certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are</font>

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,540
working incredibly well and you're going

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,950
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them throughout the day you will</font>

37
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,150
see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring to bear from government from</font>

39
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,250
safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical industries and the kind</font>

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,780
of success stories that give us energy

41
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:34,590
and encouragement in the face of some

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,729
really really hard problems the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">months have been particularly</font>

44
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,509
challenging even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we're getting</font>

45
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,329
better we're getting a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse faster</font>

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,310
so bo and I are going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

47
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,898
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened that</font>

48
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,090
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious to everybody in fact</font>

49
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm shocked how very few hackers know

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,590
some of these stories we're going to

51
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,659
share but also they really compelled<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

52
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,719
catalyze some pretty big changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,070
we've made personally in that we think

54
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,559
are necessary for this mission to

55
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,419
continue and then I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about terraforming but I'm not going to</font>

57
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,479
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take all the oxygen out of the</font>

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole two days that we have we have an</font>

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,449
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> line-up for two days and you're</font>

60
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,339
going to see what's happening in

61
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,450
automotive cyber safety you're going to

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,680
see what's happening in medical cyber

63
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,170
safety

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,670
you're going to see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

65
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,708
fruits of working with government from

66

<font color="#E5E5E5">jen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ellis and a whole bunch of folks on</font>

67
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,799
where we're working to preserve

68
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,290
researcher rights to change the way you

government<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks at our kind and to try</font>

70
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,388
to drive safer out come sooner then

71
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,310
tomorrow just to frame a little bit

72
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:34,019
tomorrow is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really different so it may</font>

73
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,030
be unclear what it is on the schedule

74
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,329
but today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about where we're</font>

75
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,480
winning and where things look promising

76
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,980
tomorrow is really really really hard

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,439
problems that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have solutions</font>

78
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,418
for and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very honest</font>

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,769
and candid with each other in fact we'll

80
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,919
probably shut off the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> for large</font>

81
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:55,019
chunks of it one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those speakers later</font>

82
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,989
today is with me on the Health and Human

83
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,849
Services secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity task force</font>

84
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Congress asked for and the closer</font>

85
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,899
we look at clinical medical environments

86
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,790
the scarier it gets it's not funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

87
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,439
funny at all and there's really no

88
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,418
obvious solution so tomorrow morning

89
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,299
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to tackle really</font>

90
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:15,900
uncomfortable truths in medical in oil

91
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,760
and gas in agricultural technology to

92
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,199
try to surface in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the afternoon maybe</font>

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,328
some uncomfortable and unnatural

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,879
responses that we can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> innovated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

95
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,109
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> response to those all</font>

96
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,228
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's dive in so a little bit</font>

97
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">of celebration I didn't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing</font>

98
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,159
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to last three weeks or three</font>

99
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,810
months but ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just turned</font>

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:41,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">three on august first which was</font>

101
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:43,049
yesterday and you guys have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing</font>

102
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,939
and it's not going to be for everybody

103
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,159
and our fight isn't necessarily your

104
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,780
fight but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of trying new things</font>

105
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">and trying to get outside the echo</font>

106
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,810
chamber on things that matter and have

107
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,970
consequence it just felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

108
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,009
ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and we were ready to take</font>

109
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,659
the next step in our own evolution and

110
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,458
essentially for those you that were here

111
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,019
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we said is that you know I looked</font>

112
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,699
high and low in the government Nick

113
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,650

114
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,879
spiderlabs and we kept trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

115
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,889
for the adults in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room we kept</font>

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out who can we find that</font>

117
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,129
cares about these public safety human

118

life kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues you know we're all</font>

119
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,269
focused on credit card protection we're

120
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,089
all focused on privacy we're all focused

121
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,250
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that matter on their own but</font>

122
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,479
in the greater context our belief when

123
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,680
we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the Internet of Things is</font>

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,359
the unifying statement we made

125
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,729
was our dependence on connected

126
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,310
technology is growing faster than our

127
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:36,008
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure it in areas affecting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">public safety in human life so we've got</font>

129
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,830
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pithy or since then and now we</font>

130
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,320
point out it's where bits and bytes meet

131
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,030
flesh and blood but as we add software

132
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,889
two things we make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak and as we</font>

133
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,020
had connectivity to everything else we

isn't coming the natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequence we</font>

137
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,448
said is it falls to you to fill that

<font color="#CCCCCC">Katie i wasn't jan alice or space frog</font>

141
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,550
we had a group of folks that really

wanted to get moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your</font>

to end up using words like cyber when

you talk outside the echo chamber and I

you go to an auto company that's been

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,650
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from Alan Freedman</font>

from the US Commerce Department he's

policies for Kourtney and

203
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,010
vulnerabilities closures and when we do

the working groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on the safety</font>

them or entrap them and when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font>

understand why would white hats even

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,980
wanna hack an insulin pump why would

217
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,159
they care about a bedside infusion pump

218
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,970
and while many of us kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of know this I</font>

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this into your</font>

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,090
important for a dozens of other use

222
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,430
cases later I essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked people i</font>

223
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,549
meet why do you hack what got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you into</font>

224
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,740
hacking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i find that most of us major</font>

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,469
though just to outline what these are I

228
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,970
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's protectors who want to</font>

they don't superpowers they use their

hacking as their superpower right number

238
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,039
it's the curiosity right you know if

239
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,030
we're criminals if there's any crime

240
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,420
we're committing it's the crime of

241

curiosity right so protectors want to

also as many of you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> experienced we</font>

00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">get fewer bugs that might be easier to</font>

290
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,170
help you build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> muscles you might</font>

291
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,910
get your feet underneath you you might

292
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,319
see how many bugs with type of bugs

293
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,290
before you open the floodgates to

294
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,969
everybody else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes cavalry</font>

295
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,500
takes a stand on something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">little confusing like why wouldn't you</font>

297
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,560
pay researchers we're not against paying

298
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,319
researchers in fact some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

299
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,339
organizations like GM who came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

300
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:32,130
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerability disclosure</font>

302
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,569
because not because they're cheap but

303
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had no cash prize because they</font>

304
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,240
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what kind of bugs what</font>

305
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:41,009
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of volume and they're perfectly</font>

306
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,420
willing to pay very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

307
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:47,759

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,349

309
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,000
started off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with no cash prize than they</font>

310
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,439
added a small cash prize and a Def Con

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,029
last year they opted to ten thousand

312
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,589
dollars so you'll see these kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

313
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,769
things happen and while this isn't

314
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,870
exclusively about bug bounty programs we

315
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,279
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to help the outside world</font>

316
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,680
understand who we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're coming</font>

317
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,790
from we've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a friendly your</font>

318
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,410
face in a more

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,990
writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> face by focusing them on the</font>

320
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,060
protectors and the puzzlers and for my

321
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,310
sake I'm first and foremost a protector

322
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,170
right I want to save lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to</font>

323
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,819
also like really tough problems so

324
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,949
that's why I choose the puzzler is my

325
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,690
second so whether this resonates with

326
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,160
you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not someone's gotten argue with</font>

327
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,850
me I said I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a sixth one we</font>

328
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be pedantic if we want they're not</font>

329
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,230
perfect they're not comprehensive but

330
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,180
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are fairly decent way to articulate</font>

331
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,800
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a domestic resource</font>

332
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,120
not a domestic threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so really</font>

333
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
quickly especially because we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

334
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,090
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a late start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

335
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting a lot of really great content</font>

336
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,230
throughout the day a few highlights of

337
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,600
what's worked over last four years one

338
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things we did and I had a lot of</font>

339
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,550
help from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this room</font>

340
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,350
was to make some sort of gesture to the

341
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,329
outside world so Nick<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rococo had done a</font>

342
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">TEDx he invited me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come help you one</font>

343
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,840
in Chicago so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen this</font>

344
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a good way for your neighbor or</font>

345
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,950
for your co-workers understand it i did

346
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,230
a TEDx called swimming with sharks for

347
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,300
and cyber safety and the Internet of

348
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,130
Things and without getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

349
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole metaphor here I went on a sharp</font>

350
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,120
die with days litchfield<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I realized</font>

351
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,380
how incredibly similar the Internet of

352
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,510
Things is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting in the water with</font>

353
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,610
apex predators and while most people

354
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,530
can't understand the jargon and the

355
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,140
gobbledygook they do get this and it's

356
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,850
been pretty effective but our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

357
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:30,300
big deliverable was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first</font>

358
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,030
birthday so two years ago yesterday at

359
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Def Con we launched a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 star automotive</font>

360
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,230
cyber safety framework for connected

361
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,790
vehicles and this was essentially our

362
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,890
olive branch to the automotive industry

363
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,110
to say look your masters of your domain

364
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,270
you've been making cars safer for a

365
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,950
hundred years but we're masters of our

366
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,480
domain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now that</font>

367
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,520
our domains of collided we will be safer

368
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,870
sooner if we work together and we

369
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought this would be not a pci</font>

370
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,580
framework or a checklist or an iso

371
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,010
standard but really just the admission

372
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,870
that all systems fail and here's five

373
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,390
basic foundational capabilities you need

374
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,890
towards failure now our belief was this

375
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,510
would give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to meet these people</font>

376
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,460
meet the entire ecosystem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

377
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,160
suppliers the insurer's the driver is

378
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the dealers and it did right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got to</font>

379
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in front of government folks we</font>

380
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,400
built relationships we had arguments we

381
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,560
were accused of being extortionists and

382
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initially but ultimately we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

383
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,349
been heavily embraced and you're going

384
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,470
to see some of the fruits of that later

385
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,760
today the sad part though is we thought

386
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,180
this five star would really be the

387
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,380
starting line<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that once all cars had</font>

388
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,079
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things then we can start doing</font>

389
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,570
real security on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

390
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,460
when there's a car<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the damage will</font>

391
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">be less the public fear and anxiety will</font>

392
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,960
be lesser the response times will be

393
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,270
compressed etc and it's been very very

394
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">good and I have a slide a little bit</font>

395
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,920
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shows what these five things</font>

396
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,720
are but essentially it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

397
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to framework to work with</font>

398
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,570
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different stakeholders put</font>

399
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,310
ourselves in the map and show<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

400
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,440
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to hack you know stuff on</font>

401
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,400
television and scare people were

402
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually gonna be part of the solution</font>

403
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,470
and it took a little while but it's

404
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:07,140
worked and we've been invited since then

405
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,360
to at least a dozen yeah automotive

406
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,610
conferences over the last two years

407
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">after we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that out we got a lot of</font>

408
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,470
responses in yeah so which were what the

409
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,110
hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing who are some of</font>

410
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,180
them are where I've been saying this

411
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,580
inside my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization for several</font>

412
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,719
years this gives me the external

413
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,060
ammunition to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take it to my</font>

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,100
executive stakeholders again and it will

415
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,530
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> move the ball forward right so</font>

416
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,570
it wasn't us pushing from the outside it

417
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">was us identifying people on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font>

418
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,130
who could then invite us in and to have

419
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,780
those dialogues yeah it's important to

420
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,630
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we got a lot of guff from even</font>

421
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,770
from our own community that this wasn't

422
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,210
comprehensive enough or needed more

423
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,470
things or we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have talked to you</font>

424
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">know bother</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to a single auto</font>

425
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,890
worker the truth is we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoken for</font>

426
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,420
nine months with most of the

427
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,890
stakeholders<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could find in the auto</font>

428
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,130
industry we talked to tier1 suppliers

429
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,600
OEM regulators people who were working

430
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,730

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,140

432
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,750
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of groundwork before we revealed it</font>

433
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,010
so part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ambassador job is finding</font>

willing allies and working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

435
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,060
that said it there's a lot more to do

436
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,100
one piece of encouragement is two

437
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,869
Fridays ago I was in Detroit for one of

438
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:20,730
these invited cyber security conferences

439
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:23,670
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of GM her keynote was highly</font>

440
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:27,120
similar to 1i had given on cyber safety

441
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,040
so we have successfully infected one of

442
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
the leaders<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that space and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by her</font>

443
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
taking that leadership stance and using

444
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,520
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our jargon</font>

445
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,990
like the importance of working with

446
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
third-party researchers by putting out a

447
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,310
welcome mat instead of it beware of dog

448
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,260
sign that's setting the tone for all of

449
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,430
her competitors and for the regulars as

450
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,450
well in fact we have the National

453
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,420
the panels similar in shape and spirit

455
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,050
because of the relationship we built

00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,430
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Food and Drug Administration we</font>

457
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,109
made a Hippocratic oath for connecting

462
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,330
cyber safety talk but the idea here was

463
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,609
that as physicians take a Hippocratic

464
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:16,160
oath to act in the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> interests of the</font>

465
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,320
patients increasingly medical devices

466
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,900
are the delivery mechanism for that

467
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,780
patient care so shouldn't those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

468
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,949
also have a similar type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethos and</font>

469
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,660
it's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mash-up of like</font>

470
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">democratic oath and isaac asimov's three</font>

471
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,900
laws that's right robotics so if you can

472
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,720
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it that way it would be very</font>

473
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,640
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear but subversively we also</font>

474
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,190
designed it so that each person within

475
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stakeholder ecosystem in that chain</font>

476
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,230
of care delivery can see themselves in

477
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:51,470
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> role in engaging on these</font>

478
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,920
topics so each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them can be read</font>

479
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,290
in a way that physician can say oh my

480
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">god that's my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a medical</font>

481
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">device maker can say that's my job too</font>

482
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so that a nurse and so that a</font>

483
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,290
hospital administrator so that a

<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare procurement officer buys the</font>

485
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,970
things can all see themselves reflected

486
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,459
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework it really changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

487
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,740
tone as well we revealed it at the FDA

488
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,329
they had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-day workshop and in the</font>

489
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,520
two days of panels I think we had a

490
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,909
cavalry person on every single panel at

491
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,740
least one it was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing but some</font>

492
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,199
guy got<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that we've never met before</font>

493
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,820
and said this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing we are all</font>

494
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,950
paper you know we all came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a health</font>

495
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,750
care delivery we want to save lives is

496
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,520
there a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> person in here who won't</font>

497
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,770
make this pledge right now he tried to

498
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,420
get everybody on camera to kind of you

499
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,610
know at least volunteer to this because

500
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's we share a similar zeitgeist in a</font>

501
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,240
similar motivational structure and that

502
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,890
they got into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they want to</font>

503
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,110
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> blog</font>

504
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,610
so we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they went from looking</font>

505
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,320
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security people is the ones that</font>

506
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,419
make it impossible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the crash</font>

507
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
cart when people are dying to saying

508
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,170
wait a second they can be a teammate

509
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,670
here so we kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the tone I'm</font>

510
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,550
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into this one a lot more</font>

511
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,280
tomorrow but just as a reveal we've been

512
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,000
using this probably since day one

513
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,870
informally when a safety-critical

514
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,760
industry wanted to understand how is IOT

515
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,469
different like how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> safety critical</font>

516
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
different than our traditional IT

517
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,430
security so I've had this framework of

518
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,830
six things and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to publish it</font>

519
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,930
after this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> after some we battle</font>

520
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,689
tested here amongst you a little bit

521
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,010
tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well but it's incredibly</font>

522
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,630
important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that you've</font>

523
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,280
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your cyber security career or in</font>

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,390
confidentiality of data keeping secrets

529
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,160
maybe some intellectual property but we

530
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">spent an awful lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time our best</font>

531
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">practices are really the sum of an</font>

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,620
equation that's focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

533
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,450
confidentiality of data things get

534
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,610
really really different when you start

535
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,620
talking about cyber physical impact loss

536
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,740
of life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and limb critical patient care</font>

537
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,439
delivery the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detect and respond</font>

538
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,760
breaks down immediately so some of us

539
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,620
grow into the term kill chain but we've

540
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,350
kind of resigned ourselves the fact that

541
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,060
we have to wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a failure notice</font>

542
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's sooner and respond but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

543
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,929
respond and undo dead patients like if

544
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,880
you had to push earlier into it not

545
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,550
indicators of compromise but indicators

546
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reconnaissance or indicators of</font>

547
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,840
tampering we don't have good answers for

548
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because we've resigned ourselves</font>

549
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,860
that breaches will happen they're going

550
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,630
to happen often and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just respond</font>

551
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,560
so one of the things I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind</font>

552
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,660
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're not necessarily facing a</font>

Russian mafia card scammer when we're

554
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,890
talking about a hospital so we have

555
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">different adversaries we have different</font>

556

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:48,510
of life measured in public confidence

558
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:51,220
measured in GDP hit we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

559

<font color="#E5E5E5">things operate you can't put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a perimeter</font>

anything like encrypted comms layers

576
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:26,140
there's different economics some of

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,789
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller IOT device price points</font>

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,350
are so low you'll never get a penny

579
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,360
spent on security they'll never have a

CISO they never pay for a pen tester

581
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,559
they won't have a coordinated closure

582
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,750
program inversely some of these really

583
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,178
big generators that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took a train to</font>

move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the facility before they built</font>

585
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,010
the facility that there's there's 30

586
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,440
million dollars and they're meant to

587
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,480
last for 30 plus years so the economics

588
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,880
are wildly different and then the time

589
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,679
scales like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said maybe up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 30 years</font>

590
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">like our cell phones are meant to last</font>

cars are durable goods that are meant to

594
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,899
gets old really quick so these guys are

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,899
grappling with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things again</font>

596
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:10,000
different adversaries mostly ideological

597
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,100
not so much rational different

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,740
consequences different context different

599
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,510
composition different economics and

600
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,120
different time scales so it'll become

601
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,590
clear tomorrow as we dive in but a lot

602
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,149
of our best practices and are a lot of

603
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,789
our conventional wisdom falls apart

604
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:26,379
really really fast if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were to stay</font>

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if the vendor won't fix the</font>

won't fix it until there's a disclosure

611

event here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem when you have a</font>

617
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,590
have that old cliché that security

through obscurity is no security<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font>

619
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,559
but what we keep encountering is

620
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,809
situations are where that's all we have

621
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,330
that's all we have and that's not

622
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,440
comforting but it is the truth so we're

623
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,139
going to dive into this a little bit

624
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,090
more tomorrow

625
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,100
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spend about as much time in the</font>

sure some people got divorced but you

know it didn't end the world we didnt

otice all of a sudden start making much

pretty devastating the people affected

649

but it has it triggered as it catalyzed

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,700
a massively different policy response an

651
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,870
answer is no and I think sadly we're

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,420
about to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> error of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

consequence failures so what I defining

654
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a high consequence failure is</font>

655
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,790
something that shatters the public

656
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,230
confidence and creates a crisis of

657
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,510
confidence in a key industry that will

658
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:34,060
have a loss of life an exotic loss of
