<font color="#CCCCCC">Philip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to give us a great talk</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,309
now plc for home automation and how to

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,340
make it a honeypot without further ado

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:20,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">please come in a little silently turn</font>

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:22,380
off your phones and enjoy hi hi works<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,970
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok first of all I would like</font>

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,448
to thank these guys for having me here

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,820
oops is that going and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,920
thank my manager Scott<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arvind from</font>

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,610
protiviti they have their boots just

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,170
outside still please check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,170
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everyone who's sitting in</font>

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,540
this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so today I'm going to talk</font>

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,079
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> plc for home automation and how to</font>

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,780
make it like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey pot um it may not</font>

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,110
be what you have imagined it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,059
how to crack a PL seen not about how to

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,570
how to break it because you know

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,739
trendmicro is not playing red team so

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:04,170
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about having fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so this is how</font>

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,320
how you might imagine about home

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,780
animation a like an open tab project

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,080
with raspberry<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi some neat modules that</font>

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can purchase on seeds or other</font>

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,840
online retail stores and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,159
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your mailbox checker your</font>

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,930
washing<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine on or yeah to monitor</font>

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,750
the temperature humidity of your house

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,729
but just a friend of mine has had this

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,990
idea of making it a little bit more

31
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,270
robust like using an industrial level

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,339
plc you can have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works</font>

33
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,259
for 20 years you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't even</font>

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,439
have to upgrade firmware and that's part

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,689
of the problem well and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just install</font>

36
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,520
and forget and it will run forever and

37
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:55,908
they even nowadays they even have some

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,520
interviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> ER interface it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ifttt</font>

39
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:03,509
very beautiful hm I so you don't even

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,780
need to take on a raspberry pi it's the

41
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,300
interface it's like this so if something

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,580
then something and you have if you have

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand a little bit how plc works</font>

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,230
for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,580
figure a timer that sends heartbeat

46
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:24,290
otherwise if someone just<font color="#CCCCCC"> d dot your poz</font>

47
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:27,090
you're dead so Pierce is just not like a

48
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,450
modern computer it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit weak I</font>

49
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,430
mean the CPU is weak so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if UD does it it</font>

50
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,480
stops to work and everything is gone and

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,540
there's no security anymore so this is

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house is designed as you</font>

53
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,269
enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> a house there's an ayah ir</font>

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,510
infrared sensor as the sensor is

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:52,380
activated within one minute you have to

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,370
push the key keyless key to unarm this

57
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,340
rolling code remote controller otherwise

58
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,880
there's a siren<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is a hundred DB with</font>

59
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,030
both very loud to alert everyone scare

60
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,420
your out sorry sorry for dirty

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,300
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then there thursday</font>

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,390
there's a rich switch on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main door</font>

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,640
so you cannot just come in and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

64
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,299
unlock pick lock the lock pick the door

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,940
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work it will the siren would</font>

66
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:29,550
was so it's how the bus looks like and

67
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,340
he's a freak he he has designed all this

68
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,620
circulates like a Modbus TCP GPRS with

69
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPS module so if anybody interested</font>

70
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,530
health there's a SMS sent to his cell

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,339
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's an external module</font>

72
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,730
that goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks rs-485 so he has</font>

73
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional digital</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ends and there are</font>

74
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,640
backup powers it's a double looped

75
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,130
powered sake<font color="#E5E5E5"> which so when anything</font>

76
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,149
fails on the main circuit there's a pack

77
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:05,609
of power powered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> UPS and this alarm</font>

78
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:08,610
16d<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that he is just having fun and he</font>

79
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:13,140
even kind of took tad bit and use a

80
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,780
heater and a backup alarm so the thing

81
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">is he has to configure timer to send</font>

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,320
heartbeat to this back alarm here if

83
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,440
there's no heartbeat within three

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,870
minutes there's another SMS will be sent

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,460
to his mobile phone

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,430
so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows something's wrong and just</font>

87
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">some peripherals petrol helicopter for</font>

88
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:41,220
example no that's just for fun so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:42,870
here's how things are wired well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

90
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,600
leave it to you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can download</font>

91
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,170
all the the slides and all the programs

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,090
in this talk on github<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

93
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sourced so we can check it out on</font>

94
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,070
yourself and you can probably try to

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:01,200
implement that with your Raspberry Pi

96
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:04,290
that's how i did it here knows my

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,280
pleasure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share everything yeah okay</font>

98
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so here's how to break into the house</font>

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,630
you yeah you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to trigger the</font>

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,940
IR sensor without<font color="#E5E5E5"> key lock bomb you open</font>

101
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> door without the key lock bones um</font>

102
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,700
you cut up AC power and there's ups and

103
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,640
you want to short circuit because it's

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,000
triggered by it it's a slow triggered so

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,640
you might want to grab something maybe

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,680
or you can hack into a VPN like send him

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,700
some pornography and get his IP address

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,230
hack into<font color="#E5E5E5"> his home router and sorry</font>

109
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,229
that's not what I want to talk about

110
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:44,390
today you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure</font>

111
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:48,750
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do every month so I</font>

112
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,900
yeah I know you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but mmm the</font>

113
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,770
thing is you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stop sending the</font>

114
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:01,919
heartbeat you have to be very careful

115
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:05,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">otherwise he knows it yep so um the only</font>

116
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:10,260
thing that might break this design is a

117
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,840
failed power rail on both powers and it

118
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,539
happened once so that's Murphy's Law

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,479
well what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be wrong will be wrong so</font>

120
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,640
and you cannot just smash and grab

121
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,090
because he has his he's really a

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:28,280
paranoid freak he has his wire wire mesh

123
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:32,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">class installed so maybe the robbers</font>

124
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,429
want to just go to next door<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font>

125
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">for his neighbor but yeah it's how it</font>

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,980
works or you might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break this a</font>

127
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,190
rolling code thing

128
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,800
with a that's that comes with a really

129
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,250
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> prng so you might want to follow</font>

130
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,870
some campers talk in Def Con 23 that's

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:57,620
last year it just record the wireless

132
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,980
radio signal and playback that might

133
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,850
work I haven't tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or just use a</font>

134
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:08,210
sewing heater to break his main<font color="#E5E5E5"> door and</font>

135
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:12,380
yeah that works very well so what's next

136
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:16,760
now we have a armed house we have a POC

137
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:21,590
that talks Modbus on port of 503 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:23,300
502 and like everybody knows so we can

139
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,989
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot what's</font>

140
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,070
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> first level hot pot it just copies the</font>

141
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:35,600
readings out of this plc and use some

142
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:40,159
like em you say open source library that

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,620
runs on Raspberry Pi to try to expose

144
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,800
itself on the internet so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:51,170
might find your<font color="#E5E5E5"> plc to show then if you</font>

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,790
went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session this afternoon</font>

147
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:58,520
there's a door key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showed in</font>

148
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:01,430
for exposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> POCs so maybe the bad guys</font>

149
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,710
might be interested by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plc exposed</font>

150
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,990
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and you just but it's a</font>

151
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,530
fake one you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just copied that real time</font>

152
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,720
value so it's updated every minute you

153
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,830
open a door something change the one you

154
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,260
close the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door or something chance to</font>

155
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:18,710
really zero so it's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like really</font>

156
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentic so the bad guy might think</font>

157
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,750
this is a real thing and he want to he

158
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,740
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change something that you</font>

159
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:33,380
can log so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture so</font>

160
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,530
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smith k wants to change some</font>

161
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,349
coils or some holding registers and feel

162
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,728
happy and I have even<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a web</font>

163
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,830
interface a very simple where the

164
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:47,870
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot call hmm I because</font>

165
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:50,090
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just flask on yeah so he might be</font>

166
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,050
caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> Smith k if everyone knows that's</font>

167
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,580
out of tough tough novel

168
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and we can make it the second level</font>

169
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">honeypot just by adding a little bit</font>

170
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:04,820
imagination it's a self-adaptive hot pot

171
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,210
and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> some some state changes</font>

172
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,810
in this in this ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose plz and</font>

173
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:16,070
you add<font color="#CCCCCC"> some delays to procrastinate</font>

174
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:19,060
this change or on for example something

175
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes in the holding register you just</font>

176
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,760
don't make a copy a direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> topkapi you</font>

177
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,120
put it on some polynomial function to

178
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,240
make it match the value slowly to make

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,320
it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and the good</font>

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

181
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,010
parameters and deploy this honey pot

182
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,290
worldwide out of the same ground truth

183
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:47,230
so eventually you can have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> hun paths</font>

184
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:51,650
100 honey pots that act differently yep

185
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,570
so and yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> python is really a simple</font>

186
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,079
script language that's really powerful

187
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:01,460
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also find a pseudo pump on to it</font>

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,980
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the architecture just some</font>

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,910
fuzzy function um this is how it looks

190
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">likes I have a live demo but</font>

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,709
unfortunately i don't have a POC at hand

192
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,540
I yeah limited by budget there's only

193
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:19,310
one plz and I cannot leave my friends

194
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:25,430
house unarmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> also so this is a very big</font>

195
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:28,760
copy I apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ok so um this</font>

196
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:32,739
co9 is a heartbeat pain you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

197
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:38,420
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> every man every second and if</font>

198
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trick some like flip the</font>

199
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:47,060
switch you can see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed</font>

200
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:49,040
here yeah or you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that readings</font>

201
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,869
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> helding registered changes</font>

202
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:57,849
little by little so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works</font>

203
00:10:52,870 --> 00:11:00,980
or just wire this<font color="#E5E5E5"> di with some coil and</font>

204
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,290
you said coil to enable a pseudo pump or

205
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,560
real pump if you want to make fun of

206
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:11,339
yourself yep

207
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,300
so things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um so recap of</font>

208
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:18,870
what's in this talk so we have a POC

209
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,270
securely fasten the house sorry we have

210
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,180
a house securely fastened by a poz with

211
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,850
a double loop circulate and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

212
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,010
it a simple level 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> P honey pot and we</font>

213
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,590
can make it a little bit complicated

214
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,220
second level honey pot and we can add

215
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:39,110
some simulated pump to the circulate

216
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:42,600
very easily and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the code here</font>

217
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,280
just download it for kit have fun and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

218
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,900
you want to send me some<font color="#E5E5E5"> PR I will be</font>

219
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:52,079
very grateful yeah so that's it you can

220
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,770
add me<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Twitter or fork the code or</font>

221
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,070
just write me I work for Trend Micro and

222
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:02,970
text remark or performing here and

223
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:05,700
here's some sorry I know I should not do

224
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:13,220
live demo because you see live demo

225
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:16,220
never works exception section<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep so um</font>

226
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,220
sorry

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're me for a second yep you see here</font>

228
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,920
the coil<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 is the heartbeat pain it</font>

229
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:33,190
changes every second and I have made a

230
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,520
raspberry pi that monitors the heartbeat

231
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,020
if anything's wrong if there's no

232
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,880
heartbeat within three seconds a

233
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,230
simplified version of the original one

234
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,620
and a red light turns on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font>

235
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and imitate a very bad imitate of the</font>

236
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:55,600
original thing and yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how to</font>

237
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,959
do things if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fork it you</font>

238
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:04,120
see the value stumped and something's

239
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:08,440
listening and oh ok so I know what's

240
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:14,620
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's something mysterious</font>

241
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:17,920
with raspberry pi just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have config for</font>

242
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:26,560
two more network and things should be

243
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:29,560
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok level one level two and HMI</font>

244
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,979
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a chat much I just</font>

247
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:43,050
reloading yep

248
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:48,660
yeah you should not do a live demo

249
00:13:49,800 --> 00:14:01,949
awesome ready for questions yeah and

250
00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:01,950
questions anybody

251
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,710
at to start experimenting with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PLC's</font>

252
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,290
would you recommend any particular

253
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,480
families or types or manufacturers or

254
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,420
protocols or anything like that um

255
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,140
actually we're using ICP desk just

256
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,420
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cheap it's like two</font>

257
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,090
hundred dollars or four hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

258
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,219
if you buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> two I had stock price but I</font>

259
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:31,570
believe you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something cheaper</font>

260
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:35,230
on ebay um please<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't try those demons</font>

261
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:39,190
once it's a super hardcore much more

262
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:42,310
expensive but it works thank you yes

263
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,700
please is there any interactivity to the

264
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,500
attacker or is it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

265
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,740
goes in and dies and gets logged are

266
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
they getting any feedback back to mm-hmm

267
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're interacting</font>

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,230
with an actual plc I guess hmm well you

269
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,020
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh actually I haven't</font>

270
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,230
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unto one month ago so there's</font>

271
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,870

274
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:20,950
recordings of sessions of people in the

275
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:26,760
machine in the honey pot um yes let's

276
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works so um</font>

277
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,580
besides

278
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:50,040
so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question I almost</font>

279
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:52,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgot this thing on so C swap coil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

280
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,099
you see someone has set the values and

281
00:15:52,829 --> 00:16:01,229
you can put this log on to elasticsearch

282
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:07,019
or any any any database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want so</font>

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:14,279
we record it yes else anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

284
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:18,680
questions going once going<font color="#CCCCCC"> twice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>
