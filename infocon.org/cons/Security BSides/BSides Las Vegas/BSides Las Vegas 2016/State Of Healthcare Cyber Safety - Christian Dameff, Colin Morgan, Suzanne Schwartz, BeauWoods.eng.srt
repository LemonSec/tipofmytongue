1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
okay so welcome this is the much talked

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,268
about medical device cyber security

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,980
cyber safety talk we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:16,770
few people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up here and and do</font>

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,380
things like we did in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last one but I</font>

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,660
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first kind of make a link to</font>

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,009
what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year so if anybody by</font>

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,720
show of hands just who was in the room

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,310
last year when we were doing these talks

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,160
and specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the medical device</font>

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,288
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the very back</font>

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't it was just two people I thought</font>

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,520
there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> more but maybe they weren't</font>

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,930
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tie some of those</font>

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,280
things off and follow up on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,250
things we talked about last year some

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,260
very cool surprising developments and

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,410
then over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past year more and more</font>

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,570
things have happened so unravel what

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,449
those are and then looking ahead what's

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,780
coming up and then we're going to get

22
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">four very very cool people up on stage</font>

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,820
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have Jay Radcliffe who is</font>

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher most of you know</font>

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,559
him if not you know his name at least

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,390
Suzanne Schwartz who has already talked

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us once today she'll come back and</font>

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,189
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> again Colin Morgan who is with</font>

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,679
Johnson<font color="#CCCCCC"> & Johnson he's done some really</font>

30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,899
really good things to help drive

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,229
cybersecurity into their processes and

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,710
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian dem f who is a rare</font>

33
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,710
unicorn he has both a DEFCON speaker and

34
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,360
a registered physician so he's one of

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,408
the very few people that I know who have

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,340
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those on their title so what's</font>

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,450
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last year specifically</font>

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,299
following up from some of the things we

39
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,170
heard last year well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out</font>

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as of last year and before this has</font>

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed the FDA does not have to</font>

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,149
recertify patches for medical devices

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,530
before they can be deployed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field</font>

the last hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to worry about that and</font>

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,560
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard there that you</font>

49
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,570
can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look it up for yourself if</font>

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,319
you don't believe it I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot</font>

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,599
of people falsely believe that you need

FDA Reese

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,730
certify your medical device before it's

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,950
published before it can be updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

56
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,920
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow up to on something that</font>

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,250
happened last year we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Draeger who's</font>

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,200
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> German medical device maker announced</font>

59
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,300
their commitment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a coordinated</font>

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,940
vulnerability disclosure for the first

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,800
time at bsides Las Vegas which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you know a major</font>

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,570
medical a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoohoo yes a major medical</font>

64
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,210
device maker came to us and said we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,209
to announce in your track first and that

66
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,130
was really really cool so since then

67
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,100
about a year on they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

68
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing up about a week or two later</font>

69
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,049
year on they've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> for vulnerability</font>

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,970
disclosures through this process so

71
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,190
we're a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of medical device makers say</font>

72
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,109
we can't do a coordinated vulnerability

73
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,430
disclosure process because we don't

74
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,660
won't know what to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

75
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,610
vulnerabilities they've gotten for which

76
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,190
is not an onslaught it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

77
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,459
overwhelming zero of these have been

78
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,770
extortion attempts so contrary to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

79
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,650
seemingly popular belief in some sectors

80
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,420
that all researchers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is try</font>

81
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get money out of you that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">case I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also point out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

83
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 12 hour turnaround time from when</font>

84
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,880
they get a report coming in to when the

85
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,560
researcher gets a report notification

86
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,329
back hey we got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,080
it thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sending it in that's</font>

88
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,040
really cool so of all the software

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,200
companies how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a 12 hour</font>

90
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,140
turnaround time to that notification

91
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,700
human-based notification not many so the

92
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">medical device makers and to the others</font>

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,500
who say well we just can't do that we

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,209
can't respond within 72 hours well

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,510
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it within 12 hours and</font>

96
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,760
that's with a team of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dedicated</font>

97
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,459
professionals working very hard to get

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,190
that done so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible and</font>

99
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">draeger's done great things so they're</font>

100
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,430
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching right now if they're</font>

101
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">not watching now the watch the recording</font>

102
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,989
so how about a round<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applause for</font>

103
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:25,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">Draeger</font>

104
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:27,549
i also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to follow up quickly on the</font>

105
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:32,080
Hesperian so what we talked earlier

106
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:36,009
today about hospira they had a medical

107
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,430
device an infusion pump that was it's

108
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,099
like a new fashion<font color="#CCCCCC"> new fangled IV it's a</font>

109
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer-controlled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system to inject</font>

110
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:47,319
medicine in 10 patients some security

111
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,780
researchers found a vulnerability they

112
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,690
reported it quietly enclosed dialogue

113
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,068
and then somebody reported it openly

114
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> triggered a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things first</font>

115
00:04:54,069 --> 00:05:01,569
of all safety notification went out in

116
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:04,479
May I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was May 13 of 2015 saying</font>

117
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:08,710
that the PCA 3pc a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five devices had this</font>

118
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,599
flaw and for healthcare organizations to

119
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,638
take serious precautions when using them

120
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:18,190
later on just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we came out to</font>

121
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,219
DEFCON as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh already mentioned the</font>

122
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">first essentially safety recall of a</font>

00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">medical device without demonstrated</font>

124
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,159
proof of harm no patients had to die<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

125
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,520
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this what went almost unnoticed in</font>

126
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:38,560
the press after the big splashy stuff is

127
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,299
that hospira reported themselves that

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,039
they found new vulnerabilities in their

129
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,990
devices so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> January the ics-cert</font>

130
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:50,800
released a notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> that said</font>

131
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,830
hospira<font color="#E5E5E5"> has identified these things they</font>

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in some cases vulnerabilities and</font>

133
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,909
existing devices in some cases

134
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,090
vulnerabilities and devices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they no</font>

135
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:03,669
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell and in these cases they have</font>

136
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,979
patches available in other cases here's

137
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,380
what to do to avoid the vulnerability so

138
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an instance where on their own</font>

139
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,659
and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-reporting format they took</font>

140
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,940
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative to go and do it now</font>

141
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that wasn't because they got threatened</font>

142
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,039
with a talk at black hat it wasn't

143
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,380

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,740
specifically get them on that pathway

148
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,419
way of saying all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we can't</font>

149
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,539
avoid the fact that we have

150
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,400
vulnerabilities we now must address that

151
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:42,219
and embrace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get on this pathway</font>

152
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,440
to getting them fixed faster so I don't

here from hospira come up and say hello

155
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,180
later but it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on</font>

156
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:55,780
a very good path going forward which is

157
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,830
great another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about</font>

158
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">last year we did a very small private</font>

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,729
quietly very openly and honestly not

a common desire to do the right thing

information sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably</font>

hold everybody but you're all invited

188
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,960
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to overflow we'll figure</font>

189
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,259
out some way to accommodate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it take a</font>

straw poll yes what what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

191
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,979
take a straw poll

192
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:33,068
okay haha I'm afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer that</font>

193
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,879
comes back so is anybody interested in

198
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,120
lot more people come to the table and

199
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,329
and wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage on these things so</font>

200
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,740
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come see me come</font>

201
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:59,638
see Josh and see quatie is over here and

202
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:04,000
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell you where that's going to be</font>

203
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,740
what's up it was magical it was yeah

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like an hour</font>

205
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,449
maybe and have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of beers I think</font>

206
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
maybe half a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dozen got beers got drank</font>

207
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:15,430
and we SAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for five hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

208
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,230
like talked it was very very encouraging

209
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,029
which is why we're doing it again<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

210
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,740
year so in the last 12 months a lot of

211
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">things have happened first of all I want</font>

212
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to highlight is December 5th right after</font>

213
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:34,480
the the nhi sac security and privacy

214
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:38,469
meeting up in Boston we held something

215
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,089
called cyber met-rx and we did this in

216
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,529
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring a bunch of the</font>

217
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">stakeholders together who wouldn't</font>

218
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,600
normally talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other get him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

219
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,870
room together cage match you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all of</font>

220
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,750
them in her and<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one leaves no we</font>

221
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,980
did it in a very collaborative manner so

222
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,389
it was a really cool layout that we did

223
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,769
we essentially set the tone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

224
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,439
morning and said we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some hard</font>

225
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:05,490
problems to solve but it's worthy

226
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:08,740
worthwhile cause so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

227
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:11,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">then over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of of the day we</font>

228
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,559
had lightning talks and stakeholders

229
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:18,579
from I think 18 different groups we gave

230
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:20,880
them two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes who are</font>

231
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,899
you what's your role in the ecosystem

232
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,120
what are your hopes dreams and

233
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,269
aspirations as well as your fears if you

234
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,819
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wrong and what can you give and</font>

235
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you need in return and we had</font>

236
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:35,469
those people go and and essentially

237
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,519
identify themselves and say what they do

238
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,120
why they matter and it it was a very

239
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">powerful</font>

240
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,410
message to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there so people who</font>

241
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,180
had been working on the opposite side of

242
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,709
the aisle so these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for years and</font>

243
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,199
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it never really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sat</font>

244
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,760
down and understood what they did why

245
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,230
they did it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were all</font>

246
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,750
pointed in the same direction George

247
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,550
patient safety finally got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chance to</font>

248
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,160
come together and see what that looked

249
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,719
like see what it looked like in practice

250
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,689
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build some of those connections</font>

251
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,640
that otherwise wouldn't have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font>

252
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,320
and to empathize a little bit with the

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,470
position that the other folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in so</font>

254
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,029
you had medical device makers coming and

255
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,650
saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here's what we do and</font>

256
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,120
God if it weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all these</font>

257
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,620
standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

258
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow of course we could do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

259
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,850
things they would be easy then we had

260
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">people coming up like healthcare</font>

261
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,220
delivery organizations saying well look

262
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,050
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these bad medical devices I think</font>

263
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,880
one of the quotes from a different talk

264
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,880
was it's the same crappy software that's

265
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,910
in your windows machine in life and

266
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,670
death situations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you had people</font>

267
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Marie mo who we saw earlier photo</font>

268
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of her and I know she's watching the</font>

269
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,020
live stream now say I'm a patient and

270
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher I depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

272
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,339

273
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:58,270
improved I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what needs to</font>

274
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:01,029
happen I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this device in order to</font>

flaws it has it has way more benefits so

277
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,770
we need to consider all of those types

278
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,690
of things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the mass of getting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those people together the gravitational</font>

best events that i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been to that</font>

287
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,939
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> opened my eyes so I think we're</font>

288
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,610
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of progress by getting</font>

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,470
people together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right room and so</font>

290
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,089
we're actually going to repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we</font>

291
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,680
got an invitation from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dutch</font>

294
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,970
a date set for October tent so anybody

who is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe round octoberish let us</font>

know we can we can see if how we can get

297
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,240
you to that

298
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,750
also we're going to do another one I

299
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,370
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> December seventh I</font>

301
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:05,730
here December seventh okay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

302
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,530
confirmation there we go so december

privacy is privacy and security group so

306
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:21,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again watch this</font>

308
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,290
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened we previewed this a</font>

309
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:31,170
little bit earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> on today in January</font>

310
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,329
just alongside the FDA workshop that

311
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,240
happened we released the Hippocratic

312
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,150
oath for connected medical devices the

313
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,030
idea here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that physicians take a</font>

314
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,850
symbolic oath to act in the best

315
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,800
interest of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> patients increasingly</font>

316
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,720
medical devices are the care delivery

317
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,569
instrument they're the ones carrying out

318
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,790
the orders of the physician so they

319
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:59,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">should also have some type of a symbolic</font>

320
00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:01,829
ethos right this is meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be it we</font>

321
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,140
also wrote it so that anyone in the care

322
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,030
delivery ecosystem can see their own

323
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,730
role reflected in this right so

324
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,620
physicians can read the Hippocratic oath

325
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,620
for connected medical devices and say oh

326
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,110
I see I do this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and this I</font>

contain an isolate failure and in the

346

healthcare context

347
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,470
we made it very specific how do you

348
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,320
avoid harm from failure things like

349

350
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,270
is very common where you have a physical

finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you update once you know</font>

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:32,400
a better way so it's five very simple

356
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,680
capabilities here that many people

357
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,290
within the ecosystem can have some role

367

want to mention that the post market

guidance essentially has a carrot shaped

369

stick or a stick shaped carrot if you

370

will helping to set the incentives for

378
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,840
there's a flaw is that you have the

<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to take a vulnerability report</font>

as a regulatory requirement by a lot of

were there says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single one of</font>

them is thinking about this this is the

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,679
type of change that as researchers we

402
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:30,150
would never be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive right if</font>

we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside knocking on the</font>

405
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,230
going to happen but by teaming up with

406
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,629
those medical device makers with

407
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare organizations with the FDA</font>

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:50,250
types of see changes that will make the

410
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:52,199
world safer I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

411
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,730
about something that you heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

412
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,799
bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning in Karen's talk</font>

413
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,649
if you haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I encourage you</font>

414
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch the recording</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

415
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:04,350
she talked a little bit about a software

416
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,049
bill of materials the idea is when you

417
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,658
go get a car or when you go get a toy

418
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,639
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the materials list is</font>

419
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:14,940
that's in that so when there's a

420
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,649
defective part of that car somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

421
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,200
go and recall it very quickly and safely

422
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:22,199
so in the automotive industry for

423
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,549
instance every bolt every rivet can be

424
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,529
traced back to every plant every

425
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,679
facility every week it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufactured</font>

426
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:30,299
so that when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens it can</font>

427
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,120
really quickly trace it and find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

428
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:37,620
what vehicles are affected right so

429
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:41,610
while we're doing and seeking these

430
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:44,309
things in in some very very easy to

431
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,620
reach places we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it in</font>

432
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,629
software which is trivially easy to do

433
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,850
you can run a simple software script and

434
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,549
figure out what parts of open source

435
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,949
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> in commercial code exists in</font>

436
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:59,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">your medical device or in your software</font>

437
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,159
package the manufacturers certainly know

438
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,879
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> code is in their devices or I would</font>

439
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,440
hope that they know yet we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

440
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we're not we're not publishing it</font>

441
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,740
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philips took the step and said okay</font>

442
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,750
we'll do that we can publish a bill of

443
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,960
materials of what's in our software so

444
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,659
now when a hospital is buying a device

445
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,179
they know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> voll nur abilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

446
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,610
in it that are publicly known so if for

447
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,070
instance heartbleed exists in a device

448
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,780
that you buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> today you can say I'm not</font>

449
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,760
going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that device until you fixed</font>

450
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,730
heartbleed that's a major thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

451
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">need out of my environment</font>

452
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,380
also five years down the line when the

453
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,240
next heartbleed comes out those same

454
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,390
hospitals can very quickly with just a

455
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,790
sequel query rather than an exhaustive

456
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,040
port scan of all their systems figure

457
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">out which of their medical devices which</font>

458
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,750
of their systems has a heart bleed like

459
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,240
vulnerability if we had this for

460
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:00,840
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> in electronic medical record</font>

461
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,760
systems that we knew that half of them

462
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,709
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> JBoss vulnerability that is</font>

463
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,830
actively being exploited by ransomware

464
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,450
and that's shutting down hospitals

465
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,340
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having the response be well</font>

466
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,710
let's see if we get ransomware and then

467
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,990
let's try and pay the ransom it would be

468
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,850
let's eliminate this vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

469
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,820
posing a serious threat to patient

470
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:23,760
safety today that capability is hard

471
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's very very easy however to unlock</font>

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,730
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phillips</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is taking the first</font>

develop those standards she's one of the

co-editors co-authors of the standards

493
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:34,979
that essentially it's a rootkit into the

494
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,290
established processes of many many

495
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,549
manufacturers who know I so if there's

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,490
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and I so</font>

497
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:44,100
they'll just go do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I know I</font>

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it seems crazy but but if you can</font>

Congress<font color="#CCCCCC"> is getting clue full and saying</font>

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,899
kind of makes sense we all know it but

557
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,210
where we can look at the security of

these critical areas to find out what

security conscious person who has spoken

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,200
at Def Con and a physician so first let

575
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,399
me introduce Suzanne Schwartz of the FDA

576
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:11,480
to give a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> her perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

there you go can everybody hear me yes

582
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,570
have to apologize in advance because I'm

583
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,520
going to use some notes here I'm limited

584
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,040
in terms of time and I really felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

585
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,420
was important to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right I have a</font>

concise manner but in a very meaningful

590
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,860
way so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just start off by saying</font>

591
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,330
that I feel very reflective today and

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,209
highly appreciative last August<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

596
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,919
stated at that time that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hopeful</font>

trajectory as you can well imagine when

it's especially when you view that

through the lens of patients<font color="#CCCCCC"> who rely</font>

772
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,790
learned in IT security and try to bring

<font color="#E5E5E5">it to a world that doesn't understand it</font>

he's like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually mean</font>

775
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm like well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

776
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,590
sick and sometimes they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

777
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,720
the hospital<font color="#E5E5E5"> or sometimes they wear</font>

778
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,820
devices that help heal them it's like

779
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,169
yes dad I get that well I try to make

780
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that no bad guys get into them and</font>

781
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,120
break them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hurt them and his first</font>

782
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,400
response was why are they able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

783
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,650
that and then it was why would somebody

784
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,360
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and I've really thought</font>

785
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,120
about that messaging a lot over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

786
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,590
few years and there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> points I</font>

787
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,359
don't want to touch on in this 35

788
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:04,460
minutes that I have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm open</font>

789
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,740
any questions afterwards as well as much

790
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,660
of an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> book as I can be but I will</font>

792
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,779
opinions and not those of Johnson &

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,270
Johnson my attorneys make me say things

794

of Johnson's baby think of your cute

799
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,950
cuddly faces but what a lot of people

800
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,660
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is that Johnson & Johnson is</font>

made up of two hundred over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 250</font>

companies across 60 countries across the

00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:35,720
world about 130,000 employees and we

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,709
so here I am joining J&J five years ago

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and coming to a realization of what the</font>

817
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,300
mostly my background was in the federal

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,910
some of that and after a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few years in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">afterwards and was like hey I work at</font>

830
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,900
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn more about what you're</font>

what you're talking about so fast

forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast-forward through</font>

833

organization of understanding what we

835

have in our inventory today what our

future pipeline is going to be having

837
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,900
all of those tough conversations the

849
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:09,649
different and Suzanne hit on a keyword

850
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,820
that has really<font color="#E5E5E5"> been one that's been</font>

851
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,490
resonating with me lately and that's

852

culture two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago at the FDA public</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare community around this is</font>

00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,310
this really an issue we've zoomed past

that in the past two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years where the</font>

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,270
public workshop this year everybody

859
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,680
understood the issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

860
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:34,009
who were more around how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we solve</font>

861
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,259
them so the cultural issue is not in

862
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:39,080
infosec the cultural issue is outside of

863
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,849
infosec the cultural issue is with the

864
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,279
rd organizations the quality

865
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:46,339
organizations the teams that develop

866
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,160
these amazing life saving products but

867
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:51,410
now slap on some type of bluetooth or

868
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,509
RF or network stack and now all the

869
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:55,129
sudden they have to become a<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec or</font>

870
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,380
IT expert and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what they are</font>

871
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,150
and they operate in a realm where

872
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">security has never historically been</font>

873
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,470
part of where quality sits within a

874
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,359
quality process and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font>

875
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,430
the process but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look inside the</font>

876
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,200
process Security's not mentioned once

877
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,538
and so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through that</font>

878
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,339
effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change that process and that's</font>

879
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">a really big cultural battle and</font>

880
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:16,670
challenge that every medical device

881
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,589
company every hospital has to battle

882
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,210
through and we're fighting through those

883
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,450
challenges and we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of</font>

884
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,950
wins in a number of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know successes</font>

significant significant accomplishment

890
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,839
for us it took many months of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort</font>

891
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,029
getting the right support and buy-in

from everybody who would impact it you

893
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,069
know I mentioned we have 265 operating

894
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,808
companies all of our franchises are

895

independent of one another they don't

896
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:49,520
talk to each other we're a security team

crap out of our framework we didn't go

905

into a bubble and say this is how we're

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> compete on security we talked to</font>

the government we talked to researchers

912
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,819
we really tried to understand the

913
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,740
approaches people have taken to build a

914
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:29,270
solid program of what we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is solid</font>

915
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,979
you know we focus on the NIST

916
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,869
cybersecurity framework we focus on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">from a cyber security perspective and</font>

922
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,450
we've really tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how we</font>

923
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:46,309
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these built into a program</font>

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fits into a quality process that</font>

925
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,329
doesn't understand security because if

926
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,520
we go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process with something</font>

928
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to understand it so we have to do a lot</font>

929
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,349
of language translation which josh

930
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:59,599
talked about this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> really take</font>

931
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,130
what we talked about in security and put

932
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,069
it into their language and their speak

933
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,349
so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about threats</font>

934
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:07,119
to then that's a hazard and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

935
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:08,739
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way and we've really</font>

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,069
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt that internally to help</font>

community projects or what we call them

940
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:18,910
one we we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bit at than</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">source within the healthcare community</font>

944
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,989
our framework so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing for</font>

945
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:27,430
threat modeling what we're doing for

946
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,949
security requirements how we're building

947
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,848
out our assessment questionnaires and

948
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:33,640
sharing that with the greater good of

949
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:36,069
the healthcare world so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nhi</font>

950
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,140
sack as a forum to pass that through to

951
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:39,969
the other organizations you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

952
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">most that don't know eighty percent of</font>

953
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:44,829
the medical device companies that are

954
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,719
out there have 50 or fewer employees 50

955
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,069
or fewer now how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them do you</font>

956
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,079
think are dedicated or understand

957
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:51,519
security there are the ones that need

958
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,539
help and if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them were going</font>

959
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the best that we can uh so finally</font>

960
00:41:55,539 --> 00:42:00,400
and I try not to run too long here is is

961
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,979
you know back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my son's video there he</font>

962
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,680
talks about he called me a superhero I'm

963
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:07,209
not a superhero I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a guy in a</font>

964
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,578
company trying to do the right thing

965
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:11,828
trying to make our devices safer and

966
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,999
secure I mean if I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw a term</font>

967
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,529
around I'll steal one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of josh's and</font>

968
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:16,058
maybe called myself and my team super

969
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:18,219
change agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's ultimately</font>

970
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:19,390
what we are we're security guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

971
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:21,400
tech guy by trade I used to love

972
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:23,109
breaking network equipment and now I get

973
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,729
to try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and work to change</font>

974
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:25,989
culture in the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical device</font>

975
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:28,419
company in the world that touches 1

976
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:30,369
billion patients per day and to me

977
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,019
that's exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and empowering because I</font>

978
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,089
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like every day I'm making a</font>

979
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:38,890
difference so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

980
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:40,880
opportunity and I appreciate it thank

981
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:46,040
you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much Colin</font>

982
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,720
so next up we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to j</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Radcliffe will</font>

983
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,960
make the long walk from the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

984
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,120
room where all the cool kids set up to

985
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,740
the very front I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody</font>

986
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,080
shocked that I would be in the back of

987
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,509
the room right so it's been a really

988
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,540
interesting kind of journey in looking

989
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,370
at the research that I've done and what

990
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,009
it kind of what it kind of means to me

991
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:10,790
as a security researcher and as an IT

992
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,050
professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out this just by</font>

993
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,310
playing around with something playing

994
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,350
around with my medical device to see

995
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,150
what happened and to see what would it

996
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,480
would do and at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I did that</font>

997
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:22,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't really think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything of it and</font>

998
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,860
it turns out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's become a very</font>

999
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:27,950
large issue and it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

1000
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,110
issue and watching the last hour here

<font color="#E5E5E5">and seeing all the progress that this</font>

1002
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,220
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> has made and seeing all the</font>

1003
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,310
progress that we have made collectively

1004
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:41,270
as a community by building something

1005
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:43,240
where manufacturers have a stake and

1006
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,650
they're saying yes we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

1007
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,810
individuals are pushing up from the

1008
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,640
bottoms of their companies saying this

1009
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,220
is something that's really important

1010
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,160
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really believe</font>

1011
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:59,419
in that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do pushing on the</font>

1012
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,640
media areas so that way executives get

1013
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea of yes this is something that's</font>

1014
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,230
important it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that we can</font>

1015
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:10,760
hide<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can do</font>

1016
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:13,700
something about five years ago when I

1017
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,520
kick-started this there was a lot of

1018
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,790
hiding nobody had a plan nobody knew

1019
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,980
what to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and as a consultant I have</font>

1020
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,509
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great insight because people call</font>

1021
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,950
our company up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have us help</font>

1022
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:28,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">them out in this and they asked us all</font>

1023
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:31,399
right we've got executive approval you

1024
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,440
know we have a huge hospital and we we

1025
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,940
hired one person and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave them five</font>

1026
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,869
thousand dollars we want them to secure

1027
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,259
everything

1028
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:41,220
can you please help us do that and

1029
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:44,039
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really where we're kind of at</font>

1030
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,558
right now we have an excited top end of

1031
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,390
the branch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can give us limited</font>

1032
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,640
resources that want something done and

1033
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,078
we have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the bottom that wants</font>

1034
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,359
something done and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

1035
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,539
resources to do it so we're in this

1036
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,670
execution stage and I look at some of

1037
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:01,680
the slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Suzanne presented about</font>

1038
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,319
the life cycle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the communication and</font>

1039
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,269
things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and that's great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

1040
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,940
love that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a plan to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

1041
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:11,008
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think about a plan and if</font>

1042
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that plan worked great we wouldn't have</font>

1043
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:14,730
any problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think about a quote from</font>

1044
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,499
mike tyson and Mike Tyson says

1045
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,710
everybody's got a plan until I get

1046
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:22,589
punched<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the face and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

1047
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,940
that's where I feel that I'm at and I

1048
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:27,420
know that other people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my industry</font>

1049
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:30,119
are at we've got a great plan we go into

1050
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">an organization they want help they're</font>

1051
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,599
very cooperative they want to do it we

1052
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:38,939
start the plan and something goes wrong

1053
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,720
somebody disagrees somebody doesn't want

1054
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,749
to cooperate and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

1055
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,660
right now is for us to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> engaged in</font>

1056
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:52,348
that process we can't get frustrated and

1057
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:54,739
we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quit at that point in time we</font>

1058
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:58,170
have to stay engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the process and</font>

1059
00:45:54,739 --> 00:46:01,200
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward sometimes when</font>

1060
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:05,630
I present research to accompany it

1061
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,649
doesn't go real well they don't like it

1062
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:12,359
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I smile and I say hey</font>

first thing I'm a teacher about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctors</font>

1127
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:06,900
is that 99.999% of them know nothing

1128
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:09,960
about what you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it's not</font>

1129
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they don't care it's not because</font>

order a drug and that drug is being

1139
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,509
delivered to that patient and it's a

1140

life-saving drug that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't even</font>

look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that machine you don't look at</font>

its name is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a</font>

1145
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,230
horrible track record you don't know if

00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,569
it doesn't work I said absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1147
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:49,290
no idea I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that order in a computer</font>

1148
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:51,180
it goes to a nurse that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a room 200</font>

1149

1150
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,390
out of the pharmacy and gets infused in

1151
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:57,599
that patient and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else</font>

1152
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:58,650
about it frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part if</font>

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not running around the emergency</font>

00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,490
like your third arm everyone in here has

00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,140
so many different devices on them that

1161
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,379
are part of their everyday life that is

what you know now if you have been

1166

paying attention today you know that is

you see you throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> something at me if you</font>

1183
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:12,560
them because what they offer is a very

1184
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:14,460
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the conversation okay</font>

1185
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,440
the second thing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach you</font>

1186
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,100
about doctors is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're hackers to</font>

1187
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,680
they just don't know it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

1188
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:25,620
know it let's talk about this what do

1189
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:28,040
they do they look at a system the human

1190
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,569
body and they recognize where it breaks

1191
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,240
they recognize when it breaks down and

1192
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">it causes cancer it causes infectious</font>

1193
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,069
disease the trauma associated with a

1194
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,470
high impact motor vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> collision they</font>

1195
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,910
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your spleens not working</font>

1196
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,879
because you're bleeding to death it's

1197
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,470
been fractured in half that system that

1198
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,390
is supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font>

1199
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,919
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where it's failing this is</font>

1200
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,279
what I'm gonna do to interviewing this

1201
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what I'm going to patch okay but</font>

1202
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of moron well everyone just</font>

1203
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,710
patch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's how is that really the hacker</font>

1204
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:01,470
ethos well physicians implement

1205
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,260
treatments to circumvent disease that's

1206
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:06,509
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do every day we</font>

1207
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:10,110
recognize that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways around</font>

1208
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:11,640
problems and we think innovatively we

1209
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:15,030
see where these vulnerabilities are and

1210
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,020
we attack them we fix them etc doctors

1211
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,470
do the same thing through treatments

1212
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,970
they recognize that cancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> some cancers</font>

1213
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,129
work a certain way they involve certain

1214
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:25,379
genes they recognize that chemotherapy

1215
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,820
will work for some of them radiation

1216
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,400
work for some of them a combination of

1217
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:32,700
it they figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the problem and they</font>

1218
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,910
fix it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they recognize what's broken</font>

1219
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,230
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you guys out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there so take</font>

1220
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:40,230
that understanding when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:43,020
engage them say unlock that hacker

within that<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare provider talk to</font>

1226
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,400
that machine broke over there that

00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,590
machine that's delivering a very potent

1228
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,900
medication that's keeping that very sick

about that everyone cares about that

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,470
well that device that we're talking

that up can hurt your patient and all of

00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,359
and they might not care about it to say

I'm to go and take some course work on

at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ten years and the vendors have</font>

1276
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:09,240
forgotten about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the biomed people</font>

1277
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,160
say it works it's too expensive fix it

1278
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,319
we haven't gotten money to do it we

1279
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have another bolus of money until</font>

1280
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,880
the next cycle we're already striving

1281
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:19,650
you know really struggling to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

1282
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the patients we have right now with</font>

1283
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,250
the medications they need this is a hard

1284
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:26,350
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why you're</font>

1285
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,330
here hopefully this is why you're paying

1286
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:31,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention it's because you recognize</font>

1287
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is what matters and let's</font>

1288
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:37,300
strip away for a minute the term the

1289
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,710
patient that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I say I say I see</font>

1290
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,800
lots of patients every day I saw

1291
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,060
patients last night until 2am and that

1292
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,130
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> me cope with the fact that</font>

1293
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,630
sometimes it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about them</font>

1294
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:49,990
as people because a lot of bad stuff

1295
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:54,340
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1296
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:57,899
they are your daughters your son's your

1297
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">mother's your grandparents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their you and</font>

1298
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,800
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more than anyone else on</font>

1299
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,190
this planet this is problems going to

1300
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,770
get worse the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of doctors</font>

1301
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:11,050
grew up with cell phone with smartphones

1302
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,759
glued to their hands and they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1303
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,820
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single problem out</font>

1304
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,950
there with as an app or another medical

1305
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,780
device the next generations of doctors

1306
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,950
and entrepreneurs in the medical sphere

1307
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,520
are going to push<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this even harder</font>

1308
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:25,960
it's going to explode we recognize that

1309
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,160
we are not going to be able to fix this

1310
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:32,940
problem unless we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

1311
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:35,799
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing to do</font>

1312
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate this time this</font>

1313
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,390
opportunity again think give it up for

1314
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,390
the Calvary
