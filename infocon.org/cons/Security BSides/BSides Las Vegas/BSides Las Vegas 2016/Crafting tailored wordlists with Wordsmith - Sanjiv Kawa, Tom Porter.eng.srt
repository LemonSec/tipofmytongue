00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,450
you yeah thanks guys for coming out

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,250
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool talks happening in</font>

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,889
this 10 a.m. time slot so yeah we're

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,910
thankful you guys came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this one and</font>

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:35,219
against me would we're both pen testers

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,949
with PSC<font color="#E5E5E5"> PSC specializes in pci</font>

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,430
assessments as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also do pen</font>

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,800
testing and non<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI contexts our</font>

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,210
day-to-day kind of just involves going

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,529
through large and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fries organizations</font>

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,989
and going through various Network

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,449
segments trying to find cardholder data

21
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,309
we're also looking for pen testers so if

22
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,769
you know any or if you're interested in

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,570
pen testing either come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see Tom and</font>

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,660
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> after or joe over here in the front</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll be happy to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so</font>

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Before we jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a quick primer</font>

27
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:06,750
what's wordsmith well it's just

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically a tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which can generate</font>

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,590
dictionaries the only thing that we're

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing differently is that we are</font>

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,049
generating dictionary is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,250
states and specifically geolocation data

33
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,840
geolocation data can just basically

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,040
going to be boiled<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to city's</font>

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,710
landmarks zip codes area codes towns and

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
that sort of thing we'll get into exact

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,429
sort of data sets that we're collecting

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,929
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll also go into some statistics a</font>

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,850
bit later but we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> these word</font>

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,860
lists and we're just going against and

41
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,949
cracking against large hash sets or just

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,479
hash sets in general to identify what

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,220
sort of passwords people have and if

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,060
they're introducing geo base passwords

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,100
into their phrases so yeah we're going

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick primer here just</font>

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,729
basic authentication process as well as

48
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between passwords and</font>

49
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,750
hashes and dictionary attacks we've

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,570
timed it it should take about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,469
minutes it's about eight slides in total

52
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,820
for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already who already</font>

53
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,829
know about password attacks and

54
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,619
dictionary attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hashes and</font>

55
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,229
that sort of thing there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

56
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,649
an image on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

57
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can tweet us the hash type that's in</font>

58
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,810
this image we've some swag that we're

59
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,319
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> away so we've got like</font>

60
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,540
case logic backpacks and I think phone

61
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,920
speaker amplifiers and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single selfie</font>

62
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,109
stick for someone who really<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants to</font>

63
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">help me stick I guess so that's our</font>

64
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter handles I think it's also in</font>

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">your brochures or go and check out</font>

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,069
wordsmith I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> made the repo public so</font>

67
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,720
you can find it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess just</font>

68
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,060
as a quick show of hands how many pen

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,630
testers are in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone do</font>

70
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,459
pen testing Joe a couple of a couple

71
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,930
guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there great so if you've ever</font>

72
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,459
done any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of man in the middle of</font>

73
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,720
attack on your on your network and I

74
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,040
guess if you're a blue team who's ever

75
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,200
done a man-in-the-middle attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

76
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,840
network this might look this hash type

77
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,420
should look pretty familiar to you so

78
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,650
yeah here it is you got kind of a couple

79
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,980
seconds here to take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that and</font>

80
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,660
and send us a tweet here at our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

81
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,630
handles and we're happy to give away

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,489
some swag after but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we'll head</font>

83
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,400
back to the primer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,910
walk you guys through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary thanks</font>

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,630
Andrea so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple</font>

86
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:19,709
authentication process this is Bob and

87
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extent of my Microsoft Paint skills</font>

88
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,940
despite what Bob's prohibition-style hat

89
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,310
might suggest bob is a user in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

90
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,670
environment and this is Bob logging into

91
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a Windows host with a user name of Bob</font>

92
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,390
and this might be locally on a

93
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,489
workstation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ordered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unlock yet this</font>

94
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,480
might be remotely via something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our</font>

95
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,739
DP and we've taken the liberty here to

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,548
unmask the password field so you can see

97
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,910
that Bob's password is password 123 on

98
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,489
submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own Bob clicks in turn that</font>

99
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,280
input ups password 123 is put into a

100
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,790
one-way hash function and the output of

101
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,799
that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed length character string</font>

102
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,590
what you see represented a blow that's

103
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,079
what we call a hash and what's important

104
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,660
to note here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one-way</font>

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,060
function we can't reverse this process

106
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,980
by putting a hash into the hashing

107
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,769
function and retrieving the original

108
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,918
clear text password so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

109
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,530
hashed the password we put together

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,120
Bob's username and password hash and we

111
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">send it to the authentication server</font>

112
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,950
this might be locally in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> same database</font>

113
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,550
if you're joined to a domain this might

114
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,830
be

115
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,699
Active Directory domain controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntds</font>

116
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,719
get this back-end<font color="#E5E5E5"> database holds and</font>

117
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,639
this is a little bit of

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,699
oversimplification but this backward

119
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,210
back-end database holds a listing of all

120
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,409
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users and their password hashes so</font>

121
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,628
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not storing passwords and clear</font>

122
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,370
text here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and from there we basically</font>

123
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,430
just do a lookup of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob supplied</font>

124
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,069
credentials we find the record for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bob</font>

125
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,039
and we match the supplied password hash

126
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:59,889
with the stored one fits correct we

127
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,199
allow the login if it's incorrect we'll

128
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:06,789
bump up the failed login count and deny

129
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:10,270
the login so we can traverse this

130
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:13,840
hashing process so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we convert a</font>

131
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:17,198
hash back to its original string the

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,479
answer is there's no direct<font color="#CCCCCC"> way but what</font>

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do have are a very particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set of</font>

134
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:26,469
words words that make pastor cracking a

135
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:28,569
nightmare for hashes like these and we

136
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:30,610
particularly use a dictionary attack so

137
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,099
what are dictionaries there's simply

138
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,380
just large list of words usually grouped

139
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,000
together by<font color="#CCCCCC"> some type of theme so they</font>

140
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,120
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> come from password reaches like</font>

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">LinkedIn yahoo or dobby there's also a</font>

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,690
great wordless out on the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,020
can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free like rock you tap 10k</font>

144
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,000
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even some paid ones like unique</font>

145
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,830
despite its price tag unique is a

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">password list that any pen tester or</font>

147
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">auditors should have in their toolkit so</font>

148
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:59,110
in order to carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> out dictionary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

149
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,878
first we need a few prereqs first is a

150
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,620
solid dictionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> or good word list</font>

151
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,900
second thing when you know is the hash

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,050
type so in this case with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob we're</font>

153
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,090
using NT hashes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntlm if you're</font>

156
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,020
variation of md5 or shawl 12 usually

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,659
with assault the third<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

158
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,029
need are a list of password hashes and

159
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,669
these are usually exfiltrated from

160
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,960
compromised systems maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a local</font>

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,210
Directory domain controller and these

163
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,219
what we're doing the lookups against so

164
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">the steps are actually carrying out a</font>

dictionary attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> boil</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

166
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,720
three-step process we call the guests

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,000
encrypt compare cycle

168
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,680
our guesses are words that we're

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,380
plucking from the word list and we

170
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,630
iterate through<font color="#E5E5E5"> them one by one from</font>

171
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">there we take the input word and we put</font>

172
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it into our encryption algorithm in this</font>

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,110
case an NT hashing algorithm and it gets

174
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,849
outputted this fixed length string then

175
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,100
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hash and we do a look up</font>

176
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,160
against our list of obtained password

177
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,510
hashes if we if they match then we know

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,340
we can map that back to the original

179
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,490
word that we guess and we have our clear

180
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,789
text password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sanji when we've on to</font>

181
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,540
wordsmith yeah so as we mentioned

182
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,100
briefly at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the</font>

183
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,910
presentation where Smith is just a

wordless generation tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> US states</font>

185
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,770
and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> geolocation base data so</font>

186
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,510
what kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geo data is in a word list</font>

187
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,109
well we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like cities and</font>

188
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,250
towns we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have landmarks so in</font>

189
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,660
Nevada you're going to have area 51

190
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,750
things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hoover Dam that sort of</font>

191
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,419
thing we've got streets and roads we

192
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,590
have zip codes sport teams colleges

193
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,930
common names and area codes now why

194
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,340
geolocation data well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

195
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,260
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it's kind of a</font>

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,940
marriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> between curiosity and password</font>

197
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,360

201
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,260
my post exploitation process I tend to

202
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,729
go from system to system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> scrape</font>

203
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,469
credentials out of memory just using

<font color="#CCCCCC">kiwi or maybe cast or something like</font>

205
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that usually enables me to</font>

206
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,419
collect a large amount of passwords to

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,040
then enable me to move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

210
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,010
depth into that environment now

211
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,500
collecting all these passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

212
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,090
realized a common trend for several of

213
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,490
these users and that's I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> crack</font>

214
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,320
these because these are specific geo

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,820
location based passwords that weren't

216

going to exist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort of password</font>

sport team names or colleges or other

<font color="#E5E5E5">geolocation so thought to myself well be</font>

221
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,240
pretty neat if someone put together a

222
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,950
wordless generation tool and then that

223
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,030
kind of transformed to well we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,730
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together wordless generation tool</font>

225
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,470
for geolocation data and as we'll get

226
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,180
into some statistics of it later we kind

227
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,130
of find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that we've limited some</font>

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,130
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite useful so if it should</font>

231
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,980
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention where's all this data</font>

232
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,680
coming from well Wikipedia in the US

233
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">census have a ton of this data and it's</font>

234
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to the public all we've</font>

235
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,960
done is we pulled it scraped it and put

236
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,840
it into nice little phrases and words

237
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,360
which appear in word lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> openstreetmap</font>

238
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is another good source as well we've</font>

239
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,820
also had to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a collection of</font>

240
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,170
data sets for area codes because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

241
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,600
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder harder to parse</font>

242
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,099
using our posting engine so and required

243
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,750
a bit heavier parsing so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

244
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,140
have some custom data sets which we made

245
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,820
as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> tom is going to talk to you</font>

246
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,850
about how wordsmith works and then we're

247
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:39,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump into a demo so yeah take</font>

248
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">away cool so the github repo is live now</font>

249
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,470
when you do your initial get pool you'll

250
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,210
see these files listed there on the

251
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,820
right you see the actual wordsmith ruby

252
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,760
file there's also next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the sources</font>

253
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,560
amo file as basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a simple</font>

254
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,920
configuration file for all the internet

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,329
sources were pulling down from data and

256
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,130
we broke it out like that to hopefully

257
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,950
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little easier in a modular</font>

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,880
sources next to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see a data</font>

261
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,410

262
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,900
compressed data archive where we've

263
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,420
already pre scraped all of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:21,949
we're using from where forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> smith and</font>

265
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,719
compress it there you'll also find a gem

266
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,490
file just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make installation a little</font>

267
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,470
bit simpler and there's a readme there

268
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,880
which you'll see in the repo that<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk</font>

269
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,090
you through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the dependencies and</font>

270
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,130

271
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,630
wordsmith for the first time it's going

290
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,510
directory so you see a city's<font color="#E5E5E5"> de HTML</font>

291
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,180
their colleges<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> L landmarks Road</font>

292
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,550
zips these are words very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to</font>

293
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,579
that state if you notice the dot HTML

294
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,410
extension these are actual HTML source

295
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,570
files that we've pulled down from our

296
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,189
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources and the reason we've</font>

297
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,350
done it like this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've added</font>

298
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,770
an update option<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that wordsmith</font>

299
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,180
it's a dash you flag so sometime down

300
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,640
the road if you'd like to update your

301
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,050
data manually you specify the update

302
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,880
flag and actually go out to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

303
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,520
sources and update your local data

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,920
repository for you to parse this data

305
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,470
we're using gems like nokogiri and

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,959
spider hmm and we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these lookups</font>

307
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,560
offline so locally just for speed

308
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,210
performance so a word lists has been

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">generated by wordsmith kind of looks</font>

310
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,530
like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

311
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:10,040
Sanjeev went through earlier with roads

312
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,420
from Nevada<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular Fremont Street so</font>

313
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,849
the word as it comes out of wordsmith

314
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,680
looks like that's a capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> F there is a</font>

315
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,020
space in there there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period at the</font>

316
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,530
end so we add in some just very basic

317
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:24,380
mingling for words so we can split on

318
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,079
spaces set<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakout Fremont Street into</font>

319
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:31,400
two separate words we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove special</font>

320
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:34,400
characters we can remove spaces there's

321
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,400
also options to convert all the words to

322
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,110
lowercase if that's your preference you

323
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,209
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also specify a minimum character</font>

324
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,580
length so let's say you've compromised a

325
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,260
domain where you know the password

326
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,300
policy has a mem character length of

327
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight we can specify the dash or at the</font>

328
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,780
minimum length here and it will truncate

329
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,720
all words<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are not at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least eight</font>

330
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,689
characters in length and now Sanjeev

331
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,400
will take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the demo I've seen</font>

332
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,050
some really bad things happen with live

333
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:08,410
demos in the past so let's hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all</font>

334
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:08,410
goes well all right so is that text

335
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:17,279
how's that can anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there you</font>

336
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,529
go get bigger cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah as Tom</font>

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,809
mentioned these are kind of the initial

338
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">get pull files and if we just go ahead</font>

339
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:27,389
and run the wordsmith for the first time

340
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:29,489
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

341
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,899
get unpacked there's also a warning

342
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,759
message that you see here it says that

343
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,249
cool is not found<font color="#E5E5E5"> in path now that's</font>

344
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I'm running wordsmith on my OSX</font>

345
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:38,759
system i don't have cool installed but

346
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,139
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running this on cali or</font>

347
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,609
something it's going to pick that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font>

348
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:47,369
your path variable and you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

349
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:49,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">use cool now the purpose of cool is</font>

350
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:54,359
because we've integrated support for

351
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:55,589
things like domains and in files so for

352
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,959
those of you who are in familiar cool

353
00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:01,259
basically if you specify a domain name

354
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,729
let's say client<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm or facebook com it</font>

355
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">will give up to that domain and a look</font>

356
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,559
for unique words and scrape it from that

357
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:09,449
application and the default cool

358
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,699
settings i think stays within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope</font>

359
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:14,069
of that domain name and it only goes a

360
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:15,389
certain recursive depth and follows any

361
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,729
hyperlinks that take you to any other

362
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:21,360
links on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope and it'll pull the</font>

363
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,889
clients name it'll pull other unique

364
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,959
words and strip out some of the common

365
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:28,439
words like of the any connection verbs

366
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,238
things like this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also have</font>

367
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,279
an in file where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you specify various</font>

368
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:35,040
client domain names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all this is just</font>

369
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,139
a better populate this wordlist so we've

370
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,610
integrated support for cool however you

371
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,839
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use it because we also</font>

372
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,980
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other options now as as we</font>

373
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,679
kind of mentioned from a top-down

374
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,360
approach it all starts from a state and

375
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,249
typically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I generate a wordsmith</font>

376
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,110
word list I'll use a dash all option and

377
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:54,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">alls going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give me cities colleges</font>

378
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:59,279
landmarks phone numbers roads teams zip

379
00:14:54,449 --> 00:15:02,429
codes and also names name so names would

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">be like common last names baby names you</font>

381
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,850
have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many times I see a</font>

382
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:08,789
first name or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a baby name as part of a</font>

383
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:12,329
password yeah so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess this one</font>

384
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:14,699
through an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example so step to set the</font>

385
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,199
state for California and we'll look at

386
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,199
some common sport teams there

387
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,189
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all of the</font>

388
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,079
sport teams in California and that's

389
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,420
just doing a basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up on the HTML</font>

390
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,670
files that we've already pre<font color="#CCCCCC"> polled now</font>

391
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,529
these are great but we can also mangle

392
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,870
these and get every single permutation

393
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,910
of these words so as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here</font>

394
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,920
we've got Sacramento Kings Sacramento

395
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,019
Kings<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sacramento and somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up here</font>

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be kings as well and</font>

397
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,310
there's only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've</font>

398
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,899
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably some other teams here</font>

399
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,219
which have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kings in their name but we</font>

400
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,540
also do a sort and unique so you don't

401
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,120
get duplicate words and things like this

402
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:57,959
what's also pretty neat is that we do

403
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,350
things like zip codes so we've got every

404
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,619
single zip code in Nevada or landmarks

405
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,269
so if we set the state to DC we can look

406
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,029
at landmarks and we probably tend to see

407
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:12,120
things like white house or or whatever

408
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:19,620
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lafayette building things like</font>

409
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:21,779
this yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we set the state to</font>

410
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,410
maybe Massachusetts we can look at some

411
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:29,339
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the colleges that exist there so</font>

412
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:38,040
these are probably see Harvard or MIT at

413
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:39,300
some point in here yeah so as I

414
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,829
mentioned before these are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

415
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,569
options the singular options that you

416
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,699
can set for<font color="#CCCCCC"> per state we can also do</font>

417
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or for example CA and</font>

418
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:49,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nevada and grab me all the area codes</font>

419
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,920
for those two states now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

420
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,600
verbose output so i guess the inverse so

421
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,130
that would be quiet output so let's set

422
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,070
the state for<font color="#CCCCCC"> california we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

423
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">grab everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we possibly can and</font>

424
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,750
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have it as verbose as</font>

425
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,730
this and so you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing some</font>

426
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,500
things here how many landmarks there are

427
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,520
any zip codes there are but this isn't

428
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,679
really useful because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not getting</font>

429
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,549
any words so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go ahead and output</font>

430
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,870
this to a file like<font color="#E5E5E5"> California txt you</font>

431
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,150
know collect all this data and stick it

432
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,770
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> word list for you but as we kind</font>

433
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,780
of mentioned before these are just the

434
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,329
actual words and sells these aren't the

435
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,209
mangled versions so you can specify the

436
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">M flag change that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to California mangled</font>

437
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,130
and now you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this will</font>

438
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,680
attorney time here for especially the

439
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,210
roads because there's 250,000 roads that

440
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">were now going to have to mangle which</font>

441
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,710
now helped but almost double the amount

442
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,380
so like Tom and mentioned earlier we've

443
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,120
split on space we've concatenated we had

444
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,660
stripped symbols and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

445
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,979
this any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> options that anyone</font>

447
00:17:51,980 --> 00:18:02,670
see if a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> college at someone</font>

448
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:04,710
went to a state shows up I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

449
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,780
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much overlap there is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

450
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,940
benefit there is restricting advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> date</font>

451
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,160
sure so you we also have an option built

452
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,660
in here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so you can turn through</font>

453
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,930
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single state and create a mega</font>

454
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,690
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list for everything as well but so</font>

455
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,040
that's yeah it's totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> an option as</font>

456
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see you'll just start spitting</font>

457
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,639
out everything is just an array mm-hmm

458
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,260
well yeah so but that's the with the

459
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,210
quiet option if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remove the quiet we're</font>

460
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,270
going to grab basically it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

461
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:38,090
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on churning like that yeah yeah</font>

462
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,090
so sorry there's another question yeah

463
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,670
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great option yeah sorry it's a</font>

464
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,050
great term yeah so sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah he said</font>

465
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,720
how do you account for local businesses

466
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,820
so the dash D flag for the cool

467
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,570
integration so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you're testing</font>

468
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,950
a particular client the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

469
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,240
probably going to be some password

470
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,300
variation in there that's a client named

471
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">1 2 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that that cool integration</font>

472
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,790
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that client's web</font>

473
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,320
application pick out the clients name

474
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,670
and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this wordlist for you as</font>

475
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,470
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have internet</font>

476
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,820
connectivity here because we're at

477
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,490
bsides and I don't want to connect to

478
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,000
Wi-Fi so I can't show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the cool</font>

479
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,700
integration aspects of it but yeah

480
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,410
that's that's basically what our

481
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,820
wordsmith the demo is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and was really</font>

482
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,620
interesting or some statistics that

483
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to kind of show you guys and</font>

484
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,389
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you've heard me talk enough so</font>

485
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,389
let Tom just kick that off cool

486
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,270
yeah so we wanted to measure how

487
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,340
effective geolocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> bayless based</font>

488
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,200
wordless<font color="#E5E5E5"> where see this we need a couple</font>

489
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,230
of tests some of the prereqs for this

490
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,180
test we first built a hash cracking rig

491
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,420
locally in our shop and we got our hands

492
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,400
on some real NT hashes so we grabbed

493
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,920
some hashes from actual real-world

494
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,870

cracking rig itself our weapon of choice

499
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,580
for cracking NT hashes is hash cap the

500
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware is fairly modest was just an</font>

nvidia grid k 5 20 but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that we</font>

502
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,740
could get about 3 billion guests and

crypt compare cycles per second so

504

returning through passwords fairly

process of doing so in amazon's AWS it

510
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:42,070
takes you through the steps of spinning

511
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,110
up on ec2 instance getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hash cat</font>

the test cases that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,600
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> first we're going to crack</font>

516
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,110
hashes from each of those states using

517
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,070
some basic word lists and some rules and

518
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,139
then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going to</font>

519
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,870
supplement that with word<font color="#CCCCCC"> list generated</font>

generate those worthless and wordsmith

522
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,570
is shown at the bottom there the base

523
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,820
way to read that is the dash S flag is

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> wisconsin the dash a were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grabbing</font>

from of those word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list so we're using</font>

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,440
so I Wisconsin Massachusetts in New York

541
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,940
and we chose the rule set of dead hobo

542
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,519
just because it's one of our favorites

543
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,389
it's got about 57,000 rules for doing

some advanced word mangling the compare

<font color="#CCCCCC">Sanjay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will discuss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the results</font>

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,259
2011<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell'em hashes which kind of</font>

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:29,629
can be translated into 2011 Active

557
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,490
Directory user accounts which can kind

558
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:33,019
of further be translated into 2011

559
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,580
employees although that might not

560
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:36,919
necessarily be true because there might

561
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,689
be some accounts being shared so we'll

562
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say 2011 Active Directory user</font>

563
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,490
accounts now as Tom had previously

mentioned the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10k wordless is just a</font>

567
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:52,370
anyone who's seen hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll get</font>

568
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,979
that reference but yeah we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:08,330
append numbers lowercase<font color="#E5E5E5"> words camelcase</font>

574
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,639
words so for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> word you're</font>

575
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,850
doing 58,000 different permutations of

576
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:16,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> world's word based on this rule set</font>

577
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,110
so yeah the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 top passwords</font>

578
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,019
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run against</font>

579
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:23,620
these rules and uncovered 237 of these

580
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:27,039
organizations passwords which means that

581
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,658
237<font color="#E5E5E5"> Active Directory user accounts had a</font>

582
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,299
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was in the top 10 word</font>

583
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:37,100
10,000 word list as a root password in

584
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:41,120
there in there his password string yeah

585
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">rocky uncovered another 1094 passwords</font>

586
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,070
which is in our sixty-six percent of a

587
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:49,100
cracking success in total of all these

588
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,840
hashes and now our<font color="#E5E5E5"> wisconsin generated</font>

589
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,120
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list took 12 seconds to run and</font>

590
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,299
uncovered another eleven percent so as

591
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,508
229 passwords now which should be key

592
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:02,149
here is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> wisconsin word list is</font>

593
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,330
solely it solely consists of geo based

594
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,580
passwords so

595
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,159
at this point we've cracked sixty-six

596
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,129
percent of the passwords but the

597
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,400
additional 229 passwords are all things

598
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:17,070
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> city's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support teams landmarks zip</font>

599
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:22,560
codes and things to that effect so

600
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:23,760
there's a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there there</font>

601
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be duplicates so this is a</font>

602
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,050
collective cracking session it's called

603
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,950
basically your hash cracking pot would

604
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,360
be populated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with sixty-six percent of</font>

605
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,130
these passwords at this point and so as

606
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,290
a collective<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition so yeah we incur</font>

607
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,460
bird another 12 oh sorry eleven percent

608
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,500
of passwords that were all geocentric

609
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,210
now yeah so if i remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly</font>

610
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,880
wisconsin some of the really common

611
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,780
passwords like green bay packers first

612
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,780
names and baby names as well

613
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">massachusetts had a smaller hash set</font>

614
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,919
about 400 Active Directory user accounts

615
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,690
that makes top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the 58,000 rules</font>

616
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,930
right about a second and recover 52

617
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,360
passwords which is about an eighth and

618
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,620
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprising because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

619
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,500
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show that some organizations</font>

620
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,540
have really weak password complexity

621
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:16,860
rules and enforcement's<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocky you</font>

622
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:21,300
recovered is staggering sixty-five

623
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,979
percent in 24 minutes and with the dead

624
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,280
hobo rule<font color="#E5E5E5"> set and our wordsmith</font>

625
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,710
generated<font color="#E5E5E5"> were list another 56 and again</font>

626
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,860
this is all geo base word lists or sorry

627
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:35,300
geo location based words which which are

628
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,399
found after in about 12 seconds and

629
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,960
Massachusetts I mean people always<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

630
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,280
support teams names like Red Sox and

631
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,720
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's really</font>

632
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting is you'll see a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of city</font>

633
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,630
names as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Boston Boston</font>

634
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:52,490
Marathon Cambridge and Harvard and

635
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:55,620
Fenway<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Fir landmarks as well New York</font>

636
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,330
552 hashes and 552 Active Directory user

637
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,550
accounts what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really surprising with</font>

638
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,560
New York is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 were recovered with</font>

639
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,870
top 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> K which can we can allude to it</font>

640
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,909
several things here either the Active

641
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,850
Directory domain controller has a

642
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party plugin so this new york</font>

643
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,350
organization has imported a list of

644
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,910
known compromised passwords or bad

645
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,070
passwords into active directory through

646
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,389
some sort of third-party module

647
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,759
which technically refrains users from

648
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:27,149
creating bad passwords or as a non

649
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:30,149
technical control they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have just great</font>

650
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:33,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">security awareness programs or long and</font>

651
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:36,959
complex password requirements or things

652
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,490
like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that being said the rocky word</font>

653
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,429
lists or takes about 26 minutes to run

654
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,500
uncovered about 220 passwords and our

655
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,169
new york words with generated word<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font>

656
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,809
recovered in additional 59 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

657
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:51,210
can imagine some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the popular</font>

658
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:54,059
passwords would be landmarks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> empire</font>

659
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,789
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have some examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for ya</font>

660
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,110
empire<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadway there's also one user in</font>

661
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:01,950
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this state NY</font>

662
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,570
abbreviation and then five numbers which

663
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,399
are the zip code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a symbol as</font>

664
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:11,250
part of his password so yeah tom is

665
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:14,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to kind of summarize that lasts or</font>

666
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:21,509
a segment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there cool so some of the</font>

667
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:25,559
conclusions of this yep uh did you try

668
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:28,379
the new york data but New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash is</font>

669
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,928
against the Wisconsin list no<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't</font>

670
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:34,289
because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very useful to see</font>

671
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:37,470
whether you're actually getting value

672
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:40,200
from your from paying attention to

673
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,149
geography as opposed to just what's on

674
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,940
these lists absolutely so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

675
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:46,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">that crosswise yeah so another to</font>

676
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,779
further extrapolate that we can also

677
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,490
just do all states in general against

678
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,379
that New York word list as well but the

679
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,059
real takeaway here was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of for</font>

680
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:57,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular state and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guest</font>

681
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,100
encrypt<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare cycle so for one state</font>

682
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,840
it took 22 seconds but for all states it

683
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,969
might take an hour who knows we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

684
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,870
actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that yet that's a</font>

685
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:09,840
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so some of the</font>

686
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,100
conclusions from this testing we've got

687
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,379
a little bit of confirmation bias here

688
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,600
in that will get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the psychology of</font>

689
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hell users choose passwords but we know</font>

690
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,889
that users like to choose passwords that

691
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,889
are near<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dear to them they choose</font>

692
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:24,360
passwords off things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know you</font>

693
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:25,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the street they grew up on the name</font>

694
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,959
of their child and that's what we're

695
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,190
seeing reflected here in our results and

696
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,870
with that there's a little bit of a time

697
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU cycle trade</font>

698
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:36,389
in that instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using a blanket word</font>

699
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and looking for low hanging fruit</font>

700
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,190
or spending a little extra time<font color="#CCCCCC"> up front</font>

701
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,290
to craft a more tailored list and we're

702
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,070
spending less time or less<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU cycles</font>

703
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm crunching those less pertinent words</font>

704
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,360
it's a small sample size here but with

705
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,909
these cases we had cracked at least an

706
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,490
additional eleven percent of passwords

707
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,750
in a reasonable amount of time I think

708
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaks a little bit to the</font>

709
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:04,290
relevance of the generated passwords so

710
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">next steps word of wordsmith where we</font>

711
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,550
see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> going we're always thinking</font>

712
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,160
about data we have ideas for more it's

713
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,440
difficult to have a night to actually

714
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,679
marry an idea for data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually find</font>

715
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,170
good sources for it but we like to

716
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,030
expand on say the sports we've seen

717
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,520
users who<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to have their favorite</font>

718
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,950
athlete or the favorite player as a the

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,070
base word of a password maybe team

720
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:31,290
mascots or names of stadiums you could

721
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:34,110
include famous people like politicians

722
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,639
or actresses or actors state symbols

723
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,100
things that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very relevant to a state</font>

724
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,559
such the motto or state song state

725
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,840
flower and we've gotten recommendations

726
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,870
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Larry Pesch she</font>

727
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,959
recommended looking at regional food or

728
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,850
cuisine or agriculture from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design</font>

729
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,700
the code design perspective it is

730
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,209
modular we like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even more</font>

731
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,410
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to have open to extension we</font>

732
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,850
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this framework could be</font>

733
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">extended to not only include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states but</font>

734
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:06,480
also include provinces or territories or

735
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,130
even other countries and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could even</font>

736
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,260
change the granularity of how we're

737
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,030
looking for this when Sanjeev and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I were</font>

738
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,429
concepting wordsmith we're thinking

739
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's scale do we want to start</font>

740
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:18,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">with do we go you know as macro is</font>

741
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:22,440
continent<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we drill down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to country</font>

742
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:25,020
state City Road address actual geo

743
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,970
coordinates so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future version</font>

744
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">could instead of a user in putting a</font>

745
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,429
state they input an address or a pair of

746
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,340
coordinates and they specify a default

747
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,630
radius of say fifty miles and say give

748
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,860
me all the words that wordsmith can

749
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,860
generate in a 50-mile radius

750
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:47,280
so Sanjeev and I are both believers in

751
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:49,440
free and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source software we believe</font>

752
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,260
that everyone should have access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

753
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,240
the source code at all time we also

754
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,158
believe that we're not the smartest

755
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,179
people in this room so if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

have experience with looking at a query

758
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:09,270
in AP is for geocentric type data we

759

773
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,669
for this and I have presents myself tons

774
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them actually but as an example I</font>

775
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:58,140
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to tell you that in the UK</font>

776
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,059
here's one government organization that

777
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,789
keeps on tweeting again and again and

778
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,158
again that are safe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

779
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:08,640
password that is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to remember</font>

780
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,860
is made up of three ec words that's what

781
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:16,830
I keep saying all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> three easy</font>

782
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:19,649
words now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 4 2015 hash cats</font>

783
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:23,330
put out a tweet saying important

784
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:26,309
announcement and there was a hash value

785
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:30,899
in very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short letter words solar the</font>

786
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:34,530
sign of replied to that tweet saying the

787
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:37,590
hash if you can crack<font color="#CCCCCC"> its s hash cut</font>

788
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,750
open source so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way hash cut</font>

789
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:43,168
announced that hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> code was going open</font>

790
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,840
source and solo design of tracked hash

791
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,940
cut open source that's a three world

792
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,740
pass race with spaces in between<font color="#E5E5E5"> worlds</font>

793
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,960
so Jeremy ghastly he responded by asking

794
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,899
so

795
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,659
because solo said that he cracked this

796
00:32:55,899 --> 00:33:05,889
by doing a 10 line focused world list so

797
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:08,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten words he put into his word list and</font>

798
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:12,100
then he cracked a 3 worldpost race and

799
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:15,879
the words<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he put in was hash cut is</font>

800
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:18,760
open source will be will be without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

801
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,970
space in between sourced GPL under

802
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,549
license and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> cracked it so that's</font>

803
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:29,470
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that was like dude</font>

804
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:31,240
yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good now i'm gonna</font>

805
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,720
kick out one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first questions first</font>

806
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,850
for this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

807
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,720
looking into the simple fact that there

808
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:43,059
can be as an example fiscal geographical

809
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,130
locations that consists of what more

810
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">than one name like you have a space in</font>

811
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:51,929
there so the sea of something sea of

812
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,789
oceans or whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it I</font>

813
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,950
does wordsmith today actually take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

814
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,929
into account or will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just say that</font>

815
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:03,640
anything with the space is two different

816
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">words so no we take that into account so</font>

817
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,990
if it if it does have a space we keep

818
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,239
the original string we<font color="#E5E5E5"> split on that</font>

819
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,119
space we concatenate that stirring as

820
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,549
well so we get the common permutations

821
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,950
of that particular word and it also has

822
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,379
that word in the word list<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well on</font>

823
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,270
its singular at level now we didn't want

824
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do too many permutations because we</font>

825
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,310
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cat rules that</font>

826
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,109
people would use afterwards would do

827
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,849
that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so we didn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

828
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word look weird list to inflate it</font>

829
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,599
or too big because josh kappa rules

830
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,570
would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of that in the cracking</font>

831
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,369
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and to keep the keys unique</font>

832
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,530
so of for instance when your input in a

833
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,849
state like for instance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> north</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">carolina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which has a space in our</font>

836
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,319
keys we sub out spaces for just we

837
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:54,550
basically URL encoded just to make sure

838
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,290
we keep the keys unique yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in</font>

839
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,599
your when doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

including<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia and his his his</font>

854
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,650
those spaces and so on but Han Solo is

855

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,290
these three sets and I hope you can do

861
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,049
some more studies on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a particular</font>

862
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,779
the new there was a discussion earlier

863
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:04,070
about the question of and one of the

864
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,570
earlier talks about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> block</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blacklists dictionaries and password</font>

00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,410
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you reject their password they</font>

868
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,140
just add one or one two three two that

869
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,210
and you have a place to actually do an

870
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,730
empirical test there with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font>

874
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,070
into that and see and see how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

875
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,780
fact users having been rejected just did

876
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,630
a simple transformation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I encourage</font>

877
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,130
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more oh great if you want</font>

878
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:43,350
to send us your organization's hashes

quested to the guy you invited I swear

881
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:53,730
so yeah you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wordless at</font>

882
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:57,060
least you provide so to ask kind of a

or score to tell us how likely it is to

collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of words to identify I guess</font>

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,170
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> that being said in our</font>

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:15,020
tool called<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitbull at pipl and that</font>

912
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:17,450
shows the i guess the in terms are

913

percentile how many users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using this</font>

914
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,129
word or this root word in context of all

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,250
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> councillor hashes that we have</font>

916
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,369
or have recovered so the only thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

917
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,020
can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is marrying pitbull and all</font>

918
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:33,170
those common word lists out there but

919
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,940
that take a lot of a lot of computing

920
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,290
power to do that and so it's almost a

921
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,420
project in its own right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a great</font>

922
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:44,480
idea great<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk yeah you should you</font>

923
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:47,720
should think yeah questions I was

924
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,960
wondering on the on the hash set that

925
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were working on did you do any</font>

926
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,380
combination of the word list did you

927
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:57,080
combine the word list<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were</font>

928
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,960
generated from wordsmith with the top

929
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,490
ten thousand or with rock you yeah I

930
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,170
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's like a function and</font>

931
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,500
hash cat for doing that yeah it's

932
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,349
separate from the mangling rules right

933
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,230
yeah no we didn't combine wordless so we

934
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:14,359
were we were kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interested in</font>

935
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,220
the chunking aspect so this is what the

936
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,750
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered this is what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rocky</font>

937
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,299
recovered this is what we recovered

938
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,400
after that entire pot had been populated

939
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,490
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great yeah so if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can combine</font>

940
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,140
password and white house together that'd

941
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be great so this may be something else</font>

942
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,020
that we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

943
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,820
when you started<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on doing this I</font>

944
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,770
mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you know there's</font>

945
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,330
data available massive amounts of data

946
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,030
available for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the geolocation</font>

947
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,340
part of this but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out</font>

948
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,310
doing this was it you know did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

949
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,870
making wordsmith because the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

950
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,960
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you saw you could easily</font>

951
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">use them or did you actually have you</font>

952
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a theory or eventually did you</font>

953
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,950
prove that lots of people actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

954
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,319
new locations as part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> password so</font>

955
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,450
we need this input you know what was the

956
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,200
reason behind starting it so part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

957
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,879
was as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised Active Directory</font>

958
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,939
domains we dumped password hashes we

959
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,740
start cracking one things we do after we

960
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,070
were turning through the rock use in the

961
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,990
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 case is we would come to generate</font>

962
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,790
our own custom word lists based off root

963
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:19,189
words that are for instance like the

964
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:22,040
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and we do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

965
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:25,730
common translations for that converting

966
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,860
zeros to zeros a<font color="#CCCCCC"> stat signs etc and also</font>

967
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,570
just some of the names of local you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

968
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the street</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company is on</font>

969
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,510
or the address we're in the building

970
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,129
resides I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice we started getting</font>

971
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,530
hits after hits after hits using that

972
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,140
pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm so then wordsmith came about</font>

973
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:42,080
as a way to kind of automate and

974
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,190
weaponize that process and as a second

975
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,690
part to that as well we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

976
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,980
it'd be kind of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this because</font>

977
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,590
no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has really done this before</font>

978
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to like the inception of</font>

979
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,280
words with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the story of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I just as</font>

980
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,960
all scraping credentials out of memory I

981
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,050
would see that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been using</font>

982
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,120
these phrases in their passwords so that

983
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:05,300
was kind of like another catalyst for

984
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:07,790
this tool you can invest us an email

985
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,190
later on I couldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything later on</font>

986
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,650
yeah I'm more interested in getting your

987
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,300
feedback for everybody this will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

988
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,620
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your review don't worry about this is</font>

989
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,100
Joe he's our boss yeah you've hit for us

990
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be okay during the course of your</font>

991
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:25,100
testing and analysis other than the one

992
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">hash get ruleset did you find any others</font>

993
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,799
that were more efficient yet that

994
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,220
extended what you were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

995
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the targeted list and what would</font>

996
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,500
those rules be for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of us so we</font>

997
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,270
use three different rules but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

998
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that those two</font>

999
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:48,050
the rule sets existed in this hobo 64

1000
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:50,209
real set so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we used rule one rule which</font>

1001
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:54,950
contains five thousand rules and we used

1003
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,960
dead hobo real set so we do also have

1004
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,330
metrics on that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can post out to</font>

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,240
Twitter or<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the github repo but</font>

collective 58,000 rules of that just

1008
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:13,130
sort of encompassed all this I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1009
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,370
to say that it looks incredibly useful

1010
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:19,160
and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to make it</font>

1011
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:22,339
work in other countries and particularly

1012
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,000
the UK we were we would love for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1013
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,290
help us do that yeah anyway you know so

1014
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,350
well what you people go against<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter</font>

1015
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:35,950
you hello leo<font color="#CCCCCC"> put some points on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

1016
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:38,180
tweak it for the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> or for our country</font>

1017
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,009
yeah that's a really good point i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font>

1018
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,690
the I was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netherlands and and</font>

1019
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,200
also in the UK recently doing a pen test

1020
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,520
and I kind of showed this to some of the

1021
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,810
clients I was working with and just told

1022
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,759
him to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check out the talk at their time</font>

1023
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:52,370
they mentioned the same thing and that

1024
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,870
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Tom and I were speaking about</font>

1025
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,080
that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we kind of</font>

1026
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,160
extrapolated and made it modular now so

1027
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,350
we hope to build on that and hopefully

1028
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,190
there could be a UK based implementation

1029
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:09,830
in wordsmith too I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if this</font>

1030
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:11,960
was comfort but so mass processing so if

1031
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:13,850
you want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> like show me all</font>

1032
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,770
passwords to have capital their length

1033
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:19,850
12 and all that stuff was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that covered</font>

1034
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:22,100
in this version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst myth so</font>

1035
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:25,310
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a forgery so you may have you</font>

1036
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:28,549
put up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your yeah there is a feature to</font>

1037
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,440
specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> omentum character lengths there</font>

1038
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,000
is a feature to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know convert to a lower</font>

1039
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,500
case by default it's going to come out

1040
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,900
as capital cases how we pull it out of

1041
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the HTML sources but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can massage the</font>

1042
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,540
data to a degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah we set the</font>

1043
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,540
state here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> California</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Z is or z is</font>

1044
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,160
for the zip codes and k is for the

1045
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,360
character length so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

1046
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,350
password policies if your organization

1047
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,060
has a minimum of<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven we could specify</font>

1048
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:55,120
seven here we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the zip</font>

1049
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,040
codes have five characters

1050
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're string so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we specify a</font>

1051
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,180
minimum length of three we're still

1052
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get all the zip codes for we're</font>

1053
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,089
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the zip codes five</font>

1054
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,890
we're going to all the zip codes but if

1055
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> set it for six we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

1056
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">any and we're just drilling down on zip</font>

1057
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,850
codes here if we went for all which is

1058
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,070
every single option available in

1059
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,720
wordsmith<font color="#E5E5E5"> and set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for six you'll see</font>

1060
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,910
that will churn through everything every

1061
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,709
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> road every single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City landmark</font>

1062
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,899
zip code area code whatever that is

1063
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:30,670
under that six character specification

1064
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:32,320
will be removed from the word list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1065
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just curious since you mentioned sports</font>

1066
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">teams and I've seen a lot of users</font>

1067
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,670
definitely sports teams um if you use

1068
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:42,040
cruel um to do like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIFA website</font>

1069
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,320
would that be able to scrub those team

1070
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,980
names or would we have to manually enter

1071
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:51,430
them because soccer is huge at least in

1072
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,690
the Bay Area so absolutely give me 10

1073
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,100
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the talk and I'll answer</font>

1074
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,990
that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you because we'll do</font>

1075
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,100
it together well type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIFA calm and</font>

1076
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,200
we'll see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets some sort names</font>

1077
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,240
yeah yeah one of the things I've been

1078
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling a man a man in temperature over</font>

1079
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,959
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password as well is that if you</font>

1080
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:10,540
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a student looking for an assignment</font>

1081
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,460
something to do or if you are security

1082
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,650
researcher and you for some magical

1083
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,480
reason actually have spare time please

1084
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,040
feel free to contact me and I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1085
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,380
your life a<font color="#CCCCCC"> living hell for next ten</font>

1086
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,910
years we have to work to do you know I

1087
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,460
have lots of things that I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1088
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,339
see being big research and one of the

1089
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,200
things I'm looking still looking for is

1090
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,760
and that's also the reason for why i

1091
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,410
asked you know why did you initially

1092
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,570
start doing this one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1093
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in doing and I'm</font>

1094
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,340
kind of asking around if this could

1095
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:42,040
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done at all I would like to</font>

1096
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">see somebody make a tool or some kind of</font>

1097
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:50,050
you know thing to pretty much put words

1098
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,550
the base<font color="#CCCCCC"> word of passwords that we can</font>

1099
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:55,720
find from leaks into different

1100
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:59,710
categories so as an example house or car

1101
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:02,830
is a physical object one dream or anger

1102
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:04,369
is not something physical so my question

1103
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:08,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">is could we</font>

1104
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:10,700
analyze password leaks or password from

1105
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:13,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">hell tests</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and categorize them and</font>

1106
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:15,109
because I'm interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in looking to you</font>

1107
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,970
know what kind of categories are worse

1108
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:19,999
of people actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using when it created</font>

1109
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:23,480
passwords one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i have done</font>

1110
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:28,868
is i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed passwords based on</font>

1111
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:32,019
gender & facial here and hair color<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1112
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:35,180
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have statistics on that</font>

1113
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:38,859
women with red hair right here have the

1114
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:42,379
best passwords and guys that looks like

1115
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:47,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">unix viewers have the absolute worst</font>

1116
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:48,619
passwords I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence of that but</font>

1117
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,630
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious about that so if</font>

1118
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:53,390
somebody is interested in in work to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1119
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,970
you know give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a call and with that I</font>

1120
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:58,038
will say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are going to do a 10</font>

1121
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,919
minute break before we go move on to the

1122
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:03,910
next speaker so again kanji and top it

1123
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font>
