00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,150
automating security with the OAuth

I'm Alan Robertson and this is about a

13
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,660
open source project which is recently

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,430
affiliated itself with a wasp it it has

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,959
security aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and non security</font>

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,180
aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so you might hear of it</font>

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,559
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP assimilation project you</font>

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,269
might hear it as just the assimilation

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,030
project and a little about me I spent a

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,370
long time in IT coming up on 40 years

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,469
actually and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I founded the Linux</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H a</font>

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,570
project or pacemaker people here heard

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,460
of pacemaker for a failover or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux HJ</font>

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,729
i founded that project ran it for about

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,339
10 years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started this project in</font>

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:17,509
2010 inspired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by some work I was doing</font>

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:19,409
for the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a 2.2 million core</font>

28
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,420
supercomputer and it was not a normal

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,450
cluster it had one clock for everything

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,740
it wasn't like a bunch of machines

31
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,299
operating separately and started making

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,399
me think about scale in a way I'd never

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,070
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it before and that's what</font>

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,350
prompted me to start this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project and I</font>

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,990
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company around this in 2013</font>

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,490
after IBM showed me an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8,000 of my</font>

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,079
closest<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the door all at once</font>

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,298
and I'm worked at bell labs for 21 years

39
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,199
worked for Souza for a year and IBM for

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,710
13 years or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so let's</font>

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,130
go on listen so as you think about

42
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,139
security how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

43
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,280
easy to get good security staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you</font>

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,000
think Security's going to get better

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
anytime soon

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,348
do you think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough staff if</font>

47
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,090
people have switched to dev ops or agile

48
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,649
things you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's going to</font>

49
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">make your problems easier and you can be</font>

50
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,330
able to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that what's what's</font>

51
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:23,360
up with you guys what's up with you guys

52
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,580
right Oh experience there we go that's

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,709
it now something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that's true about</font>

54
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,630
me is sometimes I make claims which

55
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,640
seemed a little outrageous sometimes

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,959
people and I'm told they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you</font>

57
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,730
bring in they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let you bring in</font>

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,310
rotten tomatoes and eggs so I brought

59
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:42,738
some for you and so you folks can looks

60
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,410
that's the price shouldn't do over hand

61
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:50,660
throws<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hit people when I do that so</font>

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:52,400
yeah there we go so if the time comes

63
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,200
when you say you know I know why his

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,620
eyes are brown is full up to here with

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,959
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brown then you'll know</font>

66
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,370
what to do and I've I've never thought

67
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,290
about it before but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess what I did</font>

68
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,640
is armed the audience maybe that's not

69
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,640
such a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea at a security</font>

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,290
conference so let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things</font>

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,029
that happen here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

72
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,858
really well thirty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

73
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,519
break-ins come through systems that are

74
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:19,430
not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inventory oh we had that</font>

75
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,600
system why didn't know will we patch in

76
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,609
it no maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> not maybe not didn't know</font>

77
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,440
what was there ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font>

78
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:30,019
everybody has had failures of services

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,609
they're not monitoring and this is by

80
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way this statistic from James</font>

81
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,519
Turnbull comes from people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

82
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,649
running chef and puppet which are

83
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,170
bleeding edge compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font>

84
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,019
as a whole right that's as good as it

85
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets and if everybody isn't monitoring</font>

86
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,950
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the services you know they have 71</font>

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,048
percent of people once they get in

88
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,328
compliance with something like pci<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

89
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:54,230
year later we're not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance Oh</font>

90
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:56,060
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened I don't know thirty</font>

91
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,358
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people well we really only</font>

92
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,489
start monitoring things once they break

93
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:03,170
and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are of the best people in the</font>

94
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,489
industry right so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

95
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real world is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably worse than</font>

96
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">this yeah yeah exactly thirty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

97
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,510
systems aren't doing anything useful at

98
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,329
all but they are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice</font>

99
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,279
contribution to global warming there are

100
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,940
space heaters right there space heaters

101
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,039
are doing not

102
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,870
these are all other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's statistics</font>

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,030
which I have every reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe are</font>

104
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,010
reasonable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think you guys have</font>

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,330
seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same stuff yourself when I talk</font>

106
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to people who work in security they say</font>

107
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,750
yeah yeah but you shouldn't met my

108
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,160
customers you wouldn't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

109
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">did and they go on to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me something</font>

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do believe it unfortunately</font>

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,390
so a little about what this project is

112
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,969
for and I apologize for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of the</font>

113
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,950
oh that's not interesting that's it's

114
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,040
not there's some things not oh that's

115
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,440
interesting and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ottoman yeah so</font>

116
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,360
anyway sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your animation doesn't</font>

117
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,060
work right you know so we do things like

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,430
track IP and mac addresses validate

119
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,370
continuously validate configuration

120
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,310
against compliance rules we track

121
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:04,490
software versions we track check sums of

122
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,800
network facing processes monitor systems

123
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of statuses of services systems</font>

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,340
as servers and services score we produce

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,260
scores for your machines basically risk

126
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,900
scores you know it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> golf except</font>

127
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,430
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero in theory low</font>

128
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,880
score is better than a high score so you

129
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,990
can think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as correlated to risk</font>

130
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,940
sort of correlated to risk you know

131
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody is mechanical scoring is never</font>

132
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,490
who can agree on what the risk is anyway

133
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,470
but the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the low numbers</font>

134
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:40,220
are better than better than high numbers

135
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:41,300
right we also we also discovered the

136
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">same kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things for docker</font>

137
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,310
containers as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs and and VMS</font>

138
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,320
and bare metal and clouds we alert on

139
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,630
chain we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you alert on changes</font>

140
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,950
in configuration or status so that you

141
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,290
can actually be aware of when things

142
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,890
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do this in approximately</font>

143
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,780
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is to say</font>

144
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,210
within minutes to hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when the</font>

145
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,669
changes are made that that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

146
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,669
daily annually or quarterly that means

147
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,890
when they change and we do it with

148
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:15,590
basically near a zero configuration and

149
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,750
we do it without any pings or port scans

150
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,250
so you know it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad when you</font>

151
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a security tool that sets off your</font>

152
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,570
other security tools that's a bad thing

153
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,300
you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

154
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,430
your your other security tool in order

155
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,640
to security tool a to run to reveal to

156
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">run security tool be so this is what we</font>

157
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,120
do and we do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things together</font>

158
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a way that scales really well by</font>

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,650
scaling really well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean is like on</font>

160
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,970
the order of a hundred thousand systems

161
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,049
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when I make this kind of</font>

162
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,610
claims this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start</font>

163
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,970
thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe those eggs and</font>

164
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,800
tomatoes are good ideas we are

165
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,840
continuous discovery we did this to

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,640
continuous discovery which drives

167
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,979
everything and we and we create from

168
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:58,310
that configuration management database

169
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,510
similar logically similar to the graphs

170
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,950
that are passing around through the

171
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,750
audience now we have the discovery is

172
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,729
done in a way that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually do</font>

173
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,650
any network footprint to discover

174
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,780
anything now to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

175
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,979
discovery yeah we do that we do talk on

176
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,890
the network to do that you got to get

177
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data there somehow discovery though</font>

178
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,490
interestingly enough eliminates most

179
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,990
configuration it is not quite

180
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,780
configuration free but it's pretty close

181
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,979
to configuration free so the thing about

182
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,599
configuration how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when</font>

183
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,530
you configure stuff it stays configured

184
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,150
correctly forever no right oh it's that

185
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,179
experience thing you talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

186
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,950
it yeah so if it's configured

187
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:43,669
automatically it's more likely be

188
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">figured correctly we also drive best</font>

189
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:47,690
practice analysis which you could also

190
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,760
say is compliance analysis because which

191
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,469
fundamentally whether you call it

192
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,780
compliance or whether you call it best

193
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,310
practices the idea is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

194
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,380
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> some rules that you think are</font>

195
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,140
good ideas and when you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

196
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,240
to know whether that's an official audit

197
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,430
process or whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just good</font>

198
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,580
hygiene on your computer's I don't care

199
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,380
it comes to the same thing and people

200
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">say well that's just the basics okay</font>

201
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,300
most people don't do the basics very

202
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,950
well so let's start by doing the basics

203
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,250
well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do here</font>

204
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,740
and as I said we put it in a graph

205
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,330
database which basically means a graph

206
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,560
database is basically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you draw</font>

207
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,450
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board you have circles and arrows</font>

208
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,500
you know relational databases have

209
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,360
tables rows and columns in a graph

210
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,309
database you have nodes that have

211
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,199
attributes and relationships which are

212
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:37,229
the arrows that have attributes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

213
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:40,650
circles and arrows

214
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,789
in a database instead of tables the nice

215
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,559
thing about there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nice</font>

216
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,030
things about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't go into that</font>

217
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,229
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but it's at a graph database</font>

218
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,400
instead of a relational database so

219
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,310
scalability without a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra</font>

220
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,520
complexity you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just out of</font>

221
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the box discovery without pink is report</font>

222
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,230
scans how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think that sounds</font>

223
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,220
reasonable not like okay guys I guess I

224
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,590
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> said how many people think</font>

225
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't sound reasonable yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes I</font>

226
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like sounds like that but maybe this</font>

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,990
is a good opportunity for those tomatoes

228
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,459
and eggs but hang on a second here let's

229
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,890
look at the scalability aspect cuz it's

230
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,050
my favorite thing to talk about so I can

231
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,930
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we scale so that your</font>

232
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,260
grandmother<font color="#CCCCCC"> would understand even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

233
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,150
your grandmother isn't Grace Hopper so

234
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,590
at my church on Wednesday night we get

235
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,420
together for a meal we start on hold

236
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,040
hands like this you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

237
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,990
circle with our eyes closed and what

238
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,610
were there with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our eyes closed and the</font>

239
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,280
past is praying over our food if Aunt

240
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:42,030
Sally passes out who notices first in

241
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,800
this arrangement the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people holding</font>

242
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,360
your hands now for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to participate in</font>

243
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this human monitoring arrangement how</font>

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,180
many hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you have to have how many</font>

245
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,439
there we go to you have to have two

246
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,420
hands because everybody doesn't have

247
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,690
pretty much most people have two hands

248
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,030
and and so if i had a thousand people

249
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,840
that arrangement how many hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

250
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:08,610
have to have do you you have two

251
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,620
thousand hands oh my goodness the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

252
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,720
how many hands do you have to have you

253
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,030
have to have two hands right did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,650
work that anybody's work go up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

255
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,520
added<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand people to the</font>

256
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:22,260
arrangement nobody's work went up so

257
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's how we scale we have our</font>

258
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,910
computers hold hands well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok they're</font>

259
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,380
actually heartbeats but if you want to

260
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">get like really literal you can put your</font>

261
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,650
fingers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there on you know feel their</font>

262
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,360
heartbeats through their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands and</font>

263
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally what we're doing here</font>

264
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,380
we're exchanging heart beats with two

265
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,510
neighbors and now the interesting thing

266
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now if you have this kind of</font>

267
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,100
arrangement everyone is being monitored

268
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,709
by some by two other people so you can

269
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,570
reliably know if a machine goes away and

270
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,500
you can just sit back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wait for the</font>

271
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,070
phone to ring

272
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,660
for someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call 911 and you don't</font>

273
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,010
have to do anything at all because the

274
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,329
monitoring is all fully distributed

275
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:03,450
among the systems that are being

276
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:06,900
involved so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works that's</font>

277
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,730
the fundamentals<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how this scales the</font>

278
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,130
way it does and once you have the

279
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,100
scalability then with agents everything

280
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,660
else falls out because most of the time

281
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,270
een you can have a system how do you

282
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like to change systems or</font>

283
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,650
is it more that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people when you screw</font>

284
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,569
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you mess up up right people</font>

285
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,670
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave them alone so once you've</font>

286
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,920
told us your configuration we only get

287
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,599
notified<font color="#CCCCCC"> about changes which means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

288
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,400
we might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a machine we haven't heard</font>

289
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">from phone at all for a year but we know</font>

290
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what its configuration is that</font>

291
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,900
we know it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed because we</font>

292
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,970
have a reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of knowing if that</font>

293
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,819
changes through our agents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if our</font>

294
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,340
agent goes away then the two neighbor

295
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,700
agents complain that it's dead so we'll

296
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:53,940
know it's a nice reliable way of doing

297
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:57,150
it's no news is good news but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

298
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,740
reliable at the same time which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort</font>

299
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,260
of contradictory but it's actually works

300
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,850
that way so a little about the

301
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,290
architecture here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're going</font>

302
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a demo here in a minute let's see</font>

303
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,170
how far I am into this I'm about 12

304
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,460
minutes in so there's a central system

305
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,599
called the collective<font color="#CCCCCC"> Management</font>

306
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Authority this is the assimilation</font>

307
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,830
project and yes we have nanoprobes we

308
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,000
inject your machines with so that they

309
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,490
can be assimilated and join the

310
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,140
collective those of you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Star</font>

311
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,580
Trek might not appreciate the joke and

312
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,580
the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you maybe groaning that's</font>

313
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,580
okay I'm okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with bad jokes</font>

314
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:38,310
they're here somewhere not bad bad jokes

315
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,189
don't count just if I'm full of brown

316
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:44,459
stuff other over here so I did actually

317
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,410
collect an egg once but I deserved it I

318
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,850
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drew it you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you can</font>

319
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,290
draw a foul<font color="#E5E5E5"> I drew an egg so we have</font>

320
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,610
nanoprobes which of the agents on all

321
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,310
the machines which then do the

322
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,780
heartbeats and and then do the discovery

323
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,400
and do the monitoring and send

324
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,579
everything to the central<font color="#E5E5E5"> server but</font>

325
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,800
only when it changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> only when it</font>

326
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,630
changes and the nanoprobes are written

327
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,579
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> c the central</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server is written in</font>

329
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,860
through you is called neo4j which

330
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,060
happens to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in Java I don't</font>

331
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,440
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good care I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it over rest</font>

332
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,839
here that some kind of analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

333
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,480
reports we provide comparison against

334
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,980
best practice hardening rules they

335
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,590
default from a project called the IT

336
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,510
best practices project which is an open

337
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,000
source project whose purpose is to

338
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,290
collect particularly hardening type

339
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,270
rules things you can observe

340
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,110
mechanically which people think are a

341
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:42,329
good idea to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in compliance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

342
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,960
current most most of the rules they were

343
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,300
taken from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DISA sticks which are</font>

344
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,770
mostly good rules some of the

345
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,810
implementations of them sometimes people

346
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,819
have a bad but they're mostly pretty

347
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,560
good rules might be a little excessive

348
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,680
but you know there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

349
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,540
wrong with them either unknown IP

350
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,589
addresses no it's what IP addresses are

351
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,770
out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know what they</font>

352
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">are we bought it through services as</font>

353
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,140
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I've met to this and we</font>

354
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,780
can tell you what services are

355
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,199
unmonitored and we do a triage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll let</font>

356
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you so imagine that you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

357
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,400
let's say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example for the DISA</font>

358
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,620
sticks there's about 250 rules for a

359
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,030
linux box and the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines going</font>

360
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,100
to fail about a hundred of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

361
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,390
the out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the out of the box so if you</font>

362
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,890
have a thousand machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> and each one</font>

363
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">has 100 failures you have a hundred</font>

364
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:31,650
thousand failures so now you will need a

365
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,870
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of approaching this to let you eat</font>

366
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:37,410
this elephant in a rational reasonable

367
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,410
way so we provide a scoring system at a

368
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,579
triage sort order in facially it says

369
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,899
here's the machines with the most

370
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,999
problems or

371
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,529
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer here are the areas and</font>

372
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,420
rules that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most problem across</font>

373
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:49,559
all the machines and you can do it

374
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,550
either way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course you provide you</font>

375
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,430
the information you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the way</font>

376
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,290
we sort it sort at your own way but

377
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,019
that's the idea of it if we want to help

378
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,360
you manage that process and then you can

379
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,550
graph the total score and see how it's

380
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,199
going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time because if you</font>

381
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,179
don't intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on fixing this you actually</font>

382
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,399
don't want to know what what ways you're

383
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,929
not compliant you only want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

384
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan on fixing it because otherwise</font>

385
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,670
it looks like you know when lawsuits

386
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,139
come and there becomes disclosure and

387
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,998
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to show that</font>

388
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going down not that it's going up</font>

389
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:21,660
or staying flat you want to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

390
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,939
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your job but the good thing</font>

391
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,300
is now you can many people think they

392
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:28,980
have managers that like graph yeah so we

393
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,420
can do a graph that lets them show how

394
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,610
you're actually getting your job done

395
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,229
well which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's a good thing</font>

396
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">right but by by by root you can</font>

397
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">eliminate rules yet that that sometimes</font>

398
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,920
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right answer but you can also</font>

399
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:46,259
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> by actually fixing the problems i</font>

400
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,769
mean i know that's a radical idea but

401
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:54,929
you could actually fix the problems but

402
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:56,639
and so anyway a little more in the best

403
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,980
practice analysis they're triggered by

404
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,730
discovery updates and we don't evaluate

405
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,779
them daily weekly quarterly or annually

406
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,490
we evaluate them when something changes

407
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:10,980
gosh<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't it isn't that interesting</font>

408
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,870
in other words you know almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

409
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,269
away that something has changed and then

410
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,079
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you either got better or</font>

411
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,670
you got worse when that happened right

412
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,620
you can discover more or less<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

413
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,269
you want writing a discovery agent

414
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,309
basically means whatever domain you want

415
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:32,249
to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example maybe Pam rules</font>

416
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:34,110
maybe praxis maybe login<font color="#E5E5E5"> se login depths</font>

417
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:37,110
whatever you write a script that spits

418
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,569
that transforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON which is</font>

419
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,279
not rocket science and you then you

420
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:42,719
teach us<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it is and we run it for</font>

421
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,119
you and we keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to date in the</font>

422
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,160
database not hard then if you want to

423
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:48,360
write rules based on that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can or if</font>

424
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,040
you just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the database</font>

425
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can query it there you go it's</font>

426
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,829
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as I said there are alerts and</font>

427
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,480
various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reports available</font>

428
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,010
and and here's some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we want</font>

429
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,260
to do in the future because<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

430
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,340
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo I get carried away so i</font>

431
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,930
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you this because i don't</font>

432
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,550
want to forget this we want to

433
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,109
coordinate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> security vendor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> updates</font>

434
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,000
so for example when Red Hat comes out

435
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,770
with a new patch we want to then ding

436
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,170
the security scores of all the machines

437
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,209
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vulnerability and not</font>

438
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,490
unpatched vulnerability and of course we

439
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,970
because the way discovery works once you

440
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,609
apply the patch then then that score

441
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:26,010
would go back up because that's

442
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,958
integrated into the process as well what

443
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we know what package is</font>

444
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,330
you have on the machines we just don't

445
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,840
currently update the security score

446
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,340
based on that we ought to so we want to

447
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">do interesting things with checksums we</font>

448
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,179
currently collect to check sums on

449
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,890
everything that's network facing we you

450
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,030
know of course then going to your

451
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,190
vendors and getting whitelist and

452
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,389
bringing them in that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

453
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">blacklist for some things that's a good</font>

454
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,090
thing and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other things we can</font>

455
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">do because we have it all in one place</font>

456
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can do what I call minority reports</font>

457
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,600
which is to say did you know you have 99

458
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,900
copies of this library they're the same

459
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,870
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's different oh maybe that's</font>

460
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,890
not a good thing right or maybe it is a

461
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,550
good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

462
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:08,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hacked but it's something</font>

463
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,190
worth looking into in any case and and

464
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,650
we want to integrate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sims and we'd</font>

465
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,770
like to do some role based access

466
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:18,480
controls on on the on some of the

467
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,520
queries so that you can do this more in

468
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,660
in an environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> where it you don't</font>

469
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be a security person to be</font>

470
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,720
allowed to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this data so that</font>

471
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,580
people can see the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

472
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,530
appropriate to them according to their

473
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,939
role and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I want to ask you</font>

474
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,820
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think about this and I want</font>

475
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,070
to invite your input it's what else

476
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,330
should we be doing right imagine you

477
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,980
could know anything you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

478
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,300
about your systems and then then<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

479
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,040
would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know and what would</font>

480
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do with it what would you do about</font>

481
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,260
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and so that's kind of our</font>

482
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,850
that's the space we play in here the

483
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,800
question is what's interesting to you

484
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,570
because it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think's</font>

485
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,610
interesting nobody cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think</font>

486
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:59,580
what matters is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think what</font>

487
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:02,340
matters is what you think so a little

488
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,129
about the demo that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this demo</font>

489
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,720
everything is discovered nothing at all

490
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,500
is configured manual I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

491
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,880
it where to find the central server it

492
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,250
happens to be on the same machine

493
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,350
because that makes a demo easier but it

494
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,500
doesn't have to be it just it discovers

495
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,689
that as well we will show you things

496
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that need hardening show you I'll talk</font>

497
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,690
to show you walk you through the process

498
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:29,560
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort order looks like for</font>

499
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:31,180
the triaging of problems how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

500
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">visual I'll do love visualization of an</font>

501
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,500
attack surface because I know all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

502
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,130
know all the services you offer again

503
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,690
know what ports are on and instead of

504
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,040
graph database so it's natural to be

505
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,710
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visualize some of these things</font>

506
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,450
and i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demo of what</font>

507
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,270
packages and versions are on machines

508
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,630
and and I don't put a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr.</font>

509
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,400
discovery well I may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running a</font>

510
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,280
doctor instance right now so if I'm not

511
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,620
it won't discover it because I don't

512
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,970
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I set that up this morning so but</font>

513
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:12,459
it would if I had it running so so the

514
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:16,840
demo now do this and go over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

515
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:22,120
so i have a cleverly named script called

516
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:25,199
demo and it'll wipe out the database oh

517
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,199
yeah rights to do

518
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,740
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going through here this</font>

519
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:40,070
thing is back to not working very well

520
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh but anyway doesn't matter up here at</font>

521
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,970
the top it says erase DB run into

522
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,940
foreground so we started it up it's

523
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,190
going in the foreground we've now it's

524
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,690
it says in the resetting connection that

525
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,900
means that it's now gotten a connection

526
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,940
from one of its agents right and now

527
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,800
it's starting to do discovery it is

528
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,390
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what rules it's failing here</font>

529
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,540
this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> first discovery is of</font>

530
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">Etsy audit decomp and it's saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

531
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,710
we passed some rules and failed some

532
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,970
rules and the security IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says nif</font>

533
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,680
those are actually DISA Stig identifiers

534
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll show you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you</font>

535
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,040
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that goes with that in</font>

536
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,900
just a minute and now we're effective

537
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,920
valuating some best practice rules on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sh</font>

538
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">t sh HD configuration and we passed some</font>

539
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,950
we fail some and this is all happening

540
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,150
as the discovery comes in actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

541
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,740
deliberately kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> slowed the</font>

542
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,060
discovery coming in so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you start</font>

543
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,220
up a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of machines at once we don't</font>

544
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,970
get flooded so much it you know spreads

545
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:41,480
it out over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

546
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:44,930
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to some things where are</font>

547
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we here file and directory attributes</font>

548
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:55,370
and we're passing some and failing some

549
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:59,150
and so in this in this case by the way

550
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:01,520
this failure here was on it says that

551
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,880
one of the shadow files was readable by

552
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,960
group be able to anyways it doesn't like

553
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,080
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I don't remember</font>

554
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,120
exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on here and it</font>

555
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,770
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's doing discovery on this set</font>

556
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,439
of attributes that set of attributes

557
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:18,379
this set of files and so on and it

558
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,420
continues on through here now and it

559
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,670
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> says here about some services are</font>

560
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,200
now operational so once it's discovered

561
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,670
what services the machine is offering

562
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,710
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going out and monitoring</font>

563
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,170
those services as well it says well you

564
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,850
know I see you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neo4j why</font>

565
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't I just monitor it for you I see</font>

566
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,300
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running sshd why don't I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

567
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,590
monitor it for you so it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

568
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,560
kind of stuff here it's coming down

569
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">through here and the last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is come</font>

570
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,500
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with here</font>

571
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,840
is now I did a tail on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya a tail on I</font>

572
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,399
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I have to go over here</font>

573
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,590
yeah so I did it see this is in that

574
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:57,989
this is a tale of syslog so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

575
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,350
in there it's got it it's got a URL into

576
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT best practices not info project</font>

577
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,740
people in the back kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see that I</font>

578
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:12,029
hope a little bit but if you open<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

579
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:18,230
up open think I'm not sure quite where

580
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:23,909
my browser is it's in the wrong window

581
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:26,600
let's put it over here no I don't want

582
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,600
you to restore<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

583
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,570
so people in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back can kind of see</font>

584
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,820
that too so it tells you that this is a

585
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,889
medium severity problem and you're not

586
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,409
supposed to send icmp v4 redirects<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

587
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,390
default and it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to explain it in</font>

588
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,060
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail and how to check if</font>

589
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,190
it's correct and if you continue on a

590
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">little further it then tells you how to</font>

591
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,500
fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because actually checking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

592
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,960
this value<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like is value equal to 0</font>

593
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,180
right that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of code</font>

594
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,480
but the explanation for it is a lot

595
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,030
harder it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you</font>

596
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,800
don't know what these rules mean or what

597
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,290
their significance is you're probably

598
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to fix them right and so that</font>

599
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tying of these two together I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

600
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,910
makes it much much more useful and this

601
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,620
basically is the fundamental of what the

602
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,170
ID best practices project is is this

603
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of information right and it there's</font>

604
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,110
a website for it then there's there's a

605
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,679
source control under github and it's an

606
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,939
open source project right and there are

607
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,650
a few rules though that don't come from

608
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,480
disis digs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've written and</font>

609
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,890
actually doesn't have to be all security

610
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,110
rules is actually one networking rule

611
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,000
too but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the idea of what this</font>

612
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,290
does now let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and see what some</font>

613
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,200
of the other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

614
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,560
and the demo here is oh yeah this this

615
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,560
is cool

616
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:57,800
so let's make this bigger oh yeah it did

617
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,210
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger I went on to something</font>

618
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:06,260
else that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right file what did</font>

619
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to the next file I'm</font>

620
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,379
not sure exactly how i did that so let's

621
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,379
get rid of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

622
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:21,560
view zoom in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so diff oh it's on my</font>

623
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:27,230
screen but not on yours oh let's put it

624
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this is a</font>

625
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,670
visualization of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack surface for</font>

626
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,199
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and I'll see if I</font>

627
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,520
can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it would be a lot</font>

628
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">better if this thing we're working other</font>

629
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,570
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working now it's not working</font>

630
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">again oh no this is the one that work</font>

631
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,370
better that's why it's up here yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

632
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">so this is the this is the system this</font>

633
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a representation of the system itself</font>

634
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:50,480
you see it's in bold red and it says we

635
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a risk score of 57 the way the risk</font>

636
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,980
score is calculated is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a low</font>

637
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,870
priority violation it's worth one point

638
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,640
medium priority is worth two points is

639
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:05,090
anybody going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guess what high</font>

640
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,620
priority is<font color="#CCCCCC"> three so we have a total</font>

641
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">button and that's why it's red is</font>

642
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,360
because it has it you know basically

643
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,250
illustrates it a bolder and bolder up to

644
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,510
a certain point and and of course you

645
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,950
don't have any it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be black and</font>

646
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:20,360
thin right rather than bold and red so

647
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,580
now let's decided to stop working again

648
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,030
I need to replace the batteries before I

649
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,939
got here I guess but so this is so what

650
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:32,990
we have here are a bunch of different

651
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a java program Dropbox</font>

652
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,110
now it's unfortunately it scrolled off

653
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,670
the screen here<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

654
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:47,840
scroll it I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

655
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:50,330
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so sshd is reading here as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

656
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,350
now this looks like either i had a bug

657
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:58,370
in oh this is an old version of this

658
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:01,100
file that's the problem this should be

659
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">read and in fact in the current version</font>

660
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the software it is I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I cash this</font>

661
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,760
file because it takes a little while and

662
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,070
run so this sshd which is listening on

663
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,170
the these IP port combinations this is

664
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,450
Dropbox which is both talking out and

665
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,300
outbound connection to dropbox here and

666
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:21,740
an inbound connection to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

667
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:24,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">other people on dropbox RPC bind this is</font>

668
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">neo4j and i was apparently running vino</font>

669
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,820
server at this time as well like I said

670
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,429
this is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what happened to</font>

671
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version I had here that was oh right</font>

672
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this is a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

673
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,980
visualization which I can't show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

674
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:42,740
because it's too it's too it's not bold

675
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,810
enough so anyway the idea is that these

676
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,360
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various these are the IP ports</font>

677
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,800
that people can get in that you're

678
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">offering services on up here are the IP</font>

679
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,950
ports for services were requesting

680
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:56,360
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so anyway this is this is</font>

681
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,780
an ideal show you an idea what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

682
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:05,959
visualization looks like let's let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

683
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:09,320
on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else sure this is a good</font>

684
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:14,780
one so let's look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the packages on</font>

685
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:19,810
the machine and if I can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back over</font>

686
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,810
here get rid of this

687
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,220
ok

688
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,960
maybe I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

689
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:38,190
apparently I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at mousing</font>

690
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:47,600
there we go so let's get rid of this now

691
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's go go here control shift V</font>

692
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,889
so this is a query<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all the packages</font>

693
00:28:50,190 --> 00:29:00,420
on all the machines so that's so what we

694
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:03,480
have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this machine system76 has</font>

695
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,650
a package<font color="#E5E5E5"> called ubuntu one client data</font>

696
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean this is just some of the examples</font>

697
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,160
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on here that's all the</font>

698
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,900
packages and all that you see the

699
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,100
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there too and what</font>

700
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,670
kind of pack these happen to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pip</font>

701
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,909
packages it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> pip packages RPM</font>

702
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,790
package<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb packages and so on right all</font>

703
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:24,480
the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of packaging in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

704
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:28,590
Jas packages and so on and and you can

705
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:36,000
also query for specific packages we go

706
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:37,470
back here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find this again so let's</font>

707
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the database i'm</font>

708
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,280
using here right

709
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,290
and now I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back with one answer</font>

710
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,460
p<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel is it people to the back can</font>

711
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,760
see that but it basically says<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

712
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,950
running version 3 dot 0 dot 4 of neo4j

713
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,050
so we have this stuff in the database

714
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,240
whenever it's updated the database is

715
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,040
updated on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff and lots</font>

716
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,930
of other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things as well these</font>

717
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:08,480
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple examples of the kind of</font>

718
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:12,260
stuff the kind of things that the kind

719
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,970
of things that the kind of things that

720
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,150
that you can have in the day in the

721
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,160
database here as I said it concludes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb</font>

722
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:23,390
packages<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpm packages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> python pip</font>

723
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:29,240
packages rubygems PHP packages and no

724
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,740
Jas NPM packages you can do others as

725
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,830
well it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do those</font>

726
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:36,530
and this is as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before an open</font>

727
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:43,669
source project and let's see what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

728
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:45,860
have time to do maybe one more oh yeah

729
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:54,080
this let's do one of these so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

730
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:56,780
at the most critical problems that we

731
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">have from an overall perspective and</font>

732
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll explain this I talk to you about</font>

733
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:11,440
triaging before so what we have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

734
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom this is this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing i</font>

735
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,470
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should have just gotten fresh</font>

736
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,600
batteries but if you look here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font>

737
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,890
to have to come and next to it sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

738
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,320
you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this is the head at the</font>

739
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,770
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it says here that process</font>

740
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,530
accounts to 16 points on this machine

741
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,900
and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the rules by order or how</font>

742
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,360
much the individual rule costs you and

743
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,990
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that cost the most is</font>

744
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,729
pam cold and and and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on the</font>

745
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,890
idea is if you wanted to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to</font>

746
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,780
attack you'd want to attack the things

747
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,940
where you have the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> bang for your</font>

748
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,040
buck and that means let's go learn how

749
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,990
praxis rules work and how we set them up

750
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,639
so we'll go investigate that look at the

751
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">praxis rules look at these particular</font>

752
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,240
rules starting from here come to

753
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,710
understand them fix them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

754
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,520
distribute them out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you do</font>

755
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,080
you'll get your big

756
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,950
bang for your buck then you can attack

757
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,379
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pam rules and so on down the line it</font>

758
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,240
gives you a way of attacking it to help

759
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,200
you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix all</font>

760
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:13,250
these problems so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic idea</font>

761
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,450
of what we do here and is this making

762
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,250
sense to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and and and as I said we</font>

763
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,320
do the rules we do all these different

764
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,180
kind of things that's really it's a it's

765
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,710
a very broad project perhaps overly

766
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:32,270
ambitious it could be not a not a not an

767
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:37,910
unfair comment let's see where my

768
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:40,720
where's my mouse control shift<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 no</font>

769
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,720
funky shift 5

770
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,500
f5<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

771
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:59,150
oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going the wrong way oops okay</font>

772
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,149
come on I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

773
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,920
now I went too far

774
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:11,450
so alone to summarize what we're talking

775
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:13,460
about here this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know more about your</font>

776
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:17,480
systems than you do anybody here think

777
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,909
that security is like warfare yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> sunzu</font>

778
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,889
says if you know yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

779
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:24,260
your enemy you need not<font color="#CCCCCC"> fear the result</font>

780
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a hundred battles we help you know</font>

781
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself like nobody else we know more</font>

782
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your systems than you do the your</font>

783
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,049
admins do in every anyone knows we can

784
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:35,178
discover anything you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

785
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:38,000
discovery keeps everything up to date

786
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,429
more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> less quasi real-time best</font>

787
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,720
practice auditing of course is is is

788
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:43,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">this best practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> auditing is</font>

789
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,980
continuous it's not quarterly annually

790
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:47,299
or whatever our scoring system as i

791
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,200
mentioned helps you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

792
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:52,490
result how to attack your problems

793
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,840
discovery includes it has near zero

794
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,929
configuration this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just summary of</font>

795
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,370
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is cool about it we include</font>

796
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,799
docker containers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our discovery</font>

797
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,719
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> monetary servers and services for</font>

798
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,490
good measure so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your sis</font>

799
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,590
admin staff getting value out of it this

800
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,239
helps you give more value to encourage

801
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:09,980
them to you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to use it</font>

802
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody to work from the same</font>

803
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,270
playbook of what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these systems for</font>

804
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:18,799
real system includes we have an event

805
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">api it says they'll let you know when</font>

806
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,619
things happen so you can you know

807
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,290
trigger whatever events you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook it</font>

808
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:26,750
into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell into custom scripts</font>

809
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:31,069
whatever and it scales and unusually

810
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:33,800
well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is a little bit</font>

811
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:36,679
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little more about this if</font>

812
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,000
you go to a category getting started it

813
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,359
will show you walk through four

814
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,980
different places you can that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can go</font>

815
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find out how to get started with this</font>

816
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,879
and so see some similarly demos<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

817
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,609
some demos online as well these are in

818
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,770
the slides slide deck of course the idea

819
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:54,589
is get assembly to try this out give it

820
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:59,200
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot and contribute to it and of</font>

821
00:34:54,589 --> 00:35:02,200
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistance is futile questions</font>

822
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
yes

823
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:08,529
the overhead on your agent so the agent

824
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight the question is what's the</font>

825
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:16,300
overhead on the agent and the answer is

826
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:18,190
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is written in c and and its footprint</font>

827
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,120
is measured in megabytes not gigabytes

828
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:25,150
and be so so that depends on how often

829
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,470
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check these things it's</font>

830
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">still in the measured in the you know a</font>

831
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,759
handful of percentages in the worst case

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,470
you know like 12 percent something like

833
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,510
that it can be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that if you</font>

834
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,759
want it's a question of if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

835
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,170
problem make it check less often you

836
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,420
know right now we're currently having a

837
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,530
check in the intervals of seconds but

838
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,540
you can have it check on intervals of

839
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,280
minutes how often do you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

840
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,350
these things what's the frequency that

841
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,140
matters to you then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said it</font>

842
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,190
accordingly does that make sense it's

843
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:59,529
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good answer but it's the best</font>

844
00:35:51,190 --> 00:36:01,180
i can give you this is this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

845
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,530
small and lightweight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> agent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

846
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:07,149
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run across I've been i</font>

847
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:10,060
perfectly understand that give it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font>

848
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:13,800
and tell me what your feedback is more

849
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions blue in the back</font>

850
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,620
right so one of the things we if we're

851
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,170
running on on real or virtual machines

852
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,759
but not clouds we can we also listen for

853
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,960
art packets so we know all the IP

854
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,720
addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac addresses of</font>

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,070
everything on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> subnets and that goes</font>

856
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,299
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database that's a query that I</font>

857
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,910
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you because</font>

858
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:40,560
we don't have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> time yes question</font>

859
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:42,330
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two questions there's a window</font>

860
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,750
sport in progress but it's I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

861
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,069
what when it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get done the</font>

862
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,900
answer so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is there</font>

863
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,300
windows client the answer is it was the

864
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,050
architected to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows</font>

865
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,550
implementation for the beginning and I

866
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,110
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody working on a piece of it I</font>

867
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:02,550
don't know how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to get</font>

868
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:04,860
done it's open source come help me my

869
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,280
stuff oh absolutely so let me make

870
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,230
something clear what this database it is

871
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,990
the buried treasure map for your

872
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,550
environment right totally understand

873
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but I've been aware of that for</font>

874
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,240
the beginning and that's all you can

875
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">really do the point is if you put make</font>

876
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,160
valuable information the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

877
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:30,300
valuable right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

878
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:32,250
it we did them so ever all the

879
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,480
communication is encrypted with a public

880
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,220
key encryption you we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

881
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's obviously a complicated</font>

882
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,270
question and it's a good one to discuss

883
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,770
here I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been given a lot of thought</font>

884
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,620
and I've done what I think I know to do

885
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,550
and certainly happy to hear more input

886
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,109
let's go on though if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all right</font>

887
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,370
for right now I would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

888
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,370
that some more yes you

889
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,500
so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> heartbeats that UDP</font>

890
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,480
heartbeats and the communication with

891
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the central server is also UDP but the</font>

892
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,200
stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unit central server is</font>

893
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:10,150
authenticated encrypted compressed blah

894
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:14,740
blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and and a with public key</font>

895
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,750
encryption they don't discover each

896
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,459
other they wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hello where I</font>

897
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,560
am the central server<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok here's</font>

898
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">your here's your neighbors because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

899
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know about them so while we're</font>

900
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:28,750
talking to them we tell them where to

901
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're to splice into the ring in the</font>

902
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:35,880
back in the very back yeah this got the

903
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:43,950
gut yeah with the hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a little beard</font>

904
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:47,650
sorry it's like having to describe it is

905
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:52,839
I didn't hear the question I heard about

906
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:54,970
common checks does it use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cap</font>

907
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,290
content or did you pull out like a small

908
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">subset of common checks between the</font>

909
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,400
different well well first of all we have

910
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> checks we have which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not all we</font>

911
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,840
want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the checks we're currently</font>

912
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:08,980
doing it mostly based off the NIST<font color="#CCCCCC"> DISA</font>

913
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,630
Stig's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there has to be</font>

914
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,280
mechanically observable I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

915
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,940
observe whether somebody signed a paper

916
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,320
log coming into the data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

917
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right one more question one more</font>

918
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,910
question in the beard there

919
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,480
that's just heart beats with there's no

920
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,310
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it other than I'm alive and</font>

921
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,690
because the key that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

922
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,110
distribution problem with that is just

923
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:41,230
horror fake so we don't do it it's just

924
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,840
we trust at that level we provide that

925
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,900
level of trust for free and yeah you can

926
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,160
spoof it the problem with when you screw

927
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,950
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the monitoring system you're likely</font>

928
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,210
to get observed it's not the it's not

929
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing you usually want to screw with</font>

930
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,870
if you're an attacker because if you do

931
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,189
it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do it right you're</font>

932
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get observed because it's the</font>

933
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of this system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to observe you all</font>

934
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,879
right think thanks much for your time

935
