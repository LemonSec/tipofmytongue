00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay our speaker this evening is Andrea</font>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">scarfo security analyst at opendns 12</font>

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,340
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got her teeth as a</font>

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,469
sysadmin and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's a malware hunter</font>

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,469
so please give a warm welcome to Andrea

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:24,330
thank you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear me okay okay yeah so</font>

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,220
the first security conference that I

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,288
ever attended was actually a b-sides in

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,769
San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now this is my first</font>

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,770
time presenting in at bsides again so go

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,750
besides so the title<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the talk in</font>

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,489
involving evolving era of botnet empires

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,739
just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about myself again I'm</font>

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,218
an analyst on the security research team

15
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,718
at Open DNS in San Francisco before that

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,660
I was a sysadmin for 12 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,129
my free time i enjoy rock climbing

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:00,209
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> video games and surfing in the</font>

19
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">ocean not online but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that too so</font>

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,150
the agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> for today we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,939
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a history of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> botnets just uh</font>

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,030
overview the birth of botnets move on to

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,169
the life cycle of a bot highlight some

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,830
botnet network architectures then move

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,600
on to what a bot can do botnet functions

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:25,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">its highlight some different malware</font>

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,759
that BOTS usually drop highlight some

28
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,720
famous botnets some detection methods so

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,020
ones that we use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> open dns and then a</font>

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,610
manual analysis of a botnet domains from

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,210
DNS traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to begin with what</font>

32
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,039
is a bot what's a botnet it's a network

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,949
of computers infected with malware

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,909
they're controlled as a group a bot will

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,470
perform automated commands and they're

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,530
controlled by a community control

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,000
servers controlled by a blunt master and

38
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,360
then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk we're going to focus</font>

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,669
on domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are associated with</font>

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,240
planets so to begin with bots we're not

41
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:16,170
always malicious started out

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,510
in IRC channels here's an example of a

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,239
non malicious but that would you could

44
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,880
just play a nice little trivia game with

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:31,200
in an IRC<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel and it would even</font>

46
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:35,490
serve you a cold beer so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched</font>

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,480
first started to move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in IRC in 1999</font>

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:43,200
notable ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called a egg drop this</font>

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,019
one was designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> control user banned</font>

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,030
lists and help prevent channel floods

51
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,000
from happening and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had a</font>

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,180
feature that was called botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,910
would which linked the bots together

54
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,950
between the rooms and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we see</font>

55
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,960
that features evolved today with linking

56
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots together pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> park</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">download files and execute them</font>

58
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,790
different IRC channels and then one of

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most famous a GoBot which was one of</font>

60
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first customized BOTS to order so</font>

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,620
from the coder you could get a bot

62
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,180
designed with specific exploits that you

63
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,250
wanted when the most famous<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

64
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">elsass exploit and which actually got</font>

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,640
the attention of Microsoft and law

66
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,200
enforcement and to find the decoder so

67
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,500
they could shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> that down this is a</font>

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,679
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of the code that was</font>

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,410
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gavotte when it was first seen and</font>

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:49,610
the source code was actually released on

71
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:53,010
the internet which led to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bots</font>

72
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,300
barring that making them their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own so it</font>

73
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,299
started out with just spots

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,710
participating in a targeted IRC attack

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,209
so denial service attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in channel</font>

76
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:10,530
floods in 2003-2004 there was a boost in

77
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:12,060
malicious bots on on the net<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to move away from just</font>

79
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:21,358
communicating through IRC to http just

80
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:25,050
because with firewalls you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

81
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,609
block a ir c traffic but with HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

82
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,940
usually always allow through a firewall

83
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:37,139
so the life cycle of a bot it'll start

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,879
with the infections and then spreading

85
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:48,090
so infection that what they use for

86
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:51,270
infection use spam so though initiate a

87
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,580
spam campaign and send malicious

88
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,969
attachments to to lead to the download

89
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,810
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through injected code on</font>

90
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,099
a compromise website which would lead to

91
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:09,509
to an exploit kit and also through

92
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:12,628
vertising so with malicious ads and then

93
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:14,580
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a bot needs to make contact</font>

94
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:16,440
with the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control server so</font>

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,900
there's different rallying techniques

96
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,669
that they can use less common is a

97
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,060
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP list in a config file on the</font>

98
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:30,150
bot just because it's easy to figure

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:35,330
that out so they've moved away more from

100
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to using a domain flux so through a</font>

101
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">DGA a domain generation algorithm it</font>

102
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:46,349
will produce thousands of domains based

103
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:49,380
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those dj's and then only one of</font>

104
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:50,759
those thousands will be will be used

105
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,759
actually as the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

106
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,870
server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they'll use IP flux so</font>

107
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:01,259
they'll be constantly changing the IP

108
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,180
that the domain is resolving to and then

109
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,629
from here once it makes contact it's

110
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,650
ready to accept commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and report back</font>

111
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:14,879
so from here can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a</font>

112
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">ddos attempt it can be used to spread as</font>

113
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam bot to spread more spam so</font>

114
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,369
further the infection and make the

115
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,069
botnet grow larger or can just become a

116
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,979
nympho<font color="#E5E5E5"> stealer to steal from information</font>

117
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:33,089
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and then the goal is to</font>

118
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain that that bought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep keep it</font>

119
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,600
very vague detection

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,780
and they'll use the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> rallying</font>

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:44,550
techniques with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain flux and the IP</font>

122
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:47,210
flux some of the network architectures

123
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,550
that are used the first was a

124
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:54,510
centralized command and control topology

125
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:58,400
here so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> through IRC HTTP there's</font>

126
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one command and control server</font>

127
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,159
controlled by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot master and so just</font>

128
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one server would send out commands</font>

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:14,640
and store the stolen info there next is

130
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,820
a peer-to-peer infrastructure so the

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,310
infected BOTS can share and sending the

132
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,080
commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the data to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

133
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,630
community control server and then it's

134
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:29,700
using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> file sharing protocols TCP UDP</font>

135
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,880
ICMP and then there's the hybrid one

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,400
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most resilient and the most</font>

137
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,070
popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> one nowadays such as combines</font>

138
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,989
centralized with peer-to-peer but and

139
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,120
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be multiple command control</font>

140
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,240
servers and then one control panel

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,610
that's controlled through because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,650
multiple community control servers can

143
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:56,790
act as they act as proxy so it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

144
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:00,659
harder to detect so botnet functions

145
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,470
what can I bought do so I've said before

146
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:07,590
you can it connect as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spambot to</font>

147
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:11,040
further infect more computers it can be

148
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,900
a act as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> forum grabber on a computer</font>

149
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,680
so in the config there would be a

150
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard-coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs that it's going to to</font>

151
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,540
search for a traffic going there and

152
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it will grab what's entered into</font>

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,340
forms on on those sites take screenshots

154
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,560
of a machine just to grab personal data

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,990
redirect HTTP traffic you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to a legitimate site and you get</font>

157
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,589
redirected to a fake phishing site where

158
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:44,579
it can steal your credentials keyloggers

159
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:45,640
to steal passwords they have VNC modules

160
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,580
where

161
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,439
attacker can remotely control your pc as

162
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,900
if they're physically there and then

163
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,500
stealing cookies so participating in

164
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,760
session hijacking to gain access as

165
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:05,140
authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> user to a site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font>

an infection on<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine they can also</font>

168
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:15,160
drop different types of malware so for

169
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,250
again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grogger form grabber this</font>

170
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:23,709
is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an old older version of</font>

171
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:28,330
droid x with pre-configured<font color="#CCCCCC"> urls that's</font>

172
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:31,900
it's going to spy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we used as a trojan</font>

173
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:35,800
backdoor to intercept any network

174
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:39,459
traffic the most famous right now is the

175
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:43,359
with crypto ransomware which encrypts a

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,380
droid x just spies on banking sessions a

179
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,170
quick fraud bot so like the bead app

180
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan just to generate revenue by</font>

181
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:08,319
clicking on ads and then of course as a

182
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:10,330
dee da spot so one technique that the

183
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,770
malware where we use once it's on a

184
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:17,250
system is a code injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> this screen</font>

185
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,410
capture here is the angler exploit kit

186
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,440
using code injection on a compromise

187
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,770
website and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that angler</font>

188
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,850
exploit kit as part of the knee curse

189
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:33,550
botnet so here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screenshot</font>

190
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">captured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show mean I a dll file that</font>

191
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,609
gets injected into the browser process

192
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,790
and the OS sees it as as a safe process

193
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,920
so it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to run and then at that</font>

194
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,910
point the exploit kit can take advantage

195
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin exploits that the machine</font>

197
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,089
java once once to execute that code then

198
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,009
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> download</font>

199
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:05,139
knickers bought on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and it</font>

200
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:09,309
will be enlisted into the botnet I'm

201
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">famous spots dried X it uses the hybrid</font>

202
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:17,469
peer-to-peer network architecture first

203
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,470
spotted in 2014 mostly stealing

204
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,329
credentials to targeted banking sites

205
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,249
today it's mostly spread through spam

206
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:31,899
and embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> Word documents with</font>

207

malicious macros embedded originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

208
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:39,160
had a centralized network architecture

209
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:43,359
switched to the more resilient a hybrid

210
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:47,170
peer-to-peer a lot of numbers out there

211
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,779
for the estimated amount stolen but 30

212
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,269
million is one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was the</font>

213
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,730
target of an attempted<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takedown</font>

214
00:11:52,269 --> 00:12:00,959
operation in 2015 which wasn't very

215
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:04,779
successful so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

216
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:11,199
different layers that are seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

217
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:14,230
hybrid peer-to-peer layout here the

218
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:16,809
first layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is comprised of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infected</font>

219
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,689
users computers so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where tho</font>

220
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:24,360
except and carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the commands the</font>

221
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:28,480
second layer will call nodes that is

222
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,449
more infected users but these users can

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,660
act as<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP proxies and that's bitch</font>

224
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:37,269
between the the bots and then the

225
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">front-end community control servers</font>

226
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,629
which are next and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> proxy layer</font>

227
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:46,410
is made up of compromise servers and

228
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,850
that's going to act as another proxy

229
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,879
between the back end where the control

230
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:57,220
panel is where all the stolen data will

231
00:12:51,879 --> 00:13:01,149
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> held so I have a visualization a</font>

232
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:07,050
movie here using open graffiti it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

233
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:08,820
open source tool my coworker tebow

234
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,109
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pronounce his last names I</font>

235
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,010
won't try this tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tebow made this tool</font>

236
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,800
it's a 3d data visualization so will

237
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:25,130
visualize graph data sets so what you

238
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,899
can do is take a JSON file that has the

239
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships of the eyepiece hashes</font>

240
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:36,709
URLs domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen and put it into open</font>

241
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,149
graffiti and then we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

242
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:46,170
visualization here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showing</font>

243
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:48,269
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationships what the</font>

244
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">information I gave it here was see two</font>

245
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:56,149
servers at a time between<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty fifteen</font>

246
00:13:51,839 --> 00:14:01,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and twenty sixteen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the dried exponent</font>

247
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:03,570
so the blue the blue nodes are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

248
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,380
addresses of the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

249
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,769
server scene and then showing how

250
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,709
they're related to urls that we're

251
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing and that in the orange color and</font>

252
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:20,969
then on the purple color<font color="#E5E5E5"> its hashes so a</font>

253
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:26,120
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these mostly just the dried x</font>

254
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan and what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it helps us</font>

255
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,700
see the patterns in in there under

256
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,070
infrastructure and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how some</font>

257
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP addresses are related to each</font>

258
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">other through through the hashes seen</font>

259
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:44,339
and others are just out there on their

260
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:49,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">own and other the ones related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

261
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,279
some pretty large clusters

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:09,260
okay another famous botnet knickers it's

263
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:15,590
also a hybrid of peer-to-peer botnets so

264
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:19,010
they use they also will use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dj's that</font>

265
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,560
they can push update through the

266
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:25,340
peer-to-peer network so they can have

267
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJ's sign different CNC servers out</font>

268
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the botnet and though they'll</font>

269
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,619
generate a lot of these just just create

270
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:38,180
noise so there'll be thousands of

271
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,080
domains out there and they'll only

272
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:45,109
register actually one of the domains the

273
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,110
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> women would just be NX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

274
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,540
knickers has been seen spreading<font color="#CCCCCC"> locky</font>

275
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,420
and dried<font color="#CCCCCC"> x or spam it's also been</font>

276
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:58,569
related to the angler exploit kit and

277
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:01,099
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently it's been seen as part of</font>

278
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,340
hosting the alert community control

279
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,140
servers this is a new banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans</font>

280
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,320
estimated to have stolen 45 million

281
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,870
dollars already so here's another

282
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,280
visualization using open graffiti of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

283
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,480
knickers botnet so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

284
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:22,850
command-and-control servers that we saw

285
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:26,060
and how they're related to the hashes

286
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,150
the hashes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got from a virus total and</font>

287
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:32,359
these particular ones here are showing

288
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:36,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they were seen associated with lurk</font>

289
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,490
server and beat up

290
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,450
so both of these botnets have been the

291
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,130
focus of some takedown attempts knickers

292
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:52,110
had a bunch of their community<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

293
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:54,450
servers sinkhole on june first they

294
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:59,250
actually went completely silent for

295
00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:00,750
about 24 hours and during<font color="#E5E5E5"> that period 1</font>

296
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,780
million host we're seeing trying to

297
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:08,069
attempt<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect to the to the command</font>

298
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:10,859
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control servers they've resumed full</font>

299
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:14,569
activity already by the end of june and

300
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:18,359
are taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> part in more spam campaigns</font>

301
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:22,589
with dried x so there take down the temp

302
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:25,250
apt it happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> october 2015 really</font>

303
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:32,000
big refusing an activity a week later

304
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:32,000
just due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its hybrid a network there</font>

305
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:39,720
so it's still spreading the tried extra

306
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan and it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

307
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">something new lately where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

308
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,919
participating in spreading<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the walkie</font>

309
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,919
ransomware through through spam and it's

310
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:55,160
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a javascript exploits in</font>

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:59,660
the email so some detection methods

312
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,630
these are through analyzing DNS traffic

313
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,810
so at a token<font color="#CCCCCC"> dienes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 plus</font>

314
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,440
billion<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS requests a day from the</font>

315
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are using our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS resolvers so</font>

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,870
then since we get all those requests

317
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,540
were able to see the traffic patterns of

318
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:23,129
queries going to the domains and then we

319
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,200
have the history of a domain so we'll be

320
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to see the history of the ip's the</font>

321
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,780
domains been associated to the name

322
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:35,180
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs we have a we have a tool</font>

323
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use and it's called investigate</font>

324
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,930
so we'll use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in when we're</font>

325
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,870
investigating domains to see the DNS

326
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,130
requests and then pivot off of the

327
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,179
different data that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

328
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,180
screen capture of it

329
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,889
so one way one detection method is

330
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,000
through detecting domain generation

331
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:59,800
algorithms so again that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it will</font>

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,140
use random characters and combine it

333
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,200
with some type of dynamic component to

334
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,840
generate just random domain names it

335
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,790
might be a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> combined with their</font>

336
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:16,750
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and just symbols it makes a</font>

337
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:21,940
new domain each iteration and then the

338
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:23,380
purpose is so that the the bot has a way

339
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,260
to contact the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control</font>

340
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,120
server so very few of the domains are

341
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,640
actually registered out of the thousands

342
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,629
that it will generate just create noise

343
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,060
makes it hard for the analyst to to know

344
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,880
which one's actually being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used but it's</font>

345
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:45,970
easy to detect a DJ domain name just by

346
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:51,220
using lexical filters here's an example

347
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:53,530
of some angler exploit kit<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJs so here I</font>

348
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,530
guess so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing there there's a</font>

349
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:59,590
letter a number and then an animal name

350
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:06,010
and these and they're all registered at

351
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:09,310
on the dot top TLD these are example of

352
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:12,460
the timba banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DJs so it</font>

353
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:18,429
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to reverse engineer the</font>

354
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:19,630
algorithm to find out what the with what

355
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,930
the next I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is going to be that's</font>

356
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:27,550
registered and then you can we can pre

357
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:33,000
block all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the all the domains and then</font>

358
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:33,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beat up djs</font>

359
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:39,929
so in other ways by detecting traffic

360
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,759
spikes in the DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests that we get</font>

361
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:46,479
so if there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden surge of queries</font>

362
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:50,590
from the clients will see that sudden

363
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:52,719
surge in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a query</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> request but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

364
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,759
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden surge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in traffic it</font>

365
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:57,729
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

366
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:01,029
malicious is happening it will also run

367
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:03,820
that through other filters so looking at

368
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:05,859
the domain history of it so the IP

369
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:11,710
history like if there's been abrupt

370
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:15,789
changes the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> has changed ip's just</font>

371
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,469
numerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> times the query volumes that</font>

372
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,830
are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming in and then the</font>

373
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:25,779
geolocation like the distribution of the

374
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:27,580
queries and then if this spike has

375
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:29,710
happened before like is it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal</font>

376
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,899
thing for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain to suddenly have a</font>

377
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,580
spike<font color="#CCCCCC"> in traffic or not so this will</font>

378
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:37,839
lead us to domains that are associated

379
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:41,408
with exploit kits fishing campaigns and

380
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:45,369
then help helps us find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DJ's that</font>

381
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:49,479
are associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the botnet so once</font>

382
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:51,820
these automated tasks run then the

383
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:54,009
analysts we can do a manual analysis on

384
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,529
the domains and then we can find

385
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,869
additional bad domains off of the IPS

386
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:01,450
associated or the name servers or the

387
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:04,389
hashes that the malicious hashes as seen

388
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,889
making a call out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those domains and</font>

389
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,738
then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

390
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:12,699
categorization by using all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

391
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:16,299
different indicators this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

392
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">from investigate of just showing just a</font>

393
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:21,279
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> spike in traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where as there</font>

394
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:23,968
was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden spike in</font>

395
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries</font>

396
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:33,600
so manual analysis so here is a this

397
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,480
domain spotted on July eighteenth so all

398
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,600
this data here is what we've seen on

399
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,050
July eighteenth I think it's since been

400
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">sink cold after that date so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

401
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:51,060
sudden spike in traffic here and it also

402
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:55,199
hit the DGA filter just because the

403
00:22:51,060 --> 00:23:00,050
lexical filter on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the domain there and</font>

404
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,970
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> an investigate I can also see that</font>

405
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:06,720
that this domain has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated to</font>

406
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,240
these malicious hashes through a threat

407
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,460
grid integration and then these hashes

408
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,910
are are seen to be locking ransomware

409
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:22,470
and then I can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> then further and see</font>

410
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,710
the different domains that domain

411
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,060
call-outs that the hatch actually made

412
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,570
different network connections that

413
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:33,750
attempted to make so here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

414
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:38,490
of some more network connections that

415
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:42,350
the walkie sample was seen making some

416
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:46,050
dns<font color="#CCCCCC"> call outs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to and you can see they</font>

417
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:54,600
they also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

418
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:58,950
dgs this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a example of currying</font>

419
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:03,120
the investigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so it's a it's</font>

420
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:05,190
querying just a given domain and getting

421
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">back the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hashes that have been seen</font>

422
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,110
associated to that domain and then

423
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,000
showing all the associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

424
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,419
call-outs that get made off of that

425
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,360
malicious hash

426
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:25,260
and also work more djs seen there

427
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,990
another way is we can pivot off of the

428
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,200
domain email registrants so we have a

429
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:33,150
registrant here that scene just

430
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,420
registering a lot of domains that are

431
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:39,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">DJs all from the same email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and</font>

432
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">there also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll show me that they're</font>

433
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:47,189
associated to other other malware

434
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,020
attacks and then if I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

435
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,510
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those different dj's that the</font>

436
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,910
registrant has registered I can see some

437
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,580
odd traffic spikes on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> DJ domains</font>

438
00:24:53,910 --> 00:25:01,190
so if they have a similar pattern of

439
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:04,800
spikes I can see if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> related</font>

440
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,080
another way is by the co-occurrences off

441
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,770
of those domains that are all under the

442
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,870
same registrant so co-occurrence is when

443
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,580
a domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> request two or more domains</font>

444
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:19,080
within a very short period of time like

445
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:23,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">seconds so here's this DJ domain that's</font>

446
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,500
registered through this email<font color="#CCCCCC"> address it</font>

447
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:31,140
also has co-occurrences that are more

448
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,600
djs and then using some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more</font>

449
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,060
sources I can you know look on

450
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,949
virustotal get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> P caps of network</font>

451
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,340
traffic that's showing more malicious

452
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,300
activity that's seen off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

453
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:49,800
domains so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what the</font>

454
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:55,770
attack is and then lastly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

455
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:58,440
connecting the the registrants through

456
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:02,490
to the different attacks helps so the

457
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">email registrants associated to their</font>

458
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,260
attacks through them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware so the</font>

459
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,140
malware will make a call out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

460
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:14,540
domains that the are associated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

461
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:17,430
email registrant and then we're able to

462
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:21,870
connect them to other registrants

463
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:25,440
through their domains as well so it

464
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be dropped from one domain so its</font>

465
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,130
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way and</font>

466
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:33,790
it makes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> call-outs to another</font>

467
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,930
domain that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DGA registered as part</font>

468
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:41,740
of a botnet so here we've got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

469
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:45,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">knickers botnet connected through a</font>

470
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:51,370
registrant that's also spreading angler

471
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:54,060
on their domains and that's it so

472
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,060
anybody have any questions

473
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,330
so you mentioned that these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

474
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,300
write these things will register a bunch

475
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:24,149
of domains for i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> like obfuscation</font>

476
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,010
are they actually what are they doing

477
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:30,660
with these domains that that actually

478
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in the way of malware analyzers so</font>

479
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,440
most of them won't actually be

480
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:40,050
registered it'll be generated and like

481
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,230
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bots will try to make a call out</font>

482
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:47,700
to it but it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NX don't domain</font>

483
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:50,370
it doesn't exist anywhere so you'll see

484
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,200
it in the DNS traffic that it's trying

485
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,270
to connect to it but it's not actually

486
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,030
registered it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

487
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,030
thousands or tens of thousands

488
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:16,720
so I'm more secure if I use opendns than

489
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:16,720
Google DNS block<font color="#CCCCCC"> tGI's yes good point</font>

490
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,230
hey thanks guys
