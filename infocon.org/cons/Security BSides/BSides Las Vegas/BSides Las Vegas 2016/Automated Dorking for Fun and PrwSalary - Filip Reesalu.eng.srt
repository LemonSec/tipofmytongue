<font color="#CCCCCC">alright I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,800
about a side project I've been working

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,620
on developing around Dorking mostly you

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,480
probably know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is I'll I'll do a</font>

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,529
quick introduction I probably won't use

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,500
my entire 30 or 40 minutes that I have

7
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:25,259
to be for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink beer my name is</font>

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,189
Philip Breslow i'm currently a security

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,170
researcher at recorder future<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used to</font>

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:34,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a software engineer in linguistics</font>

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:40,290
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a much-hyped data</font>

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:43,589
scientist role for a while so start off

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,410
by introducing what dorkiness looking at

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,379
a few tools that exist today and the

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,050
issues that I see with those then I'll

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door key which is the thing i built</font>

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,000
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll discuss some of the future</font>

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,940
sort of projects or ways this could

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,160
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thai food try and cool the</font>

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">dorking or search engine hacking is</font>

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,929
nothing new it's been around for ages it

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,200
sort of took off in 2002 when Johnny

23
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,939
long started collecting a little

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,590
database of the works as they're called

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,750
these clever search terms and we can see

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,350
why it's called why it's called a dork

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,990
from the original page Google dork an

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,990
inept or foolish person has<font color="#E5E5E5"> real by</font>

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,960
Google and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looked like</font>

30
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,750
way back when this has sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of morphed</font>

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,389
into this shiny looking thing exploit DB

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,439
I was the google<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking database and</font>

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,750
it's it gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> new search terms every few</font>

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,729
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically and it's related to</font>

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,040
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when a new vulnerability</font>

36
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,509
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> up people want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find servers</font>

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:56,070
that are vulnerable this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

38
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,079
of work so searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ham dita XL</font>

39
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">back door in the title of the page</font>

40
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,070
brings up web shells of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific kind</font>

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,818
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we click through to these we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

42
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:12,180
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that server so since this has</font>

43
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,049
been going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> since 2002 why why bother</font>

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,730
doing the

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,130
I think there's a talk on this every few

46
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,989
years it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> as relevant if not more</font>

47
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,730
relevant we got the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

48
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,320
you know toaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> d dos webcams someone</font>

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,769
can sneak in and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your parents</font>

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">what can I make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it everything is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

51
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,010
you get ICS SCADA systems online<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,660
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example this you and then again</font>

53
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,260
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> has really changed it's still</font>

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are publicly</font>

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,890
posting sites without having login

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,630
credentials or the use the default week

57
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,329
credentials so it's still it still

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,359
matters so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at trying to</font>

59
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good example of this old Dorking</font>

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,200
thing a google<font color="#CCCCCC"> search technique aided</font>

61
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">new york</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> damn hacker in iran you could</font>

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,190
think oh that's that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool or</font>

63
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,989
pretty bad but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again when we look</font>

64
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,390
at when this was published<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a few</font>

65
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago so that's that's a bit of a</font>

66
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:17,730
fail so when most people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> dorking</font>

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,459
they think google searching or like

68
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,810
normal text search<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just wanted to</font>

69
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,510
bring this up just to highlight some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

70
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issues with these things google has</font>

71
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,190
great advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> search operators most</font>

72
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,350
dorks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find especially on the</font>

73
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,890
google hacking database as implied by

74
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,420
the name is our game for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Bing</font>

75
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,579
filters a bunch of dorky results you

76
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,329
can't find SQL files like searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,600
the file type extension and as limited

78
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:48,989
advanced operators on the flip side Bing

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,700
has an api google has removed their

80
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,860
search api they only provide one that's

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,690
called custom search engine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

82
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,250
sort of trick that into searching the

83
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,290
whole web that you get very limited

84
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:03,209
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

85
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what search engines i support here</font>

86
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:10,010
later some of the existing tools they

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,090
all seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be focused on single-use</font>

88
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:17,070
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pretty you ice and most</font>

89
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,690
projects are dead hopefully this won't

90
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those projects you know</font>

91
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,000
hopefully not and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted for this</font>

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,340
is something i did at work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">later publish open source and free for</font>

94
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,330
everyone this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted</font>

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,280
machine-readable results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

96
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,490
set up alerts on for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,929
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerted whenever a certain domain is</font>

99
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that something is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on for</font>

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,960
example for a specific company notable

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">here search diggity they have a very</font>

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice website with a lot of good</font>

103
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">information but the last updates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:57,670
see where from 2013 so I built this

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,729
little thing called dorky this it's hard

106
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:04,570
to read here but it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

107
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:09,670
management interface for keeping track

108
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:11,580
of which dorks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to run let's</font>

109
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,650
split<font color="#CCCCCC"> up into two different components</font>

110
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,359
we have a runner that collects these

111
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,580
dorks from a mongrel database and runs

112
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,900
them and close the results waits a

113
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,750
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it does it all over</font>

114
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,049
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UIL component</font>

115
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed a picture of just now and</font>

116
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,040
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between those two is the mongrel</font>

117
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,020
database that just stores the

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,020
information the dorks the results I

119
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,240
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> this using Python I like Python I</font>

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,040
do it a lot for work I used Mongo

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,320
because it's it's free<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's he set up</font>

122
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,669
and if you want to do some rapid

123
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,530
development you don't have to specify a

124
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,990
schema or anything you just shove it in

125
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,719
there and Burkes org which is a great

126
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,810
little web application thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,910
it's what powers flask if you haven't

128
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,910
used it you should really try it

129
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,760
included search engines I i included

130
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">google unfortunately since they don't</font>

131
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an API you will need a thousand</font>

132
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,090
proxies but it works Bing using their

133
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,410
API Google custom search if you have

134
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">something specific you want to do as</font>

135
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,330
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> shodhan and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">rodin it's it's basically like a</font>

137
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,740
searchable n map that runs across the

138

<font color="#E5E5E5">web and they collect screenshots and</font>

139
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,010
things from open and rdp port to think

140
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,770
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool you should check it out</font>

so the UI is very simple I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

143
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,940
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something very cool</font>

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,669
you put in put a query and put a

145
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,229
description you put it in a category you

146
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:48,609
give it a source<font color="#E5E5E5"> you found it somewhere</font>

147
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,490
and then you pick what search and you

148
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from and then it shows</font>

149
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,620
up here at this room a little bit hard

150
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,849
to see here and as soon as you add it

151
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,860
and you have this sort of runner

152
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:01,240
component going it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up that</font>

153
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">career next time it runs and it will</font>

154
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,310
execute it and collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results and</font>

155
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,840
looking at the results this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just in</font>

156
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,759
the UI you just get to see which which

157
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,859
IP in which pork and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the header</font>

158
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,229
that came back if you look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

159
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,949
database it's the whole cached response

160
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:24,340
from Sheldon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example for a</font>

161
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">google search it's the URL the sort of</font>

162
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,030
title of the page and then the little

163
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:37,690
description that comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your google</font>

164
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:41,710
search result so for configuration it

165
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,139
talks through a Mongo database that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

166
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,919
need to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you need you select which</font>

167
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:52,360
search engines<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are active you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

168
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:55,690
input your API keys for certain sites ok

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,270
Google you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Roxy set up and then</font>

170
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need some filtering because you</font>

171
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,900
don't get you need to filter out because

172
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,639
a lot of people repost these dorks on

173
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:10,719
for example blogspot or whatever and

174
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:12,880
then you'll get noise in your data as I

175
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:15,400
said some of the issues here our results

176
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,580
are not perfect sometimes there's a lot

177
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,400
of noise there's right limiting you have

178
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,198
to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pace yourself and if you use</font>

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,359
the api's then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> API costs</font>

180
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,449
involved because if you run all the

181
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919
dorks from the google hacking database

182
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,120
then you'll run out of money pretty

183
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,390
quickly if you're using baying for

184
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,909
example and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the biggest issues</font>

185
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,309
and the big reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a lot of</font>

186
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,260
these projects fail is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

187
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,578
when the api's are updated or when the

188
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">websites are changed you need to update</font>

189
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:48,469
your approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I could tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when</font>

190
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,180
we'll turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> their search api you</font>

191
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,220
could tell a ton of project just

192
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,219
collapsed and then never<font color="#CCCCCC"> updated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

193
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:05,660
so some some of the future things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

194
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:09,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to add more search engines github</font>

195
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,230
virustotal hybrid analysis or some ideas

196
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,630
some better logging and error handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

197
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,300
have been a bit lazy but i'm working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

198
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,070
improving it then adding a pipe to

199
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,310
elasticsearch<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool if</font>

200
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,350
someone wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up their own works</font>

201
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,079
the way i'm using this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm running this</font>

202
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,000
in our production system right now but

203
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,380
I'm piping the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> into or or sort</font>

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,240
of platform and in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

205
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,600
alerting capabilities and stuff like

206
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:41,089
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not add the output to</font>

207
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,040
elasticsearch myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured I'll show</font>

208
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:45,800
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a live demo I'm not</font>

209
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,449
on the on the Wi-Fi so i won't give you

210
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,899
the actual running the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dorking but i'll</font>

211
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:52,160
show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UI looks if you want to</font>

212
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,380
if you want to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I</font>

219
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,270

have it's not on get up yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

221
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,199
script that imports the entire google

hacking database into your own local

223
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,620
database so its grapes that website it

224
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,880
puts them in as not enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> to begin</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to lose all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we wanted to enable this guy hit it it's</font>

228
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,470
enabled and it will start running next

229
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">time it's run the query</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed from</font>

230
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:05,420
showdown is in here you run some query

231
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,990
sq webcam it gives you a bunch of webcam

232
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:11,630
results and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sort of</font>

233
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">ugly results in here but it's a ton of</font>

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,830
webcams available

235
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,950
and I didn't intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this to be a long</font>

236
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,690
talk I wanted to keep it very brief

237
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,779
because if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try this</font>

238
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,910
out please go on github start running<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

239
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,760
there's no reason for me to stand here

240
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and drone on for 30 minutes about</font>

241
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,490
something quite simple that was it if

242
00:11:45,020 --> 00:12:02,720
anyone has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions or comments</font>

243
00:11:46,490 --> 00:12:06,410
please yes I they are I mean that's for

244
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me it's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working out so far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

245
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,020
I have maybe maybe a gigabyte or

246
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:22,760
something in the in the production one

247
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:24,500
and it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine yes you mentioned</font>

248
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
machine readability towards the

249
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning but it's not a command line</font>

250
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,990
tool is the idea that you have that

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,820
people would know sir yeah so what would

252
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,500
I use this for is that I have a separate

253
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,230
script that I run the pulse data from

254
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,029
this manga database as soon as new and

255
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I sort of pushed that into wherever</font>

256
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,480
I want it

257
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,060
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm currently pushing it into so what</font>

258
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,890
I'm pushing it into a recorded future

259
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,930
which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys won't have the option to</font>

260
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,420
do unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start working at recorded</font>

261
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,680
future you can talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me afterwards if</font>

262
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to work at record a future</font>

263
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:12,770
anybody else well if not then thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
