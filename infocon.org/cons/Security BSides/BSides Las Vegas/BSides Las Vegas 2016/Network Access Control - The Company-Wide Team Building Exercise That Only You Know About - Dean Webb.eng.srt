00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
so our first talk today is on network

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,270
access control the company-wide

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,210
team-building exercise that only you

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about by Dean web from networking</font>

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">forums let's give dean a round of</font>

applause thank you thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,160
here this is my first time to present at

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,930
a technical conference I've done

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,279
stand-up before and I have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,650
is a lot easier than stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,679
it's serious so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't laugh I'm</font>

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,449
good all right and I gotta laugh so

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,589
there I'm even better all right now

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,559
we're access control i gave it this

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,570
title because when i started at my

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,030
current role here I was the new guy and

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,920
I was young I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was brash I was eager and</font>

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,510
they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey you could do the network</font>

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,100
access control project I thought yeah I

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,199
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show him what I can do and I</font>

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,710
didn't realize it was the crap project

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,430
that nobody else wanted and then I found

23
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:01,190
out why soon I became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neck engineer</font>

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,319
that's right I am the one who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knacks and</font>

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,309
I it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> my job to tell people you're</font>

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,779
not going to be able to connect this to

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,399
the network anymore or you have to have

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,590
a certificate or we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have another</font>

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,619
log in and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guy i was</font>

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,430
showing up and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being mean to</font>

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,290
everybody and I was alone i was telling

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,680
people what i wanted from them what I

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:27,299
wanted to do to them what I against them

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,860
it was a whole relationship and the as I

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neck engineers I realize</font>

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,289
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the neck project can sometimes go</font>

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,640
off the rails and do things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that you didn't want to have</font>

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,930
happen and this is largely again due to

40
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the lack of communication between</font>

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,619
different branches of the business and

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual network access control</font>

43
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,229
project i I've talked to people where

44
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,850
yes it was Skynet<font color="#E5E5E5"> unleashed or brought</font>

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,979
down an entire production line it

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,860
brought down the worldwide ATM network

47
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,210
it did horrible horrible things and I

48
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,310
will not say where those happened

49
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,889
because charter house rules there are

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,450
Chapman house rules sorry but yeah they

51
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,030
happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it was bad and it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,360
bloody but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be that</font>

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,400
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font>

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,950
if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I</font>

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,530
need to bring in

56
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,869
people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> other organizations to</font>

57
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,370
assist<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in this project and yeah I</font>

58
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,170
show the care bears here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

59
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,450
because they care if I bring them in

60
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,738
they'll care about what I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,130
the team<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and you think about this</font>

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,989
knack involves much more than the

65
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,140
network it involves everything that

66
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,090
connects<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the network all your windows</font>

here the executive the director type who

91
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,150
at the very least can talk to other

departments and let them know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you're</font>

96
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,290
when the executives talk to executives

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,769
when managers talk to managers they're

98
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:52,730
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help smooth the wheels that are</font>

99
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,870
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grind slowly forward if I am</font>

100
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:59,780
just sending emails to some guy over in

101
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,790
client say hey we're about to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

102
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,470
whole new package<font color="#E5E5E5"> of client software and</font>

103
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,230
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to have admin level</font>

104
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,819
access to all the windows devices I send

105
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,540
that to him directly he's taking that

106
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:13,849
cold and I get immediate resistance if

107
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,620
my manager talks to his manager it's a

108
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,810
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier if my executive talks to</font>

109
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,789
his executive it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

110
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,159
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the organization becomes</font>

111
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:25,580
bought into the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network</font>

112
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:26,460
access control succeeding and if I have

113
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,849
a client

114
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,888
person actually on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> team or having our</font>

windows boxes instead of absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

122
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,830
it's I might be difficult but that's

123
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,318
good I can work with that might be

124
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,729
difficult that's a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

125
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> productive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of conversation</font>

127
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,330
although those<font color="#E5E5E5"> also start interesting</font>

128
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,910
conversations but yes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a team</font>

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,359
engineer you have the final say on the

182
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,279
answers these are part of your team they

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,409
will advise you you take that advice in

184
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,969
and then you communicate in now I've

185
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,879
mentioned vendors which vendor is the

186
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,469
best usually it's the second one I've

187
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,650
talked to a lot of guys who done neck

188
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:18,839
around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and repeatedly I here</font>

189
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,299
oh yeah we ripped out vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> X it was a</font>

190
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,749
piece of junk but in vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> y work great</font>

191
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,699
and then somewhere else Oh vendor why

192
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:28,529
please we tore him out we put in vendor

193
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">X as we're a very happy with indirect</font>

194
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:34,259
and I realized it doesn't matter who the

195
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,669
vendor is all the time there are some

196
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,330
places where ya a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor is going to be</font>

197
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">better for this than that but in general</font>

198
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,359
it wasn't the vendor that made the

199
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,039
difference it was the experience it was

200
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,289
the lessons learned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font>

201
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,089
to do it right and the first time they

202
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">did it they made a whole lot of mistakes</font>

203
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,319
learn tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things from it they became</font>

204
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,270
very experienced and what that

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,860
experience came wisdom and I mean lack

206
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,159
of funding can be another problem there

207
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,319
they went to enforcement mode too soon

208
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,409
lots of things happen there and it all

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,110
comes down to lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> teamwork and I as</font>

210
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">I watch this I thought you know what</font>

211
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,979
there's no reason that my current vendor

212
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:17,430
has to be ripped out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go with</font>

213
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,020
vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I can make this one work if I</font>

214
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,279
bring the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people together if I have the</font>

215
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,008
right information if I can get the right

216
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,990
funding get all these pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> together my</font>

217
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,159
first vendor can be the right one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

218
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,060
there are places where this has happened

219
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:32,370
through some foresight or luck they<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

220
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,990
a team together and having that team

221
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,000
approach gave them a better shot at

222
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,690
security a better shot at getting this

223

and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information it can inform</font>

254
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,510
you about possible pitfalls with the

255
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,520
product that you either need to plan

256
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,350
carefully about or that maybe make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

257
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,360
something works out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the running but</font>

258
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,120
you talk to these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

not have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of product reviews for it</font>

261
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,970
because you know it's a very niche

262
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
product it's something that doesn't

263
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,780
happen all the time to everyone

264
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,699

305
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,400
about how a device actually

331
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,420
that network access control vendors have

332
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,390
realized is that the next system itself

333
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:03,740
can be this hub that orchestrates all

334
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,630
the other IT components that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

335
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,150
you you may have vulnerability scanning

336
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,800
it ties in with the client so the client

337
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">can help provide reports up to the</font>

338
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,560
bowler vulnerability scanner you've got

339
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,670
fire I that is one example well that's

340
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to tie in with some of these</font>

341
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,529
vendors here and then the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

342
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:23,629
report back up the stream you've got it

343
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:27,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus solution the nap will tie into</font>

344
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:29,779
that so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

345
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,699
very useful very helpful how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

package management on Windows SCCM it

351
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,990
can tie into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neck solutions that way</font>

352
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,149
when they get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network it forces</font>

353
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,279
them to have that package if you can

354
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,199
tell the SCCM guy you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

they can run with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they can see</font>

367
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,220
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they want to have</font>

368
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,749
and they'll start asking other people

369
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,120
when are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get neck turned on</font>

you do the project you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quick</font>

374
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:35,629
wins all right the I've talked to

375
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,339
consultants who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this</font>

00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,540
successfully to other firms and they say

379
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,019
into it turn that on get it going issue

380
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,430
all the certs from it could be a window

381
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,730
certificate authority that does it or

382
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,399
some other homegrown one it doesn't have

383
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a fancy entrust or verisign just</font>

384
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,740
get the cert on every box they check it

385
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,449
boom that is secure lock it down VPN

386
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,639
users they come in through a little

387
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,859
choke point and then explore the rest of

388
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,120
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cut neck there so it</font>

389
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,589
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say everybody who's connected with a</font>

390
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,240
VPN boom now they're they're properly

391
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:17,240
vetted they are the ones who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

392
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,759
on the network we're good there then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

393
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,889
next success that building or floor that

394
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,620
has all the IT guys in it not<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

395
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,509
they want to experience the potential

396
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">health at an act project is but because</font>

397
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,759
they'll give you rich error reporting

398
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,349
you know what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about they're</font>

Oh or it's broken they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

401
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:42,740
hey why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that I can't ssh over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

402
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 dot one dot 395</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you all</font>

403
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,190
right that's good and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can work</font>

404
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,520
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enzo oh here's why because we block</font>

405
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,680
this or that and you can go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

406
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,510
but those are your early successes those

407
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,339
are where you can say we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

408
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,230
things we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the value for the</font>

409
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,150
company now we can build on this and go

410
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward from there and the last one</font>

411
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:09,050
monitor everything before in forcing

412
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:11,720
anything so important because neck turns

413
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,819
into story time you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

414
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing on and people will insist I</font>

415
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:22,190
have zero devices of that particular

416
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:26,240
kind on this network turn on neck and it

417
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,280
finds two of them oh wait yeah that's

418
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,040
right we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to now that you mention</font>

419
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,930
it what are the oh yeah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

420
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,579
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we couldn't upgrade payroll</font>

421
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,859
and so we had to leave these devices on

422
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,280
and now that's how we get paid it's

423
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,570
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some mission-critical</font>

424
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,819
legacy application that you find and

434
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,889
deep trouble but you do the monitoring

435
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,480
you find this and you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is</font>

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,120
an unknown device tell me some more

437
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,030
about it or why is it that all of our

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,160
know that there's some other Nick

446
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,390
vendors to look at besides vendor so get

those wins in first<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you hit the</font>

resources diverted to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems</font>

450

that aren't next trouble but because

knack is new and involves math

456
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,809
stop complaining about the firewall and

457
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,480
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's next problem for the same fuzzy</font>

458
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:04,519
little errors out there they'll say can

you turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your job is to insist</font>

we figure out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

462
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,860
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is causing your errors</font>

463
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,210
and again back to monitoring if you're

monitoring you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone</font>

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,019
and say if we turned it on today<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

466

device would be blocked could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

467
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,249
me figure out and then once you

468
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">ascertain that ok now we've done these</font>

469
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:26,059
things it should not be blocked you turn

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's not blocked he knows you're</font>

473
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:37,669
there will be shocks a plenty here and

474
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,979
this is goes over a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

475
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,379
you'll see the number to their client is

in a build<font color="#E5E5E5"> state you can't do 802 dot1x</font>

480
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't be done and so you know the guy</font>

481
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,220
will say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got these build devices</font>

482
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,590
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do well it's either come up</font>

483
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,879
with some very elaborate rules or

484
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,080
sequester them to a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> area you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I learned from other</font>

490
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:18,200
say you're welcome because you're secure

upper security it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an act</font>

493
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,748
problem it's a company-wide perception

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,428
problem about what security<font color="#E5E5E5"> should or</font>

495
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:27,549
should not do and you have to get the

496
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:31,129
idea that if the seastar something is

497
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:33,668
getting act or getting blocked or

498
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:36,949
getting hit with a proxy error message

499
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:39,019
that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a level of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security that</font>

501
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:45,019
follows these rules and everyone will be

502

more secure as a result there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

sensitive devices that nobody knew about

that get nacked they say oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">planning a with an element of panic</font>

these beautiful lines and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

go from Veracruz to trace the PO taste

this other route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey would be two</font>

hours longer this is the fastest route

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,050
this is what google maps told me would

532
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:56,300
work it does not it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took an</font>

extra hour over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> above the time the</font>

will say ah yes this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how it'll work</font>

537
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,630
all your radius traffic will have high

will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it back to the problem i</font>

540
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,600
mentioned earlier turns out it fragments

541
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,790
and the fragments are not marked as

542
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,939

<font color="#E5E5E5">your ditch between cornfields also they</font>

544
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,210
may say things like hey we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you</font>

545
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,310
have a virtual solution great<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do</font>

546
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,320
it all virtual and then you find out

547
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,940
places where the virtual environment

548
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,700
that you plan to install doesn't have

549
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,960
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs to handle your load and yeah</font>

550
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,450
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what you do</font>

551
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,490
there um except buy more stuff but you

552
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">know this will happen you've got to be</font>

flexibility not only for troubleshooting

555
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,389
other problems but we're also dealing

556
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,550
with unusual circumstances that arise

557
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,380
that don't go according to plan if you

558
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,930
build in that time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build in</font>

559
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,940
those resources as little extra fluff

for I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can do that they</font>

can build in some cushion do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> enak</font>

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,880
should never be<font color="#CCCCCC"> runt on a tight string</font>

565
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,889
and a tight schedule<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to end capaz so many things</font>

567
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,490
it will touch the entire company it has

568
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,929
to be one of these more company

569
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,910
transformation sort of things so get the

570
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,130
team together early build out your

571
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,110
informal team the guys who aren't

572
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,810
attached to the project but know a lot

573
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,419
about it because you talk to them read

575
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,730
those early wins monitor everything

576
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:39,860
before enforcing anything and be ready

577
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,950
to troubleshoot just about anything at

578
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,330
any time and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance that</font>

579
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,280
you won't have to rip something out as

608
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,900
to what extent am I the only net guy

609
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:16,130
right now I've actually gotten at least

610
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,590
one other engineer trained on it what

<font color="#CCCCCC">more training out I will not stand alone</font>

615
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,240
because we are going to build this out

616
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,770
as a service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I have a background</font>

617
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,450
as a teacher so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able to go</font>

618
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,889
and get other groups in there but yeah

619
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,050
they finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> listened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me they got</font>

620
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">some more resources attached not just to</font>

621
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but also to the idea that</font>

622
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:44,720
this is a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah to what extent do</font>

623
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,490
you do the posture you know going over

624
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> above just your authorized on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

625
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,140
port or not like right dynamic ackles

626
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:55,520
and those types of things like what we

627
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:57,110
have is the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font>

628
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just to say can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get them on</font>

629
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,780
the network without killing everything

630
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,290
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even at the posturing part</font>

631
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,670
but we have tested things like that

632
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,920
where we said okay you know in this in

633
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,090
this IT area let's see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

634
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,120
we block everybody that doesn't have a

635
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,500
current virus signature and about twenty

636
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,120
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people got blocked and</font>

637
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,970
then they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and download it</font>

638
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:25,489
and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that works so we do</font>

639
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,560
a remediation VLAN and we can talk more

640
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:31,190
on that so we have time for one more

641
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:33,620
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you mentioned hundred</font>

642
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,670
forty windows endpoints how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

643
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,459
handling the non a tour to<font color="#E5E5E5"> annex</font>

644
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:42,350
supplicant and supported endpoints and

645
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,390
in reference to organizations that have

646
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,929
hundreds of thousands and points that

647
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,510
are not your standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC yeah so Mac</font>

648
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,190
bypass other other series you found

649
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">there good what we've done is a</font>

650
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:58,280
combination of trying to find things

651
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,590
that do as little mac bypass as possible

652
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:05,240
because that can be a huge tax on the

653
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,949
servers and part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

654
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to vendor selection there are some</font>

655
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,280
vendors are going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very effective</font>

656
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,449
with non 8002 dot1x environments and

657
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,320
some that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the pieces so do</font>

658
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have time for one more one more</font>

659
