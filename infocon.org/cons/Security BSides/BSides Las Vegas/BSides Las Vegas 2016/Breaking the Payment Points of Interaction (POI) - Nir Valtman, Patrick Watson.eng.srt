1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
to breaking ground before we get started

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,039
I just want to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> shout out to our</font>

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,160
protiviti and source of knowledge for

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,529
putting helping us put all this on for

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,279

corporation nears the head of

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,010
application security at NCR and Patricks

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,660
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> application security architect with</font>

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,120
NCR and they'll be talking to us today

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,309
about breaking the payment points of

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,760
interaction so gentlemen<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to you</font>

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:51,120
thank you welcome everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's</font>

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,289
a tough hour after lunch but I can

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,589
assure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font>

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,300
really interesting for you because today

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,120
we're talking about breaking payment

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,660
points of interaction and the main thing

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is break few</font>

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,570
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think they may be secure</font>

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,789
so we have a bunch of demos will<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit cards in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lavin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amar environment</font>

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,369
here so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that that you're</font>

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">enjoying so we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,229
introduction the main challenge that we

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">have with this introduction is that we</font>

30
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,000
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our about</font>

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,189
ourselves but we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,500
really limited time so we made an XML

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,949
file that explains who we are I don't

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,130
know if you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read it but we</font>

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,400
just shorten it for you so as I

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,310
mentioned like my name is near and I'm

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,439
heading the application security my

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,680
motto is if you think that security is

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,339
expensive just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ignore it spoke at</font>

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,920
several conferences and I'm an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">source contributor non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick Watson</font>

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,689
I'm application security architect with

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:07,590
NCR and I am a first time speaker so

44
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,538
hooray for b-sides and hooray for me so

45
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,230
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much you're a</font>

46
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:16,980
gracious audience and I've contributed

47
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,010
to a few open source projects openssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,109
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> C URL but not that much mostly</font>

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,879
proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed source stuff you know</font>

50
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">business things I'm sort of the engineer</font>

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,260
the software developer guy so I like to

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">brag about that a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I develop a</font>

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,720
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than year but let's move on</font>

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,319
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,560
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> research so part of our jobs at NCR</font>

56
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,319
is not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that our</font>

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,410
software is secure but to make sure that

58
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,078
the software in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecosystem is secure</font>

59
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,819
so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at other peoples</font>

60
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,720
software and the devices running it

61
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,420
stores or banks or wherever as well part

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,849
of that is sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to actually</font>

63
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,238
disable some of the security alter our

64
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,640
code so that we can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if our</font>

65
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,660
stuff is protecting everybody or if it's

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,578
the protection built<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say pin pads</font>

67
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,579
so that's sort of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did in this</font>

68
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,190
case and lo and behold a whole bunch of

69
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,410
stuff came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that we really didn't</font>

70
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,730
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about but now we do so we</font>

71
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of have to deal with it now let's</font>

72
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the industry a little bit NCR</font>

73
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,349
serves a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you don't</font>

74
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,380
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's we've got</font>

75
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,260
different aspects of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> payment</font>

76
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,160
ecosystem and they all do kind of the

77
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:49,459
same things but you've got retail doing

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,450
it one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospitality that's us hotels</font>

79
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">restaurants that sort of place in</font>

80
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,690
petroleum convenience stores all doing

81
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:59,910
things slightly different now a couple

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago you may have heard of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

83
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,989
very high-profile breaches in the retail

84
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,000
industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the US was</font>

85
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,639
affected in one way or another and

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,500
because of that retail has started

87
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,500
paying a lot more attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

88
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,260
now

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,899
what would you guys say if I told you

90
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,690
that the problems of security and retail

91
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,330
was were solved that people had figured

92
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:30,110
it out and we're good now we can we can

93
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:36,890
go home right and well no not really

94
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that just doesn't know okay so we</font>

95
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

96
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,229
industries and one why we came here but

97
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,030
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the information about how</font>

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hack some stuff I think that you</font>

99
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,429
should understand the architecture that

100
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:55,580
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break so there are</font>

101
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,300
several architecture types that that I

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover especially three that if</font>

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,980
you go to any retail store or you know

104
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,349
hospitality businesses you'll probably

105
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,560
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same architecture with minor</font>

106
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes so the first architecture is</font>

107
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,300
something called the segregated store

108
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,700
architecture it's essentially an

109
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,740
architecture that that you have the

110
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of sales in the store you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

111
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,770
store server and you have the pin pads

112
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,350
so the pin pads the managed pin pads are

113
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:30,620
the ones that can connect to point of

114
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,800
sales using Ethernet cable or just

115
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,200
serial cables in this specific

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,270
architecture you may have firewalls in

117
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,090
the store which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great and you have</font>

118
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,789
your pin pads in some cases you have the

119
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,799
pin pads segregated to specific villain

120
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,460
in the store or a specific villain for

121
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,390
the whole chain whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

122
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,460
one attack vector the other

123
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,880
architectures that we're exploring is

124
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:01,489
the all-in-one solution are all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

125
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,530
store architecture which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

126
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,490
have the pin pad as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned can be</font>

127
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:11,270
connected using serial cables so when

128
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:14,000
you see the malware attacks on pin pads

129
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,460
or on point of sales in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,130
see it in this architecture meeting if

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,349
you have any memory scraper that tries

132
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,150
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the credit card number from the</font>

133
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,039
memory that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

134
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,539
architecture because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the credit</font>

135
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:33,050
card number that is

136
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:35,190
received from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the serial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port so this is</font>

137
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing about this architecture</font>

138
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,950
doesn't think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth mentioning is</font>

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,240
that when you have these memories

140
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:43,469
scrapers on this point of sale

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,940
eventually you will figure this out you

142
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">will see that you have a malware there</font>

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,600
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because there is</font>

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,610
a weak hardware on most point of sales

145
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,500
and member scraping just take CPU so you

146
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,930
will eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that so when you</font>

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,550
scan an item you won't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BIP</font>

148
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,770
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that you'll just</font>

149
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,660
probably hear it a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

150
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,979
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a little bit after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the</font>

151
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,120
last architecture that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover</font>

152
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,710
is fuel stations when is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time</font>

153
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,710
that you saw any fuel station getting

154
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacked well probably didn't hear a lot</font>

155
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it so with kill station architecture</font>

156
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,989
it's even less secure than what you know

157
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,640
or what you here now with fuel

158
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,700
architecture you actually have the fuel

159
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,860
pump which has a pin pad and the fuel

160
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,159
pump is connected to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

161
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,280
adapter the lurch adapter gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 cables</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to it it's a</font>

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,020
proprietary protocol and the layer 2

164
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,810
adapter which in most cases nothing is

165
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,560
authenticated to that then it speaks

166
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:50,160
with a payment application so that's

167
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,810
pretty much was the architecture but

168
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,910
let's talk for a moment about the

169
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,550
payment flow because that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

170
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,200
going to exploit in this talk so a

171
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,380
typical payment flow let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

172
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,090
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into a store and you're</font>

173
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,760
starting to scan the items you scan the

174
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:10,500
items<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually you need to check</font>

175
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,330
out so the cashier press on the pay on

176
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,250
the pay button the pay button eventually

177
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,859
brings you to the payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

178
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,040
the payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> application as I mentioned</font>

179
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be a dll it can be a server that</font>

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,980
gets this request and and eventually the

181
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
payment application controls the pimp at

182
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,900
the point of interaction it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

183
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,570
point of interaction what to do and what

184
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,039
to get from the consumer so the first

185
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that the pain application will ask</font>

186
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,990
will be the credit card data which may

187
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,500
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> track 12 data for those</font>

188
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">no what track 12 means that's the the</font>

189
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,980
data that is reading on the magnetic

190
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,990
stripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your card it can be that or it</font>

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">V tags in case using a chip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and pin</font>

192
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,709
technology so once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it if you're</font>

193
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,569
using a chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pin technology or</font>

194
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:04,390
generally you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin then</font>

195
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,640
again the pointer the payment location

196
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,360
request from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of interaction to</font>

197
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
get a pin receives it back and in online

198
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,250
scenarios it will just submit the

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,760
request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host in order to</font>

200
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:21,130
process the payment in other<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases if</font>

201
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the host is not available it will just</font>

202
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transaction in most cases in</font>

203
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,130
encrypted manner in the payment

204
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,260
application eventually the transaction

205
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:38,080
ends when you get the authorization code

206
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:39,720
and you're checking out so let's start

207
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,970
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the interesting stuff</font>

208
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,529
because now I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that you know</font>

209
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,450
after lunch that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time to give</font>

210
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:51,220
you the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get asleep</font>

211
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,810
now that's the time to get awake so with

212
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,339
the authentication to point of

213
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,660
interactions the first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

214
00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you is the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 adapter</font>

215
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,540
somehow we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a photo of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

216
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:10,180
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me we have access to some stuff</font>

217
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:13,300
and and this is an l2 adapter and cable

218
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,300
called a current loop so<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually if</font>

219
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,810
you're able to tap that you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

220
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see all requests in clear text and do</font>

221
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,209
pretty much whatever you want including

222
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,140
sending your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own requests to the l2</font>

223
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,680
adapter because there is no

224
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,770
authentication error having said that

225
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,410
there is a compensating control because

226
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:37,089
these cables are just under concrete in

227
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,399
the field stations so you won't be able

228
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:42,459
to see these adapters unless someone

229
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:49,270
just made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug a small mistake in the</font>

230
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:51,670
design so our scenario is focuses mainly

231
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,930
on something that called shrimp software

232
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,969
the main idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

233
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,390
men<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle between the payment</font>

234
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,680
application and the point of interaction

235
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,839
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of sale we</font>

236
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,560
don't care how much secure the point of

237
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">sale is all we care about is how to tap</font>

238
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,689
the connection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two</font>

239
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,580
components so by tapping the the

240
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,190
connection with these components we can

241
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,860
do it by you know why shark with tcp/ip

242
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,520
we can do it with serial port monitor

243
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,899
like we can just check what's going on

244
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,180
back and forth and obviously we can just

245
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:33,649
use it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> binary so when I mentioned</font>

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,209
binary it's not a malware binary means

247
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,700
that you take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment application</font>

248
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:40,760
dll make your own changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this dll</font>

249
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,649
and just replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

250
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,779
not a malware and it will not be

251
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,870
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere it will not affect</font>

252
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:50,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance because no one reads the</font>

253
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,820
damn memory no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares about it we</font>

254
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,800
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about getting the credit card</font>

255
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,520
number from the same dll that handles

256
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:04,069
that handles it so take it away pan yes

257
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,140
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

258
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,720
you about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of what we've got</font>

259
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,370
up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you guys can't see it</font>

260
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know especially those of you in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

261
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,700
back we've got my laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is running</font>

262
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,370
a point-of-sale simulator in one of our

263
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,410
payment applications the like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

264
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned early or that payment</font>

265
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,060
application has been modified so some of

266
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,640
its own proprietary security stuff is

267
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,189
disabled that we we concentrate on the

268
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,930
security of the pin pad pause simulator

269
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,880
is just something we use internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

270
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,969
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to lug a giant</font>

271
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,730
point-of-sale round<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a switch we've</font>

272
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,520
got a raspberry pi<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 here which is</font>

273
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,700
running our attack code the man in the

274
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,589
middle part the raspberry pi 3 frankly

275
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,570
is a little bit of overkill for this but

276
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,570
it's fun to have hardware so you know

277
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,160
apparently having a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

278
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,160
technical difficulty with the display

279
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:06,680
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fine finally we've got a</font>

280
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:10,160
pin pad here the law it is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got 80</font>

281
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,079
what we call a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shroud of secrecy over</font>

282
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,060
the pin pad because we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

283
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,480
specifically call out this vendor

284
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,250
there's a lot of pin pad vendors out

285
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,380
there a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different models</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

286
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,870
isn't a vulnerability in a single pin

287
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,770
pad it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a problem in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

288
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system works so now let's go to the</font>

289
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">demo and I believe with this one we're</font>

290
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,250
just swiping a card and seeing if we can

291
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,850
see the track data see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks</font>

292
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,110
like while<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick does it it's</font>

293
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,350
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention that we're running</font>

294
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,170
a production image on this pin pad so

295
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,140
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we disabled some</font>

296
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,360
functionality on the pin pad itself it

297
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,360
just that's the way it works in

298
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,430
production when you pay yeah you could

299
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,130
probably go and find this in a real

300
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,050
store somewhere today they probably

301
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,939
would have prettied up the graphics on

302
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,180
the pin pad screen a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit but</font>

303
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,110
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only difference so let's</font>

304
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:13,040
start a transaction this time let's just

305
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,750
put a deli item on there and if you note

306
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,339
it says please swipe your card so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

307
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,270
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do what's called a</font>

308
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,710
swipe ahead transaction a little tricky

309
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:26,329
to get the card in there with the

310
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy screen in place so swipe ahead</font>

311
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:32,210
is where you swipe the card before the

312
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,800
transaction is complete the reason I'm

313
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that this time is because when</font>

314
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,959
you're doing a swipe ahead transaction

315
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:41,990
you can actually easily see track<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 and</font>

316
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 both of them versus with this an EMV</font>

317
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,750
enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pad when you complete the</font>

318
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,270
transaction it goes into EMV mode and

319
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,400
then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really only see track 2</font>

320
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:55,150
i'll show you a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

321
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,150
later but

322
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,018
in the slot

323
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:15,949
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a sale it's a live demo so</font>

324
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:17,839
you'll need to understand that said this

325
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:21,399
looks like in real data here this is the

326
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,399
EMV screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

327
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:32,358
there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now it's swiped</font>

328
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:34,009
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look over there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

329
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:37,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">Raspberry Pi we've captured the entire</font>

330
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:42,289
track data it's complete out the sale

331
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:49,039
things there we go and near if you could

332
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:56,629
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up wireshark for me so it's adjust</font>

333
00:15:49,039 --> 00:16:03,519
this here where's the thingy well we

334
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:03,519
need to enlarge it again ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

335
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,790
so here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin pad</font>

336
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,829
makes a request<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the man metal manda</font>

337
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle requests to the pause simulator</font>

338
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:16,029
so it's passing the data through so

339
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,360
let's scroll over here to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

340
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:21,910
here is that same track data in plain

341
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,829
text that you saw up here on the

342
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,170
Raspberry Pi so from the track data

343
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:32,050
perspective pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> darn easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capture</font>

344
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that was easy except the</font>

345
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:40,089
swiping stuff yeah the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

346
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,410
saw in our case that it's not encrypted

347
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:47,529
in fact in most cases it's not encrypted

348
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:51,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that or at least in you</font>

349
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:54,490
know in network communications is first

350
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,880
of all the point of sales running legacy

351
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,170
operating system sometimes windows XP

352
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,980
and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pin pads are pretty</font>

353
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,230
old but that's not an excuse this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

354
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,990
just affect one time I remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

355
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,150
requested you know to enable TLS one or

356
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,740
two on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pin pads and they said</font>

357
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:19,179
like why we can give us sl3 is that good

358
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:21,640
enough so that's the business

359
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:24,299
justification eventually you know we

360
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,260
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to secure it but eventually</font>

361
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:30,730
hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> have also their own</font>

362
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:33,010
justifications so that was talking about

363
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet man-in-the-middle a passive men</font>

364
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mel which you know everybody knows</font>

365
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:41,379
how to capture packets and wash our<font color="#CCCCCC"> coo</font>

366
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoopty-doo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you might think to</font>

367
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,370
yourself well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about those pin pads</font>

368
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,470
connected via serial ports they're

369
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,379
probably a little more secure right

370
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,410
because it's not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet cable you</font>

371
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:58,299
can't intercept those things right well

372
00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:00,549
no not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because it's a pain to</font>

373
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">carry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around a bunch of pin pads and you</font>

374
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,429
definitely can't switch them in the

375
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a presentation we've got a</font>

376
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:09,700
video here capturing us<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiping the data</font>

377
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,570
while it's connected via serial port

378
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,070
this is some software from Ultima

379
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,570
software called serial port monitor

380
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,149
that's very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this sort of</font>

381
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,479
thing

382
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:22,908
and you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see it on</font>

383
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:27,469
the screen there so we've got another

384
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:29,599
slide here that's blown up in if you

385
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:32,299
recognize it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would have been the</font>

386
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,928
exact same packet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw if we had</font>

387
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:37,549
done the swipe of a head however you get

388
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same stuff when you do the EMV</font>

389
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:43,369
transaction as well point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

390
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:49,339
track one up there starting with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> B</font>

391
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:52,218
and track to further down so not only

392
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:54,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you capture serial port data and if</font>

393
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:59,929
serial port monitor can do it malware or

394
00:18:54,979 --> 00:19:02,690
replace dll can do it too so that was

395
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:09,249
swiping how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are really</font>

396
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:15,619
swiping today let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about EMV</font>

397
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:18,739
that's probably secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a good</font>

398
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:23,809
one so let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what EMV does</font>

399
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:25,669
first Andy does prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a duplication of</font>

400
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,599
the card because it has the chip on the

401
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:32,299
card so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one thing the other</font>

402
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,939
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in case you want to use a</font>

403
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:37,190
stolen card it prevents you to use it

404
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,979
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the chip and pin like you</font>

405
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:46,820
don't know the pin so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be</font>

406
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:49,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to using it that's all let's talk</font>

407
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:53,539
about what he does not do let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

408
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:59,330
someone stole my track data from the

409
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:01,969
card so first of all or let's say even

410
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,309
someone stole my card that's it first of

411
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:06,219
all he can use this card on pin pads

412
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,259
that they are not Chip and PIN enabled

413
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:12,049
so if one if someone steals my chip and

414
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:16,099
pin card he can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other places</font>

415
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:18,499
on e-commerce on like no old pin pads or

416
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,178
even in manual card entry how many times

417
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:22,849
it happens to you that you scan the card

418
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:26,599
and you just can't read it well you just

419
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:28,480
happen here but but eventually that

420
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:33,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a real scenario</font>

421
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,100
the other scenario is actually the fact

422
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can take the track to data from</font>

423
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pin pad and you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to change</font>

424
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one number in this track in order</font>

425
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,280
to make it non capable or swipe card the

426
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,669
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you swipe the card</font>

427
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,280
that the pin pad knows to identify if

428
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:00,070
it's a chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pin card it's not it</font>

429
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,010
reads the card it's not with the chip it

430
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,580
just sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number that says this is</font>

431
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:11,410
one moment this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of the card</font>

432
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,149
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last thing is even if you steal</font>

433
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,309
the car door still the track data you

434
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,870
can come with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a card with an image of a</font>

435
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">chip or a broken trip it doesn't matter</font>

436
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:23,770
when you come to the cashier and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font>

437
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:27,370
to stick your chip and pin card to the

438
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:31,260
pin pad and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it just</font>

439
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:36,540
doesn't work so the cashier can manually

440
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:41,740
fall back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> swipe that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so</font>

441
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,600
envy it's quite old standard should we

442
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,360
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass it if it's like really</font>

443
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">old standard probably so we have three</font>

444
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,678
men in the middle scenarios in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

445
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,020
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> man the middle scenario is</font>

446
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,059
kind of a passive men in the middle the

447
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,679
passive<font color="#E5E5E5"> men in the middle is relatedly</font>

448
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:07,660
simple the main idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to get the EMV</font>

449
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:10,480
data and see if we can see the track

450
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:14,320
data and actually create a credit card

451
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,210
from EMV transaction so the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

452
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,970
first of all inject your men in the

453
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:21,030
middle stuff it can be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dll</font>

454
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,309
or just intercepting the communication

455
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:26,260
so we have the adversary on the left

456
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:31,389
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have the rest as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

457
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,799
had in the regular payment process so

458
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,720
the main idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you're doing</font>

459
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're selling activity is obviously</font>

460
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished then you ask from the paint</font>

461
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,270
application to pay the payment

462
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,660
application will get a credit card

463
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,460
number

464
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,200
request the credit card number from the

465
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">pink pad which eventually will go to the</font>

466
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:53,260
adversary and from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the to the</font>

467
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin pad and then once the consumers</font>

468
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:59,450
sticks the data sticks the card we will

469
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be able to see the full track</font>

470
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,150
data demo in a moment once we see the

471
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,330
data you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue with the whole</font>

472
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:11,060
process including getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip and</font>

473
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:15,470
you finish so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that the best</font>

474
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:18,470
thing to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is just hand it over</font>

475
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:22,190
to Patrick yeah so near if you would

476
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,750
please set up the camera for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so we're</font>

477
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,120
like near said we're going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

478
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,880
regular EMV transaction this time just

479
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see if we can capture the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EMV data</font>

480
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,180
and see what it looks like so let's

481
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,600
start a transaction put a deli item on

482
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:42,380
here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we like delis start a</font>

483
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,709
sale it should prompt for us to insert

484
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:50,570
our card got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard UL test card</font>

485
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:53,510
here insert it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slot it's going</font>

486
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prompt me to accept the transaction</font>

487
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:59,450
amount and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look over there near</font>

488
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,760
it should have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> track data on the</font>

489
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,460
Raspberry Pi at this point you can take

490
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,890
a photo of it but you can't use it it's

491
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,630
a test it's a test card<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I don't</font>

492
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:12,860
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you taking photos of it</font>

493
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,840
it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work yeah and that explanation</font>

494
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,469
took long enough that the pin pad timed

495
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,000
out now now so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can get a</font>

496
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,380
good view of this let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start that over</font>

497
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:29,230
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the transaction start it back</font>

498
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,230
up daily item sale

499
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:40,440
give it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> matte insert accept the</font>

500
00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:43,919
transaction amount now type in our pin

501
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,989
which is for 315 by the way never tell

502
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,979
anybody your PIN but since it's a test

503
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:58,879
card that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay press ENTER and I must</font>

504
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:58,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">have mistyped it it to love them five</font>

505
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:07,019
there we go typed it right that time so

506
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:10,440
approved remove the card and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

507
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:13,499
transaction should process there we go

508
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so now near if you please could</font>

509
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:17,089
you switch the next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

510
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,240
alright so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so that we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

511
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through Wireshark every time and find</font>

512
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,409
the package and all that we pre captured

513
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,010
this for you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the EMV</font>

514
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:40,220
response packet looks like to the

515
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,019
request to get track data essentially so

516
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,730
you can see some stuff over there on the

517
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:45,529
right and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to tell you</font>

518
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,330
that where it says American Express

519
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:49,490
that's called a a ID that's the

520
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,510
application identifier which type of

521
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,760
card it is below that it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> e IPS blah</font>

522
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,440
blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the cardholder name in</font>

523
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case because it's a test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card it's</font>

524
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:05,539
kind of weird-looking now does anybody

525
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:08,269
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here see track data in there near</font>

526
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:10,940
does because I made a deck yeah so we

527
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:18,950
know where it is good we've got one

528
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:23,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">person yep now anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else nope not yet</font>

529
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,639
so in most payment applications it<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

530
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:28,340
is transferred via a ski so you actually

531
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:33,019
see a ski card numbers like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

532
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:36,590
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 3 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah but EMV</font>

533
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:40,159
actually sticks it over in kind of a

534
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:44,570
weird format where they take the actual

535
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:49,010
text representation<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change the</font>

536
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:50,870
binary bites into that representation so

537
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,399
it shows up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way in when you're</font>

538
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at looking at it in hex now that</font>

539
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got the whole track</font>

540
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're available for us from an EMP</font>

541
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,850
transaction now if you look down here at

542
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,769
the bottom of the screen you can see

543
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got it in a couple different</font>

544
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:13,039
colors the red is obviously the card

545
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:16,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">number the purple next to it the 1903 is</font>

546
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,870
the expiration date then in kind of a

547
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,320
orange that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't display all that</font>

548
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,539
great is 201 now get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that what that</font>

549
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in a second and then a whole bunch of</font>

550
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:29,389
discretionary data that depends on what

551
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">type of card it is that 201 is called a</font>

552
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:33,629
service code in the two is a very very

553
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,450
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

554
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,630
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code because that is what lets</font>

555
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:43,260
you know if it's a swipe card or a chip

556
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:46,650
card so when you just swipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

557
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:51,510
tells the pin pad this is a chip card

558
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,860
don't allow the swipe so in the tax

559
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,590
scenarios near was talking about earlier

560
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,629
if you're offline and not being verified

561
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,939
by a host you can switch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two</font>

562
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:04,850
a-one and your PIN pad all except<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

563
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:08,900
transaction so that's great you know we

564
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:13,949
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to get the credit card data</font>

565
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:16,260
great but we're still meeting we're

566
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:21,270
still missing some data we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

567
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:24,150
get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able purchasing</font>

568
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:28,310
online for instance so when you purchase

569
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:33,270
online why do you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enter</font>

570
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:35,790
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly so cvv2 is exactly what</font>

571
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to enter the cb2 is you know</font>

572
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,000
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came with water one</font>

573
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brands but basically it's the</font>

574
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,550
three or four-digit number that you have

575
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,790
in the back of your card or with<font color="#CCCCCC"> MX you</font>

576
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,540
have the four digits in front of it card

577
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,879
that allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform</font>

578
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:55,290
card-not-present transactions meaning

579
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,280
online transactions and and we want to

580
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:05,990
check if we will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the cvv2</font>

581
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:09,510
here with this flow so we found a way

582
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:12,210
surprising let's talk about the active

583
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,310
man the middle attacks so the first act

584
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,490
amend the middle attack is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that</font>

585
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:20,899
compromises the cvv data we have the

586
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:25,110
same flow again doing the payments

587
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:28,020
asking for the cardholder data the EMV

588
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:31,110
tags are sent back to the adversary

589
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,889
which we already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can get</font>

590
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,719
the data from there and then the the

591
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">most important part here is to</font>

592
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,700
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timing so we adversary</font>

593
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:47,159
gets the EMV tags back the diverse re

594
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,880
will not send the EMV tags

595
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,130
back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> payment application until he</font>

596
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,520
gets more data because eventually we

597
00:29:53,130 --> 00:30:00,030
want to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we successfully</font>

598
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:04,650
finish the transaction from that reason

599
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:07,550
the adversary sends another API call to

600
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:12,210
the pin pad the API call will just

601
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:14,760
request the cvv data that it's it's a

602
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,770
built-in functionality within the pin

603
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,930
pads so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to exploit</font>

604
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:23,129
anything we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have additional</font>

605
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:25,260
API call it's nothing essentially we're

606
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:30,360
not exploiting anything we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

607
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:33,600
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the flows so let's take a</font>

608
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,120
look let's take a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cameraman</font>

609
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,010
if you will so once near gets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

610
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,620
up we'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and start the</font>

611
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:46,050
transaction but while he sets it up an

612
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,840
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cvv2 and</font>

613
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:52,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalents from other merchant or a</font>

614
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,929
card brands is in theory the cvv helps

615
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,030
protect online transactions because it's

616
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,100
never encoded anywhere in the actual

617
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,840
data on like the mag stripe or the chip

618
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,560
so that's why it's on the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

619
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,629
car so let's start a transaction let's

620
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,500
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> two deli items on there this time</font>

621
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:15,860
well if it will feel daring start the

622
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:21,660
sale should prompt for entry there goes

623
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:23,520
insert<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chip card and at this point</font>

624
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,010
we've already got the track data over

625
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,020
there in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> raspberry pi now we'll</font>

626
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:32,460
accept the transaction amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

627
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:35,639
prompt me for my pin for 315 and

628
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,310
hopefully I typed it correctly looks

629
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,460
like I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at this a new</font>

630
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,990
prompter that wasn't there before and

631
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,270
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is since this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test card it</font>

632
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,160
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a real cvv2 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

633
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make one up anybody got a</font>

634
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,920
suggestion need three or<font color="#E5E5E5"> four one two</font>

635
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">three four</font>

636
00:31:52,070 --> 00:32:00,030
type that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> processes for a minute the</font>

637
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">Raspberry Pi picks it up and the pin pad</font>

638
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:05,000
approves payment application is none the

639
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,000
wiser

640
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:21,489
okay so that was good enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

641
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:28,159
online payments anyone needs a yacht

642
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:33,109
something but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

643
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:40,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more information what happened if</font>

644
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:44,960
we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin well we can that's</font>

645
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:48,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea so in this flow we're actually</font>

646
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:54,229
doing pretty much the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

647
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:57,139
this case we won't stop in the in the

648
00:32:54,229 --> 00:33:00,200
EMV tags so let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finish</font>

649
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:02,988
together the EMV tags now the payment

650
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,109
application requests for a pin which by

651
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:09,859
the way we avoided in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous flow</font>

652
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:13,218
but we had it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demo so you request</font>

653
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:15,228
a pin or the payment application

654
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:17,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">requests the pin then cryptid pin from</font>

655
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:20,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of interaction the point of</font>

656
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:23,779
interaction responds with a pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

657
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:26,059
adversary and then that versuri does it

658
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:30,580
again before responding with the

659
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:36,279
encrypted pin to the payment application

660
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:39,049
it actually requests a numeric screen

661
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,979
the numeric screen will eventually asked

662
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:45,489
to reenter the pin when it will request

663
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:48,169
to reenter the pin it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> our screen</font>

664
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:53,779
something that we injected into this

665
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:57,409
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we'll get the pin so</font>

666
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:59,210
let's get few pins yep and for times

667
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:03,460
sake I'm going to go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the</font>

668
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,460
transaction couple items on here

669
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:11,739
and once near gets the camera ready so

670
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,168
we've got the couple items on the screen

671
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:22,979
click sale so it'll prompt for the card

672
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:25,538
entry if i can find the slot there it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

673
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,240
now we've got the track data on the

674
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:30,669
Raspberry Pi<font color="#E5E5E5"> except the transaction</font>

675
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,270
amount now here's the real pin entry

676
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:40,270
screen like you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been seeing before</font>

677
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:43,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">4315 push enter and here's a new screen</font>

678
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:48,879
this one's kind of important though now

679
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:51,700
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was at a place I'd know hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

680
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,929
I shouldn't be prompted for this but

681
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:57,520
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN pad what if you're all</font>

682
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,029
security professionals maybe you'll

683
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">catch it maybe you won't but check out</font>

684
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:09,430
the Raspberry Pi it's got the pin number

685
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:12,150
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Joe from the farm down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

686
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:15,549
street not to impinge on farmers but a

687
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:18,039
layman isn't going to know the pin pad

688
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:20,650
shouldn't be doing this and in our

689
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,180
informal testing even in the payments

690
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,510
industry ninety percent of the people

691
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,788
weren't even suspicious of it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

692
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">entered their pin anyway the ones that</font>

693
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:31,690
were suspicious still thought well maybe

694
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,700
i mistyped it's kind of weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

695
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,890
security guys are having me do this demo

696
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,980
and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they typed it in any</font>

697
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,980
way

698
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:54,310
did it hurt the question yes I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

699
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep the questions to the end because we</font>

700
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:59,620
have few more things to cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

701
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:02,860
quickly running out of time yes we'll

702
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:07,810
get together so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that we've got</font>

703
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:12,750
the pin and we've got the cvv these were

704
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:15,130
great demos but in fact you know several

705
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:19,240
poonam poonam interaction manufacturers

706
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:22,540
they actually put some security measures

707
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,509
in these pen is in these pin pads so one

708
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:28,180
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security measures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is do not allow</font>

709
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,620

00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:40,900
list includes please reenter so when you

712
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:44,890
have the screen of enter pin and then

713
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:49,140
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you request to reenter it</font>

714
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:53,140
refers to the pin it's not re-enter your

715
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:56,259
address address which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite difficult</font>

716
00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:00,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter the address there so that's</font>

717
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much what we're exploiting so</font>

718
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,240
let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we bypass the whitelist</font>

719
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:09,069
and and succeeded with that that's great

720
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,930
but in some cases we can't bypass the

721
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:15,180
whitelist because the whitelist is so

722
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:18,490
strict so that's it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up with it</font>

723
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:23,319
not exactly several manufacturers

724
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:27,100
actually allow you to inject a form or a

725
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,050
screen to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software the reason for</font>

726
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is because as Patrick mentioned in</font>

727
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,850
the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk in the reach</font>

728
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,370
in the hospitality and petroleum

729
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:39,790
petroleum and convenience stores they

730
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,830
have their own flows and the pimpette

731
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,840
manufacturers cannot come up with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

732
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:46,210
the flows in retail it's pretty more

733
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,910
pretty much standard but that's what

734
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:53,110
we're we can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

735
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">something available so in order to</font>

736
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,940
bypass the white layer

737
00:37:54,099 --> 00:38:03,450
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a photo with please</font>

738
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:08,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">enter pin that's it and obviously at the</font>

739
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:13,960
control to get a card number so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

740
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:18,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to for us to believe us we</font>

741
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,619
did it too so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick will</font>

742
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,739
demonstrate in a moment one thing that's

743
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth mentioning is that several</font>

744
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:29,950
manufacturers actually have protection

745
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:32,890
against it they request or require a

746
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:38,710
sign forum that designed by the vendor

747
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:42,970
or by the by themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's see how</font>

748
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:45,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">it works so normally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when a attacker is</font>

749
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:47,470
injecting forms like this it would

750
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,058
happen pretty quick so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

751
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,509
actually slow down<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit so you</font>

752
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:55,239
can see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening as smart</font>

753
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:57,910
attacker would also do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part like at</font>

754
00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:00,400
midnight or whenever some time where the

755
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">stores not actually open however with</font>

756
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,950
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin pad models it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible to do</font>

757
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:08,919
it mid transaction although it'd be kind

758
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,390
of crazy so I'm about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to inject a form</font>

759
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:14,549
into the pin pad you should see a

760
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:19,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloading screen and it'll pause there</font>

761
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:23,019
click OK give it a second there it goes

762
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:26,410
now if you saw the progress bar go

763
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:28,180
across there really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fast once it</font>

764
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,769
reached the end that's when a normal pin

765
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,950
pad would have went<font color="#CCCCCC"> right back to the</font>

766
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:36,788
welcome screen this obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> is paused</font>

767
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,200
here so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it but this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

768
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:41,039
would have flashed almost

769
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,519
instantaneously in a real attack now

770
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,710
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and start a transaction</font>

771
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:51,850
start transaction let's put a deli item

772
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:56,610
in a grocery item this time click sale

773
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:56,610
Oh prompts for card entry

774
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,060
except the amount as usual we've got the

775
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:15,690
track date over there enter the pin 2 or

776
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:18,960
3 15 and now we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own custom</font>

777
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,910
screen now obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's really</font>

778
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,740
going to enter their pin in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen</font>

779
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,440
but the point is so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

780
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:29,220
it's a form from us a screen from us

781
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:33,240
it's not a dick come from the pin pad

782
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:35,970
vendor will say that but in all 10 if it

783
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,890
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor well I don't know</font>

784
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I want my face on every transaction</font>

785
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:43,290
out there but to each their own so

786
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,040
remove the card take a look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie</font>

787
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:49,040
we've got the pin again and there we go

788
00:40:53,210 --> 00:41:02,040
now thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you so we've talked</font>

789
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,930
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of stuff here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

790
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,370
other attack vectors are there and I'm

791
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to breeze through this because</font>

792
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're short on time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit you've</font>

793
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,030
probably heard about skimmers before

794
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:15,330
there's still problem we get reports

795
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:17,760
about them happening all the time some

796
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:19,620
of them are incredibly clever<font color="#CCCCCC"> too like I</font>

797
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,150
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to identify them myself</font>

798
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,990
if they were sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here in front</font>

799
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:30,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me point is those are kind of a known</font>

800
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:32,189
thing next is remember this diagram from

801
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:35,609
before we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pin pad over there</font>

802
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">too now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've only really been</font>

803
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,650
taking a look at one application on that

804
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:43,170
pin pad but<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember like most Internet</font>

805
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,420
of Things type devices this is really a

806
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:48,480
computer it's running all kinds of code

807
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,940
on there there's an OS there's a secure

808
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,790
reading and entry device that's kind of

809
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,640
like a TPM and a whole bunch of other

810
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:58,350
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example what if there's</font>

811
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,600
a buffer overflow in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum loading</font>

812
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:04,290
app it's accepting input for just from

813
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:06,480
just so anybody there so maybe there are

814
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,509
other places we can look for attacks as

815
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">well</font>

816
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:16,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll review quickly the mitigations</font>

817
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:20,230
that may be taken by the vendors or like

818
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:22,420
point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> attraction vendors mainly so</font>

819
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:26,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to have a point upon</font>

820
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:30,010
encryption the point encryption should

821
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:34,420
be hardware based and with the pimpette

822
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:35,890
vendors they have few options to encrypt

823
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,140
the data in the hard way they can use it

824
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,670
like in regular memory or they can put

825
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in a separate memory which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

826
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:45,670
secure memory the new vent the new pin

827
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,890
pads the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of them at least</font>

828
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">support the srad functionality which</font>

829
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:52,990
means separate components some separate

830
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,360
hardware component that no sensitive

831
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:59,140
data goes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there the thing is</font>

832
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:02,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pin pad also supports the same</font>

833
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:07,839
functionality we just didn't enable it

834
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:09,700
to do the ass red stuff important to

835
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,530
mention that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peanut vendors they</font>

836
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,870
invest a lot in crypto like it's

837
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:18,310
essentially a crypto product it's a

838
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:22,660
hardware crypto product and and the idea

839
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use strong enough algorithms so</font>

840
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,410
even though you see here Triple DES

841
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,629
which you may think why the hell do you

842
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">have Triple DES on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin pad well</font>

843
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,370
actually it's a triple<font color="#CCCCCC"> test duck but it</font>

844
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:36,460
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for every transaction you</font>

845
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:41,080
have your different key that you encrypt

846
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the transaction itself next thing</font>

847
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:46,450
is obviously preventing remote ferment

848
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,790
downgrades like let's say that we have a

849
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,279
harder encryption on the pin pad we just

850
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:53,290
want to prevent downgrading it to a

851
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:58,180
software encryption like we had this

852
00:43:53,290 --> 00:44:00,790
time if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a whitelist in some</font>

853
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,180
cases you can add your own whitelisted

854
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:07,000
components in this case you'll probably

855
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:10,020
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your trusted root authority</font>

856
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,910
that at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN pad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

857
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,440
in some cases you also have exceptions

858
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,960
of credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card numbers so everything is</font>

859
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,120
encrypted except<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bean ranges</font>

860
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,970
it's a common<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for loyalty</font>

861
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:25,140
memberships

862
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:26,910
and last but not least is including

863
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,500
crypt offline transactions as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cases if you won't be able to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to</font>

866
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:38,329
the host to the processing host you'll

867
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:40,529
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt the data at rest so</font>

868
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:43,049
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the pointer attraction</font>

869
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:45,269
doesn't support it we don't have point

870
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:47,369
encryption doesn't mean that we screwed

871
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:49,919
probably not you can request from the

872
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:53,579
vendors to try to tell asset or at least

873
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSL it with your certificates or just</font>

874
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:56,880
sign all<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of</font>

875
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:59,160
interaction in several cases you will be

876
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:06,180
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can do that for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

877
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:08,788
and as for the consumers well except

878
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:12,680
paying with cash I think you can

879
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:17,369
actually do a few things one of them is

880
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:23,519
do not re-enter pin like ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

881
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:26,640
saw what we can do check what the forms

882
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:28,529
prompt to you in general because

883
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,819
sometimes they may request also<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security</font>

884
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:33,269
numbers and it's something that is

885
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:38,339
acceptable by you know by these pin pads

886
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:41,279
and the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is try to use</font>

887
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:44,538
alternative methods to pay like you know

888
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:47,190
a base payments I'm paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my watch</font>

889
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:49,829
in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone can prompt me to</font>

890
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:53,099
reenter my pin or to get my CDV data

891
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:54,990
well theoretically they may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

892
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,400
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's just worth additional</font>

893
00:45:54,990 --> 00:46:01,258
research we're just keeping some stuff

894
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:04,589
to the next year of<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides so in</font>

895
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">summary it's relatedly easy to exploit</font>

896
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:09,380
point of interactions just because of

897
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,910
the regular flow that we have there and

898
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,240
we can secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of interactions</font>

899
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:18,868
it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of knowing what to</font>

900
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,729
ask from the vendors and that's the time

901
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:22,529
for I don't think we have enough

902
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">question enough time for questions but</font>

903
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,849
we can at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with fellow or</font>

904
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,549
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have time for maybe one or</font>

905
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:32,840
two questions so so first talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

906
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:35,310
guy that mentioned earlier about<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBB to</font>

907
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,260
remember when you're doing an EMV

908
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,060
transaction if your cards in the slot

909
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you pull the card out it'll cancel</font>

910
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,660
the transaction I think that's what he's

911
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,040
probably referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you need</font>

912
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the back of the card for the</font>

913
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,370
CBB to but because this is an active man

914
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,500
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and it can prompt whatever</font>

915
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,970
at once it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it whenever at once so</font>

916
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,580
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can prompt for that before you</font>

917
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:59,129
actually swipe your card the average

918
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer may not even realize that it's</font>

919
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:09,270
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be happening so there</font>

920
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go hold on hold on hi new chunk was</font>

921
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,840
on tonight begin new service I want to

922
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:16,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask when you mentioned about the</font>

923
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,750
prompting cvv data you may you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

924
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,360
it sends an AP call and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in</font>

925
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,970
functionality is this particularly for

926
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,580
the cvv or were you talking about

927
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:29,819
inserting the screen in general because

928
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:33,299
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cpv why why is this</font>

929
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">functionality there doesn't settle go</font>

930
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,130
ahead it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of both so the</font>

931
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:40,590
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when we were asking for</font>

932
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">cvv2 and we said that was a built-in API</font>

933
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:47,010
car call where we talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

934
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,780
prompt itself or specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> place cvv2 so</font>

935
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,450
what's actually going on there as we use

936
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,950
a screen or for more input method

937
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,230
whatever you want to call it called get

938
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:59,160
numeric<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that it allows you to</font>

939
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:01,290
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of texts to prompt with so</font>

940
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,620
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just ask for basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

941
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:06,300
we want there is customizable yes what

942
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,790
near had mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> at park in part of</font>

943
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,850
the talk was there is in some pin pads a

944
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:16,590
white list of allowable prompts inner

945
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:19,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">cvv2 is one of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed prompts in</font>

946
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,020
some cases you just need to to perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">card not present transaction so it's</font>
