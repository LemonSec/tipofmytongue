4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,740
escalation how commodity programs are

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,600
evolving and getting into advanced

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,890
threat we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker Israel Barack</font>

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:30,980
please put your hands together and

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:30,980
welcome our speaker thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,500
good afternoon guys my name is Israel it

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:43,800
kind of gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> away my country of origin</font>

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,550
you know I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Boston and when I</font>

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,860
landed<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in not in Vegas I got out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,780
the airplane I felt a nice breeze

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,260
outside it kind of get gave me a good

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,030
feel of home so you know it's great to

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">be at to be here today we're going to</font>

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:08,540
talk a little bit about processes in

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,580
which we see a commodity malware or

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,600
low-level threats that we are usually

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,670
used to thinking of as untargeted

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,390
convert and convert very fast actually

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,130
to highly targeted operations and we're

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss a little bit the</font>

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,820
question of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we should</font>

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,670
classify incidents or threats that we

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,439
see in to targeted versus untargeted as

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,950
per our instant response methodology

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:45,449
specifically specifically we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,329
talk about how black market trafficking

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,009
of compromised enterprise computing

31
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:55,919
resources actually effects our instant

32
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,700
detection and response procedures right

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,420
this phenomenon is actually what

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,540
supports this rapid conversion of many

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,940
so-called untargeted threats into

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,270
targeted ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll drill down into</font>

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of the industry as much as</font>

38
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,260
our time permits

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,030
so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a new incident is</font>

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,840
detected traditionally before we were

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,470
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to using the term targeted</font>

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,560
typically security executives the CSO or

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,410
the sock manager would try to estimate

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the impact of the incident is on</font>

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:47,519
availability of services on data

46
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:51,690
organizational data and based on this

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,710
try to gauge the importance of the

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,200
response to that incident now at some

49
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,110
point generally pretty much every piece

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,799
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware in the market including click</font>

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,750
fraud and add were kind of converted

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,480
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a full-blown</font>

53
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,540
remote access tool and so the general

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,070
question of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential impact</font>

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the piece of malware that we're</font>

56
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,769
seeing here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

57
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,500
services or potential data loss in the

58
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,180
organization the answer was well there's

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,850
definitely a potential right the tool is

60
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,770
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that answer</font>

61
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,170
was not something that organizations

62
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,890
could manage their priorities<font color="#CCCCCC"> asian</font>

63
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:38,910
processes was and so people kind of

64
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,130
tended to adopt the term targeted right

65
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,220
and the question became is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

66
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,500
targeted threat or an untargeted threat

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:52,019
that we're seeing here ie trying to

68
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,410
gauge the level of probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

69
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,920
attacker actually intends right to steal

70
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,519
data off of the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> crippled</font>

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,070
organizational capabilities as opposed

72
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,920
to something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user kind of</font>

73
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote/unquote randomly caught as they</font>

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,349
were browsing the web or reading their

75
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:19,730
email but what we're going to see is and

76
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,430
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about is how</font>

77
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:26,950
commodity mal were right can quickly

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,370
transform into a very targeted

79
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,229
operation which can happen based on some

80
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,020
processes that will see here between

81
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:47,110
hours and days from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment of of</font>

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:50,380
infection to address this topic we would

83
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,140
first talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black market</font>

84
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,020
machine trading industry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll drill</font>

85
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,120
down into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a good feel for</font>

86
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,240
what a black market for machine trading

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,450
is how it works the exact methods of

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,140
operation and what the targeted attacker

89
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:11,800
can find in one of those platforms we'll

90
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:15,070
look at the processes for evaluation how

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,550
do seller is<font color="#CCCCCC"> value eight machines and as</font>

92
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,140
a result of that what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics of what they would do</font>

94
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,650
when they offer machines for sale we

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,470
would see what kind of tool sets these

96
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,849
sort of marketplaces offer the sellers

97
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,070
and buyers as they transact and we'll

98
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools techniques</font>

99
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,890
and practices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are common to this</font>

100
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,729
triangle of sellers market places and

101
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:48,729
buyers right as they transact will

102
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,580
review a specific case<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific threat</font>

103
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,490
that we've analyzed from the attacked

104
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations perspective in which the</font>

105
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,760
commodity malware is operator actually

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">offered it for sale and and went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of being sold to a targeted</font>

108
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,099
actor and we'll see how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks from</font>

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,760
the attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations perspective</font>

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:17,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of summarize all that</font>

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,380
conclusions on how security<font color="#CCCCCC"> operation</font>

113
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">centers can actually detect that these</font>

114
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,620

116
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:39,780

Citigroup at a later stage and I'm

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress let me direct the</font>

question to you guys have if you guys

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:27,029
had a chance any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys chew buy or</font>

132
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:34,110
sell compromised servers or endpoints

133
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:36,930
online anyone let's go would buy you

134
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:41,900
know it's the more the less sell less

135
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:46,919
less problematic position<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in so no</font>

136
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:50,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I'll devote a substantial amount</font>

137
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,039
of our conversation here to understand

138
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:55,080
exactly how these marketplaces work and

139
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,628
what you would see both as a buyer and

140
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:03,750
as a seller when you transact with these

141
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:07,940
marketplaces one of you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my in my</font>

142
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:12,839
perspective one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

143
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:15,419
market places for for the trading of

compromise compromise servers and end

145
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:25,500
points today is called ecstatic have you

146
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:27,539
heard the term the word the name so one

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,029
thing I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest before we drill</font>

148
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,750
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper into this I would advise</font>

149
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:35,939
every security professional to get very

150
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,679
acquaintance with these platforms just

151
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,659
like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting very acquaintance</font>

152
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,328
with attack tools and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen testing</font>

153
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,789
platforms going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> these platforms and</font>

154
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:45,939
understand

155
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,730
how people<font color="#E5E5E5"> put servers and end points</font>

156
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,890
for sale and how does the toolset work

157
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,780
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the process of transacting</font>

158
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,720
between by a nurse buyer and a seller

159
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:59,140
works I think it's it's fundamental to

160
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,680
the understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how attackers can</font>

161
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,870
get a direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> line into the organization</font>

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,199
without going through phishing attacks

163
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,360
right or watering hole or malicious

164
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,150
attachments they can just get a server

165
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,890
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data center with five minutes of</font>

166
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,750
work we'll see exactly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works</font>

167
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,000
but I would advise every one of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

168
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,930
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that takes to interest in this</font>

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,410
to try to platform you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also see the</font>

170
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,459
URL they're ecstatic biz it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even a</font>

171
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,160
tour domain it's right out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

172
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,530
so the business has<font color="#CCCCCC"> commoditised people</font>

173
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,050
like ecstatic have really<font color="#CCCCCC"> commoditised</font>

174
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:42,610
the business of transacting on

175
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,829
compromised enterprise resources and

176
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll see exactly how how much they've</font>

177
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">commoditised this market as we as we go</font>

178
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:57,219
in so one note here before we go in some

179
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,660
terminology compromised machines on

180
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,790
these platforms are typically not

181
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">referred to as machines are typically</font>

182
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:07,689
referred to as our dps or SS h's<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

183
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,280
selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buying our dps right</font>

184
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,770
typically it's because these are the

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,689
most common communication protocols that

186
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:20,370
you would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> machines and</font>

187
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:26,830
we'll talk about the reasons for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:29,430
so let's look at what we have here<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

189
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">text etic</font>

190
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,990
I don't know how well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font>

191
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,850
especially in the back lines there but

192
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:47,220
there's a legal notice here at the

193
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:47,220
bottom can you see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here</font>

194
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,939
resolution is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so great but let me</font>

195
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:58,120
read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you says warning sure</font>

196
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,920
company representative and one check can

197
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,160
really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear the thick Russian</font>

198
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,910
accent there and one check your firm IPS

199
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:13,089
for existence in our database send<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

200
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,610
to provide your firm IP etc etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font>

201
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:18,010
I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if you want to check if</font>

202
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,810
you're part of our database just send us

203
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,689
an email what do you think by the way

204
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,550
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if you sent them an email</font>

205
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:27,700
sorry of course you're part of the

206
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,069
database right there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15,000 us</font>

207
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,330
machines on that platform every day of

208
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,590
the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you're in their</font>

209
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:41,110
database by the way but what else would

210
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me tell you something and</font>

211
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's something interesting and</font>

212
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,050
you kind of get to learn this as you

213
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,900
work with those guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's such a</font>

214
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,599
thing as honor between thieves right if

215
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,340
they say something they mean it right if

216
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,380
they say that they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you</font>

217
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,790
off their data set or off their database

218
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,820
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get you off their</font>

219
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,800
database but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

220
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,050
second after you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

221
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,060
their 12 other databases that appear

222
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:10,030
under a different name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not ecstatic</font>

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,250
that exact that actually is exactly

224
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,170
what's happening right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they will take</font>

225
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,300
you off and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of</font>

226
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,819
creative interpretation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

227
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,750
reality of what would make them not be

228
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:28,780
liable for these transactions anyway

229
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:31,090
just an anecdote let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to register</font>

230
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,610
an account well it says you're a

231
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:36,370
worrying to get the access in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shop</font>

232
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,650
after registration need to load five

233
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,930
hundred bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and only after this you'd</font>

234
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,930
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a site whatever</font>

235
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:54,110
so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here</font>

236
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is they you know they like to use tools</font>

237
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,080
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> jabber for for communication</font>

238
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,960
typically it's perceived as a relatively

239
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,540
private or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> living privacy oriented</font>

240
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,790
tool and here on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom there's a</font>

241
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,339
reference part right as part of the

242
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,949
registration process the question is how

243
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,060
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find us who recommends it's kind</font>

244
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,520
of a remnant of the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of</font>

245
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,750
compromise resource training in

246
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,050
actuality there are so many people

247
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this operation it doesn't</font>

248
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,640
take any effort right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find someone</font>

249
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,070
that fits this profile of someone who

250
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:41,449
recommends you it's pretty easily you

251
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:43,940
can you can go in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're in so one</font>

252
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:48,290
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do here is we</font>

253
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,110
can scroll through a list of compromised

254
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,620
machines here and kind of pick and

255
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:58,100
choose what we want to buy on an average

256
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,710
day worldwide you'd find<font color="#E5E5E5"> between thirty</font>

257
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,650
and forty thousand machines on this

258
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,360
platform on ecstatic similar number you

259
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,410
would find on platforms like he way s

260
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,850
like black cash so a couple of hundred

261
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,680
machines they're pretty unique by the

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,780
way and they don't interchange right

263
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,030
they don't they don't contain the same

264
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,220
the same machines on on multiple

265
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,230
platforms are pretty synchronized so a

266
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,150
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred machine 100,000 machines</font>

267
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,260
worldwide on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this between</font>

268
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thirty and forty thousand a day but</font>

269
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,960
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we and you obviously you can</font>

270
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,310
search for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> choice based</font>

271
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,200
on the type of provider that you're

272
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain access into region etc</font>

273
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,330
etc but maybe before we kind of sink our

274
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,980
teeth into this into the actual meat

275
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,490
that we have here that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the toolset</font>

276
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,400
that they offer and the actual machines

277
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,459
are for sale let's look at a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font>

278
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,920
of wisdom for this from this marketplace

279
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,439
operator and the idea again<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font>

280
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,819
out understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> State of Mind</font>

281
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand the TTP's the methods of</font>

282
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,929
operation that will help us at the end

283
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,360
to figure out how we can detect these

284
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:13,249
processes happening in an enterprise

285
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:18,139
environment so let's look at a few words

286
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:20,029
of wisdom code of conduct right there is

287
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:25,369
such a thing even with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with a black</font>

288
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:30,139
market like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this essentially what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

289
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:33,559
see here is a set of simple rules but I

290
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,759
think in an inch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's they</font>

291
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,449
basically define<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the value</font>

292
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,610
proposition of why would you buy our dps

293
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and why specifically would you buy our</font>

294
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:51,319
dps from ecstatic I think it's

295
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:56,779
interesting to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that last line here</font>

296
00:15:51,319 --> 00:16:01,189
just as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a an anecdote of stolen in fro</font>

297
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:03,829
from our dps yes many our dps<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

298
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:06,949
useful info about people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and companies</font>

299
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:09,378
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be sold at black markets at a</font>

300
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:13,069
big price again a thick Russian accent

301
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:17,990
there you can kind of imagine that the

302
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:27,110
writer there but but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

303
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:31,129
part right a value proposition so next

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:36,139
thing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people get our dps is using</font>

305
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:39,549
rdp is legal all our dps what can be

306
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:46,790
found in internet forums is not legal

307
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:50,299
right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're saying is they</font>

308
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,939
give you this this sort of tips right

309
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:56,600
and they say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful with an</font>

310
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:58,929
rdp using main rules is if possible

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Petra rdp we'll look at those tools in</font>

312
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:04,129
in a moment these marketplaces and

313
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,579
ecstatic specifically offer a specific

314
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,870
set of value-added built built

315
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,490
independently built tools

316
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,589
to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value of transacting</font>

317
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,870
through them we'll look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the these</font>

318
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,220
tools the patch rdp and create your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

319
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:21,109
account at it and etc etc not really

320
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,640
using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> real IP when you connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

your bought our teepees

322
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:38,490
another set of interesting words of

323
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,590
wisdom here basically saying we're not

324
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the owners of those already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Peas we</font>

325
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,240
don't know where they came from and who

326
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,580
they are right it will see these

327
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,889
translate into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the search processes</font>

328
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,049
right when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start when you search for</font>

329
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:53,779
specific targets you don't necessarily

330
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,860
search by name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization</font>

331
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:59,580
because they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be perceived</font>

332
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:10,019
as knowing who this asset originally

333
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:11,820
belonged to right fair price trading of

334
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:14,580
course you buy and sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a fair price</font>

335
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on their understanding of what a</font>

336
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,678
fair price is interesting concept

337
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,899
they've actually introduced this concept

338
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,049
into the market you can be become a

339
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:27,059
reseller right so if you buy a set of

340
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,759
our dps and you don't need them anymore

341
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:33,480
you can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the platform and sell</font>

342
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,509
them is bud obviously you can see here

343
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,070
but don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so happy yet right there</font>

344
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,220
are a bunch of caveats here caveat

345
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,049
number one eighty percent commission and

346
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,149
there are a bunch of other ones right

347
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:48,480
but it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a growing market</font>

348
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:50,309
reselling of purchase ID pieces is a

349
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,710
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> market and the next etic is</font>

350
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:58,918
really pioneering that market okay next

351
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,629
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code of conduct and that's what</font>

352
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,809
I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is really they've</font>

353
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:05,908
taken read the manual procedure

354
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:08,340
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> really where it should be and you</font>

355
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:10,950
can see in the middle we checked your

356
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,168
request typically my credentials don't

357
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,590
work where my IP doesn't work I can't

358
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:19,860
connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ba the RDP that I bought</font>

359
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,918
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we check if we checked it and it</font>

360
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:25,168
turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be false and user just</font>

361
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:31,049
user is stupid or too lazy to read this

362
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:34,470
right by this the FAQ right first the

363
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:37,049
first strike warning second strike we

364
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,970
deduct money off of your account third

365
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,990
strike we take all the remaining balance

366
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,290
in your account and you're adding here

367
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,390
so they've really taken the read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual into the the appropriate</font>

369
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,429
level right think what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen if</font>

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,300
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this method in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

371
00:19:51,429 --> 00:20:00,070

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of conduct and that kind of gives us an</font>

373
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,010
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you actually buy from the</font>

374
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:09,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">platform what you actually buy is an IP</font>

375
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,360
address a port number a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

376
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,640
password so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buy the</font>

377
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,860
seller is really responsible to set up

378
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,190
whatever is required in the background

379
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,800
for you as a buyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to this to</font>

380
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,230
an rdp based on these connection

381
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,809
parameters and be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect your</font>

382
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,540
bought machines will talk about the

383
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:34,030
implication of this as we model our

384
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,290
detection strategy right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

385
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:42,070
very now that we've seen this we can

386
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,720
assume a lot on how the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

387
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,389
control infrastructure would look like

388
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,040
whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be tasking base or</font>

389
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,860
it's going to be a heavyweight protocol

390
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:58,300
and we'll talk about this a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

391
00:20:50,860 --> 00:21:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">on in more details ok let's talk a</font>

392
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,230
little bit about the tool sets that a

393
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,520
platform like ecstatic there by the way

394
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,770
that different platforms are pretty

395
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,350
similar in the type of tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

396
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:12,129
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer so a platform like</font>

397
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,219
ecstatic offers tools that would ease

398
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,650
the transaction of buying an rdp and

399
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:22,300
increase the value that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buyer can</font>

400
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:24,550
get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bought asset so this tool</font>

401
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,139
specifically is a tool to convert a

402
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:32,080
bought RDP into an anonymous proxy a

403
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">socks socks service basically wrapped up</font>

404
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:42,070
into a fairly fairly straightforward you

405
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:43,960
I next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is our DP log cleaner so if</font>

406
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,669
you bought an rdp you want to make sure

407
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you cover your tracks after each</font>

408
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,640
session that you get this nice tool here

409
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,000
but really the more interesting stuff

410
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,250
are the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> two tools</font>

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,200
this tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually helps you evaluate if</font>

412
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,200
you're the server or<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint that</font>

413
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,390
you're about to buy as blacklisted by

414
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,660
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

415
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,510
buy an rdp that you wouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

416
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,480
use and so they run it through throb

417
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:18,900
detection mechanism to see if anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

418
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,080
actually blacklisted that IP whether it

419
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for spam or financial fraud or credit</font>

420
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,929
card related fraud or anything else so

421
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,270
that's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a paid service are</font>

422
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:37,860
you paper per transaction in this case

423
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:40,830
at a big deal 25 cents another tool they

424
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,850
offer is to make the most out of end

425
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,159
point rd<font color="#E5E5E5"> peas the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about our DP</font>

426
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,469
obviously where the windows endpoint

427
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,660
machine is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't have</font>

428
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,330
concurrent connections are the same user

429
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,900
right so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font>

430
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:00,149
user is trying to login as administrator

431
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,730
they would kick each other out and so

432
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,730
the question is how do i buy an RDP into

433
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,650
a Windows 10 machine and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I connect</font>

434
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,840
us in the administrator that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am after</font>

435
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,490
all I bought it I don't connect the

436
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,050
legitimate administrator said they would

437
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,180
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone else is using that</font>

438
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:18,149
machine and would they connect they

439
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,520
don't kick me out and so these guys as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

440
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etic they both a patch for rnap</font>

441
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,170
that's for the seller is typically to

442
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,680
install what it does it basically

443
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">patches the RDP service so multiple</font>

444
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,740
connections of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scene user can exist</font>

445
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,960
on that machine and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the type</font>

446
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,880
of tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would find in a large</font>

447
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,940
in a large market place like like

448
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,840
ecstatic any questions

449
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,840
two

450
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's look at the a few actual</font>

451
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:01,649
server list right and see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works</font>

452
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,930
the first thing you do you know the

453
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,360
typical targeted attacker is is kind of

454
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,040
like a kid in a candy store here right a

455
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,409
lot of targeted attackers don't

456
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,570
necessarily come into that store looking

457
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,540
for a specific organization organization

458
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">next many of them come into that store</font>

459
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,970
because they look for intellectual

460
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:23,070
property or they look for credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font>

461
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,710
information or they look for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Social</font>

462
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Security numbers or they look for health</font>

463
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> related informations or medical</font>

464
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,590
insurance information and a variety of

465
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,210
targets would fit their profile they

466
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,570
just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what opportunities</font>

467
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,150
exist here and so they go into this

468
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,129
platform and they start looking around

469
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:46,920
so if you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know I</font>

470
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,160
want machines in specific organizations

471
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,860
you know I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here but you</font>

472
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,840
can find eyes like t-mobile us you want

473
00:24:52,860 --> 00:25:01,100
a scene with t-mobile it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

474
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:04,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sound their list if you keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

475
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:10,830
if you're interested in in in verizon

476
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:12,929
it's also not a problem if you're

477
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:19,290
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety of bings there's</font>

478
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:20,820
a long list here when you look at kind

479
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of filter all the machines that they</font>

480
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,679
have worldwide into u.s. machines only

481
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:32,670
well about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week ago this filtered to</font>

482
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,800
about 15,000 machines in the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

483
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">combination of servers and end points</font>

484
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,840
and points are<font color="#CCCCCC"> about fifteen to twenty</font>

485
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:46,260
percent of that the restro servers a big

486
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:51,000
mess of that would be on cloud cloud

487
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:52,800
providers AWS as your IBM Rackspace

488
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,840
other would be physical servers

489
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,970
distributed all around the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

490
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,980
you can check it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> i invite you to</font>

491
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,720
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the list and see if you</font>

492
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,790
want to buy something

493
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,490
but let's look at specific examples and

494
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:13,180
see how simple that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have here a</font>

495
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:18,570
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being resold by someone</font>

496
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:23,950
for three dollars in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Washington Seattle</font>

497
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:27,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">University of Washington and if anyone's</font>

498
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,750
interested it has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> added value feature</font>

499
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,690
here right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see how they</font>

500
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,550
build the value right in this case they

501
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,770
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not only in the</font>

502
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,200
University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Washington so if you're</font>

503
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,879
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in at stealing intellectual</font>

504
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,180
property that's probably a good base for

505
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to start in we also tell you which</font>

506
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,730
software which software tools are

507
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,310
deployed on this machine which websites

508
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,320
they visit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

509
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials cached on those machines for</font>

510
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,360
these websites<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they tell</font>

511
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point-of-sale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine in the</font>

512
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,399
University<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Washington may be in the</font>

513
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,740
student registration office so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

514
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,930
kind of enjoy a world right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can try</font>

515
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,780
to take this machine for intellectual

516
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,520
property writing for data breach or it

517
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:21,280
can try to just steal credit cards off

518
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:25,080
that machine and let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font>

519
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">another example in this case a server</font>

520
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:36,250
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phoenix sold for fourteen dollars</font>

521
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy sweet anyone know who's who these</font>

522
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:43,900
guys are credit card processing services

523
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,060
if you want to buy a server in their

524
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:52,440
processing service<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sold for</font>

525
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:52,440
fourteen dollars right now so

526
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,620
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bristow words</font>

529
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,809
farm Mike Microsoft informatica so if

530
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,270
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in intellectual</font>

531

property from those guys if you're

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,370
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> to potentially she change</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they just go in then they click</font>

539
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,120
buy buy buy buy buy an attractive

540
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:40,290
machine would disappear from this

541
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:46,330
platform within two to three hours and

542
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:48,879
when we go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the security</font>

543

operations center organization that

running on one of their machines and

546
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,660
deprioritize that incident to the bottom

547
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:02,890
of the list to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taken care of maybe</font>

548
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:05,740
next week and you consider the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

549
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,050
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine exists in an interesting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operates this adder is sophisticated</font>

552
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,280
enough to have a server or machinery

553
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,410
selling operation and most of them do

554
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,389
especially the sophisticated ones it's

555
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:21,970
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sold for a much more</font>

556
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,760
targeted actor than that adware operator

557
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,890
in less than three hours and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

558
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,480
buyer is going to do is it's a different

question and when they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

business

599
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:51,830
any questions on what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen here</font>

600
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:53,360
before we move on sorry you could pay in

601
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,929
different currencies you can paid in

602
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,669
bitcoins if you want but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

603
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,800
when you charge your account everything

<font color="#CCCCCC">gets converted to dollars whichever</font>

605

currency you pay it gets converted to

606
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,860
dollars in your wallet and then you use

607
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,910
whatever you have in your wallet to buy

608
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">those resources the question was why is</font>

609
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:23,210
the currency here dollar is a not stuff

610
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:25,720
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin interestingly enough these</font>

611
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,730
platforms adopt a lot of the e-commerce

612

practices as it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifying</font>

613
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:35,810
fraud so if you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use anonymous</font>

614
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,430
proxies to pay those guys you would see

615
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in most cases they would block you</font>

616
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,570
because they're concerned as anyone else

617
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,100
that they're the money that they've

618
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,750
given you or the credit if they've given

00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:07,420
other questions on what we see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

625
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:21,789
so a few a few statistics right just to

626
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,979
get a feel for what the numbers are and

627
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,629
you've you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already got a sense for</font>

628
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,950
what the numbers are but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

629
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:33,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what aspects of the resource</font>

630
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,620
that's being sold impact the price<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

631
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,190
would impact the actions that we would

632
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,899
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seller is doing as they prepare</font>

633
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,799
a machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sale because they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

634
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:48,220
up the value as much as possible so the

635
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:52,360
most basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> features that would up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

636
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,580
price by approximately fifty percent on

637
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,449
the commodity price which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to ten</font>

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,570
dollars per machine admin privileges

639
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:04,210
that's that saves a little time public

640
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,418
IP that means I can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can use</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that machine for setting up proxies VPN</font>

642

<font color="#E5E5E5">and network bandwidth it has to be a</font>

646
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,339
significant amount of network bandwidth

647
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:27,280
to actually impact that price next level

648
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">which would add between fifty percent</font>

649

and a thousand percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the sales</font>

650
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,330
price is the type of software that's

651
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:36,520
installed on the machine and the

652
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:39,790
applications are typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites that</font>

653
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:43,060
had accessed actually suggesting the

656
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:51,429
it if I see access to multiple banking

659
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:59,830
nice impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the price the jackpot</font>

660
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,630
just like we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen with our friend</font>

661
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">there mr. Obama is enterprise</font>

662

affiliation that would have a massive

663
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:10,509
impact on the sales price and that is

664
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,790
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would see crime organizations</font>

665
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:16,060
like the one that operate adware or

666
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:19,210
click fraud tools devote a specific part

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their operation just to go over the</font>

every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

671
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,270
is worth especially the enterprise

672
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,340
associated ones and putting them out for

673
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,960
a sail because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a typical click fraud</font>

674
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,910
from a typical click fraud machine

675
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,700
across its lifetime you would make

676
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">summer between five dollars and twenty</font>

677
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:44,089
dollars per machine but if you can sell

678
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:48,740
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for a thousand dollars or $1,500</font>

679
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:51,020
some machines are sold for 357 then it's

680
00:35:48,740 --> 00:36:00,830
a major difference in your revenue

681
00:35:51,020 --> 00:36:03,590
stream so just kind of a last anecdote

682
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:08,240
on the data that we've seen off of this

683
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:11,359
off of this platform the top five states

684
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,180
in the country that host compromised

685
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,890
machines for sale<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you the</font>

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,368
first four and i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to take</font>

687
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,980
gases for the fifth number one is a

688
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:25,970
state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> California twenty one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

689
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:28,940
of the US based machines offer for sale

690
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,850
are actually based in California New

691
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:35,810
Jersey continues to list New York and

692
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:46,460
Texas who would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say is the fifth</font>

693
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:52,900
state sorry nope nope nope it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

694
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:52,900
be amazing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that amazing no</font>

695
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:04,730
go figure go figure in it but it is what

696
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is they have the exact same</font>

697
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:20,960
percentage as Texas in New York so I

698
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:23,299
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> why that is yeah well there</font>

699
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,010
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I just thought it was kind of a</font>

700
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">sovereign approach to succeed</font>

701
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:38,359
cybersecurity<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that look</font>

702
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,359
like when this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

703
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in an enterprise network from</font>

704
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,340
the attacked organization point of view

705
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,779
so we're going to talk a little bit

706
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:54,760
about a set of incidents that we've seen

707
00:37:49,780 --> 00:38:00,590
that happened with a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of</font>

708
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:02,780
click fraud organization so typically in

709
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,570
an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and we've seen</font>

710
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:08,750
multiple cases of the same of the same

711
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:11,180
the same process driven by the same

712
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,670
actor we typically start with an

713
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,669
untargeted in this case it was an

714
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:19,040
unknown file s click fraud tool that

715
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:23,180
affects several and several machines in

716
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,820
the enterprise network typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

717
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,540
detection here was based on malicious

718
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,940
use of PowerShell and malware

719
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:37,970
communicating with known let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just see</font>

720
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:39,710
two domains or ip's almost instantly

721
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,799
right when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see this drawer of</font>

722
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:46,190
characteristic it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets deprioritized by</font>

723
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,900
by a typical sock right there are you

724
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are worst types of malware</font>

725
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,130
there are more targeted operations this

726
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,859
is just a quick fraud tool you can see

00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:21,160
few detection mechanisms that can help

877
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:23,370
us surface right that these processes

878
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,379
are taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> place right obviously as</font>

start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to have a mechanism</font>

883
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:41,290
in place that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to revisit ad</font>

00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:43,600
prioritized incident and understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

885
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,779
what we've deprioritized a week ago is

886
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,819
now something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different is going</font>

887
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">through a very different process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

888
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:56,350
should probably reconsider its prior is

889
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:01,480
a shin for for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mediation so obviously</font>

890
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:06,100
changes of in the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> control I any</font>

891
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,350
changes from a known infrastructure to

892
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,110
an unknown infrastructure is definitely

893
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:14,200
an indicator it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it means that</font>

894
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:16,740
it's worth more to the seller converting

895
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:22,379
from straight IP to a domain generation

896
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:24,910
any connections that are to rdp service

897
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,760
especially on already compromised

898
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,710
machines right and connections the RDP

909

privileges we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it in</font>

910
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:08,589
identifying enumeration processes of

911
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:11,200
browser history and installed pieces of

912
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:13,719
software right as an indicator again on

913
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,450
machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've already seen a</font>

914
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:17,950
malicious process running on so we know

915
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,749
that they have the potential of going

916
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,089
through this process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

917
00:48:19,749 --> 00:48:23,589
identify these indicators that would

918
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:27,969
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something is potentially</font>

919
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:32,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on and something that was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

920
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:35,559
bit interesting kind of to us is we

921
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:37,630
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when a seller prepares a</font>

922
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,269
machine for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sale they would stop the</font>

923
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,799
thing that their use of that machine so

924
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:44,379
if they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for click fraud</font>

925
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:46,809
they would stop that click fraud prior

926
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,109
to transacting apparently it's almost

927
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:52,900
never the case the seller continues

928
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:56,109
their operation and in many cases buyers

929
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,869
by the asset when the previous operation

930
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:00,609
is actually still<font color="#CCCCCC"> in process so the</font>

931
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:04,209
assumption of we're going to see a

932
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:06,640
cessation of the previous behavior prior

933
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:13,469
to that transaction is actually not a

934
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:13,469
very good indicator any questions

935
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so either it was very good or very</font>

936
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:34,120
bad either I was very clear or very

937
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:37,060
unclear what do you think yeah so you

938
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,240
focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows obviously but what</font>

939
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:43,900
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> max</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a Mac marketplace</font>

940
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:48,600
or house how is that specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform</font>

941
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:51,730
marketed and sold yeah so the Mac

942
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:55,259
marketplaces are actually a lot less

943
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:58,420
common than the windows marketplaces the

944
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:02,020
marketplace is like ecstatic that have

945
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:05,010
commoditized this this market are almost

946
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:09,070
solely based on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows machines</font>

947
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:11,410
there are smaller niche market places

948
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,640
for Linux machines and sometimes you

949
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:18,700
would find max but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty rare I</font>

950
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:26,770
would imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's it's potentially</font>

951
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:28,330
a demand perhaps an issue of demand but

952
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:33,930
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just what you see in the</font>

953
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,930
marketplace yeah

954
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,180
from the point of view of a hacker it

955
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,400
strike me that up time would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

956
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:48,058
important aspect of a machine especially

957
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:51,690
given you can have it or hide behind it

958
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:54,119
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on there I may not</font>

959
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">have seen it but I was wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that</font>

960
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:00,660
was a metric that was readily available

961
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:03,329
yep so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can take a look at</font>

962
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:06,750
it afterwards on my machine but on every

963
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:09,059
every listing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the marketplace has an</font>

964
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,470
indication of an uptime<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so you can</font>

965
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:16,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a clear understanding of how</font>

966
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:16,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">available this machine is yep</font>

967
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:31,179
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what we're seeing right now</font>

968
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,669
is first and foremost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strong</font>

969
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:35,469
transition into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the endpoint so</font>

970
00:51:33,669 --> 00:51:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">traditionally these marketplaces would</font>

971
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:40,329
focus on servers and in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

972
00:51:38,649 --> 00:51:43,118
of years you see an ever growing

973
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:45,429
percentage of endpoints these would

974
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,279
typically be windows machines but I

975
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:50,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the more that the reason by the</font>

976
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:53,109
way was that the traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> actors in</font>

977
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:55,209
these marketplaces were people that

978
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:57,669
would do server scanning IP scanning

979
00:51:55,209 --> 00:52:00,189
right they would find a server right and

980
00:51:57,669 --> 00:52:03,459
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know that brute</font>

981
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:06,129
force it and enlisted for sale and then

982
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:09,038
new players came into this market which

983
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,139
are the commodity malware players right

984
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,959
the ad where players the click fraud

985
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:15,969
players that and their assets are mostly

986
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:18,279
endpoints but they've seen that they can

987
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:19,659
transact on these endpoints and make you

988
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:21,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and monetize them significantly</font>

989
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:23,349
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than they do with regular click</font>

990
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:25,479
fraud and that's why you see an

991
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,639
increasing percentage of endpoints<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

992
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:29,468
think given this situation and the more

993
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:31,539
we see these types of commodity malware

994
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:34,349
going into mobile the more mobile

995
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:42,269
endpoints<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see in these platforms</font>

996
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:48,329
sure any other questions isn't it cool

997
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:48,328
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop again so thank you</font>

998
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,460
you
