1
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,079
sauce

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,050
computer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have to be accessing</font>

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,669
so from the outset we were dealing with

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,640
really a financial institutions computer

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,640
or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> government computer those were sort</font>

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,740
of there at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning as time went</font>

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,050
on and there was a minute where there

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,070
would be a protected computer protects a

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,470
computer yes turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> well decide interest</font>

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what you know since sort of you</font>

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,390
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> casio calculator of 1988 what</font>

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
is not a protector commuter these days

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,280
right just out of interest it's a fair

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,729
point which is that protected computer

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,229
isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very broad term so as</font>

16
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,870
I mentioned when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the statute was first</font>

17
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,010
passed it was focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on sort of</font>

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">government computers NASA security</font>

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,879
information it was intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect a</font>

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,290
federal interest so a federal interest

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,150
computer in fact was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term that was</font>

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,360
in the statute and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made sense in</font>

23
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:09,330
1984 or 1986 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one which time on you</font>

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,400
use by and large the government was one

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,280
of the principal victims of a computer

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,729
crime so the federal interest was

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,800
narrowly defined moving from nineteen

28
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,220
before we at eight percent of computers

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,229
in households to now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere</font>

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,440
bordering on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety percent essentially</font>

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,900
and a protected computer the class has

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,220
expanded and to your point yes

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,750
essentially by the definition

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,090
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that's connected to</font>

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet would constitute a</font>

36
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,340
protected computer under the statute

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,110
okay well<font color="#E5E5E5"> since that's super broad I</font>

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,860
hope the rest of the statutes not super

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,860
bored as well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will understand so</font>

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,750
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to obtain information</font>

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,750
from the computer that you have accessed

42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,960
what sorry I yea sorry what it was a

43
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,880
tiny information meeting thank you you

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,440
can hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> up cue cards right so opinion</font>

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,549
information does it mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you must</font>

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">download and copy and take away no</font>

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,690
merely viewing the information on the

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,100
screen would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be obtaining</font>

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,109
information if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the directory</font>

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,239
structure of a remote computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

51
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,160
under the CFA would be obtaining

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,520
information under the statute and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> come really to the nub of the issue</font>

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,270
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really where what is considered</font>

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,489
the malicious activity is kind of

56
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,230
defined and captured it is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

57
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was happen without authorization or</font>

58
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,690
while exceeding authorized access how do

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,570
we normally look at this term so for us

60
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the lion's share of our cases involve</font>

61
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,870
people with malicious intent what do I

62
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,000
mean by and<font color="#E5E5E5"> large most of our cases</font>

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,100
involve people who are breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,300
computers to monetize that information

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,049
and sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> either on the black market</font>

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,260
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extort people number sextortion</font>

67
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,940
cases people who clearly have malicious

68
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,250
intent and breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer or</font>

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,150
miltern if we have a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases and</font>

70
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,250
these are actually our favorites because

71
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,440
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the easiest there's the mad</font>

72
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,209
sysadmin who walks out the door and with

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,989
a firm middle figure tears down the

74
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">system right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your universe of</font>

75
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,310
suspects is fairly narrow in that case

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,310
and this happens with greater frequency

77
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,019
than you may imagine can we can we just

78
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,480
have a momentary pause and a hand for

79
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,370
Leonard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you created slides that include</font>

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,690
a guy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> devil's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horns and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no hoodies</font>

81
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> no bark lovers anywhere</font>

82
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,640
so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this term mean though</font>

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,160
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a lot of and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think most</font>

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,049
of the debate and most of the contrary

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the statute is around what does this</font>

86
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,620
term mean without the observation or

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,270
exceeding authorized access when you're

88
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,460
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like what your</font>

89
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,780
community builds with that is when is it

90
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,340
your interaction with a remote

91
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,170
conservative remote server is in fact

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,020
authorized now there is a definition

93
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,709
under the statute for what it means to

94
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,750
exceed authorized access but<font color="#E5E5E5"> many upon</font>

95
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,580
reading it still scratch their head and

96
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">say I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel like I have a better</font>

97
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,739
idea of what this actually means yeah

98
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,839
because here you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're defining</font>

99
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,390
exceeds all times access without a

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,280
definition of authorization so if

101
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,500
obtaining information is just seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,929
then what if a<font color="#CCCCCC"> website owner</font>

103
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,620
accidentally exposes information why am

104
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,150
I the one who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the liability as the</font>

105
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,100
person who goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sees</font>

106
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information you don't have a</font>

107
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,870
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of authorization that's a lot</font>

108
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,369
of breath okay so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

109
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,500
definition of authorization in the

110
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,730
statute that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true there's been case</font>

111
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,980
law that kind of has tried to address

112
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,780
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it greater form to a</font>

113
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,190
greater or less success the one thing I

114
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,400
would flag is this has been the subject

115
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,770
of some disagreement in the courts so

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,599
the federal judicial system is divided

117
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,280
in the circuits so you have your

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,460
eleventh circuit's and you've got the DC

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,650
Circuit a circuit is essentially a

120
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,030
cluster of courts you have your district

121
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,950
court your trial court where you go when

122
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,659
you still make your<font color="#E5E5E5"> case if you lose</font>

123
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,390
their you can appeal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the appellate</font>

124
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,820
court the appellate court<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

125
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,539
decides<font color="#CCCCCC"> to law for the entire circuit so</font>

126
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,820
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 is cross-country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

127
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,810
instance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what we call a circuit</font>

128
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,030
split that means is we have three

129
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,220
circuits that have adopted a narrow

130
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,840
interpretation of what exceeding

131
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,850
authorized access me and what these

132
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">courts have said is for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

133
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the nose okay scoops the nozzle</font>

134
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,380
case in the nozzle<font color="#E5E5E5"> case what you had was</font>

135
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,070
an employee

136
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,710
who leaves a company looking to start up

137
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,610
another company and make money he

138
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,750
convinces his friends were still at the

139
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:55,310
company to log into the network yet data

140

and send it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> him that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be used in</font>

agreement where the court said was you

151
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,969
cannot use authorized access like these

156
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,760
American at home here in Australia is

currently this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole search happens and</font>

158
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,230
this is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple why is okay</font>

159
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,700
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> civilization</font>

160
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,200
right Wow nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else you will yeah I</font>

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,490
was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

162
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick answer but I also think I'll get</font>

163
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,260
debated in the panel sorry that's good

164
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean this is this</font>

165
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,289
reminds me number of statutes that we

166
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,790
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to deal with for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

167
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,110
the IP statutes intellectual property

168
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,120
search you said that have a civil remedy

169
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,670
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a criminal remedy and when do</font>

170
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go which way a large question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

171
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,660
like what is the actual damage there's

172
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,640
actually a rubric of considerations that

173
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,710
we have when we decide whether to bring

174
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,780
a federal case and whether it represents

175
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,229
a substantial enough federal interests

176
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,750
by rules we are supposed to compare the

177
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,160
case to this rubric of considerations

178
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,920
and decide whether it warrants a

179
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,450
criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> prosecution in this case we</font>

180
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,140
apparently did and we decided there was

181
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,590
enough damage enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost that we would</font>

182
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,219
proceed with this as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal matter</font>

183
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,239
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the short answer to that sir</font>

184
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the courts the appellate court</font>

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,670
eventually came back and said that's not

186
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,560
okay you have turned what is a hacking

187
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,030
statute into a misappropriation statute

188
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,860
the factors information was taken and

189
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,960
used for another purpose wasn't a

190
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,270
hacking crime in and of itself you had

191
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,130
two other circuits the fourth in the

192
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,650
second who each a similar decision the

193
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,210
the Second Circuit cannibal cop case

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,120
where you have the police officer who

195
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">was trolling the police databases to</font>

196
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,050
find potential victims to kidnap and

197
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,849
assault the government's<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory there</font>

198
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,820
was when you were accessing that

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that consistent with your</font>

201
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,520

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA Second Circuit came back and</font>

204
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,830
said just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a manova case no that's</font>

205
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,520
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it works because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

206

individual had legitimate access to the

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,919
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you cannot turn that into</font>

208
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,720
unauthorized access because of a mere

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,020
violation of the way that that they

210
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,020
chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

211
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,090
hi in contrast to this you have three

212
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,660
circuits that with the other wave up but

213
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:58,470
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the agreement can actually</font>

214
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,240
determine whether authorization is

215
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,140
legitimate so if an employer says you

216
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,080
know you're allowed to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

217
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,910
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> X but not why I if you were on the</font>

218
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,710
computer you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it for X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

219
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,810
you use why that's enough to constitute

220
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA a violation kind of under the</font>

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your property Smith is more</font>

223
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,890
complicated there was a second nozzle

224
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,220
case so Nona knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> old who was acquitted</font>

225
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,560
because of the reversal on the first

226
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,910
time around the government re prosecuted

227

him under a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory under the</font>

228
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">CFAA as opposed to saying he exceeded</font>

229
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">authorized access the argument was he</font>

230
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,430
didn't have access to start off with

231
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and had his</font>

232
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,260
privileges revoked and therefore when he

233
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,270
used other people to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access that</font>

234
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,790
information he essentially was doing so

235
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,290
without authorization and indeed the

236
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:50,500
appellate court said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

237
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,480
that's no k theory under bcf ish so you

238
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,600
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of different theories</font>

239
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,950
under which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA is proceeding in the</font>

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,950
criminal and in the civil lane

241
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:07,950
for you hahahaha my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

242
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,320
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that the lack of</font>

243
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,650
clarity around what authorization means

244
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,500
has resulted in circuit splits and has

245
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,880
made things somewhat more contentious

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,950
and difficult i wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font>

247
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the additional challenges that come out</font>

248
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,580
as additional criticisms so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is</font>

249
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the kinds of things that most</font>

250
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,690
people would think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't be</font>

251
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,319
federal crimes could arguably get swept

252
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,890
up in this so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you're on</font>

253
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,250
match and matches rules say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

254
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:43,470
expected to represent yourself as you

255
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:48,870
are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my profile says that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

256
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">tall built and stunning that is very</font>

257
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:55,950
sweet of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah you're undermining</font>

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,310
the point that I'm lying thank you girl

259
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,830
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so should that be a federal</font>

260
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,170
crime should I in fact and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

261
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,090
prison where I can use my match profile

262
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:10,650
to attract an entirely different type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

263
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,680
person or should it not another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

264
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be that I sit at work all day</font>

265
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,359
checking my baseball scores which

266
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:22,590
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do all the time love baseball</font>

267
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Madrid again like am I am I exceeding</font>

268
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,830
authorized access or accessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

269
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">authorization because work says hey</font>

270
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,010
guess what guys when you're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> work you</font>

271
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,170
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> working and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want you</font>

272
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use work computers for work and</font>

273
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,150
checking your baseball scores isn't

274
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,449
really work should that be a federal

275
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,160
crime should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to prison probably not</font>

276
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,520
so this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlights without that</font>

277
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,579
the gray area in exceeds authorization

278
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,990
or in sorry in defining authorization

279
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,170
can be pretty far-reaching can have some

280
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,630
fairly foolish<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leonard is dying here</font>

281
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,569
limit have there ever been any

282
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,840
prosecutions based on this of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

283
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,070
so the answer that is with one

284
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,500
qualification because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe to talk</font>

285
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,330
about the glory true case<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna get</font>

286
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the true we say as an</font>

287
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,380
exception to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this no</font>

288
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,449
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the type of case that we</font>

289
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,330
spend federal resources on in fact in

290
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nosal case the first nozzle case the</font>

291
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">dissent that is the one judge who</font>

292
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,880
disagree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opinion that was I</font>

293
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,830
appointed down basically said we're

294
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,089
creating strong men here as a way of

295
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that the statute would not be</font>

296
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:26,089
used this way and we would agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

297
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,910
that because this is not a case that we

298
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,010
would prosecute which sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

299
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,719
and reasonable and we do like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

300
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,390
that DOJ is not wasting taxpayers

301
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,540
dollars on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing however</font>

302
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,740
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have security</font>

303
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,140
researchers and they look for bugs and

304
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,560
oftentimes the work that they do falls

305
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,449
into this morass of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray area whereas</font>

306
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,069
unclear if they are accessing without

307
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,950
authorization or exceeding authorized

308
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,100
access and for researchers it's really

309
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,230
hard to know what the line is and I have

310
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,880
this sort of like weirdly naive<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

311
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">fashioned of you that I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm</font>

312
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,270
covered by a lower I should be able to

313
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,279
understand what the law means and like

314
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,350
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to toe the line I may not like</font>

315
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,300
the line I may feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the line is in</font>

316
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,800
the wrong place but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be really</font>

317
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,420
good if there was a clear line and like

318
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm on the side of the line</font>

319
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,410
that's not gonna put me in an orange

320
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,420
jumpsuit so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big problem for</font>

321
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,550
me is this piece like this is the piece

322
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,640
that gets me fired up about the CFA is

323
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,560
that I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> researches for those</font>

324
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,650
who can't see my t-shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackers</font>

325
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,270
manifesto feel like researchers may be

326
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,910
considered criminals but mostly that

327
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,439
crime is curiosity and we need them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

328
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,810
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in need to</font>

329
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,220
do research do<font color="#CCCCCC"> security research a whole</font>

330
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:45,650
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people thank you by the way we</font>

331
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,570
really appreciate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work you do i as a</font>

332
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,089
consumer of technology appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,670
work that you do and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

334
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,750
problem that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear so recently</font>

335
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,329
when lemon they were going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

336
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,700
slides I said to him is<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

337
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,540

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cfa and he said in my lower leeway</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

340
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:09,110
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it this is the problem of</font>

341
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:11,329
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we deal with this every</font>

342
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,009
day for example I part of my job is

343
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,479
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with investigators who want to</font>

344
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,239
do an interesting investigative things

345
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,429
and in almost each of those cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

346
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:21,079
question is hey can I actually go in

347
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:23,480
search this computer using this tool and

348
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,069
the question is the answer is it depends

349
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,290
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to do it where's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

350
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer located what exactly are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

351
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,379
searching on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the computer there are a</font>

352
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,059
lot of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are pivot points</font>

353
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:33,739
that would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legality of these</font>

354
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,118
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this isn't I think about just</font>

355
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:38,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">the statute those or surveillance laws</font>

356
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:39,709
it's about technology it's it's not a

357
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,170
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer so with the port scanning</font>

358
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:44,420
for example on by and large if you are

359
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,059
simply running a normal port<font color="#CCCCCC"> scanner is</font>

360
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,349
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> measured protocols what software</font>

361
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,199
numbers things of that sort from a

362
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,420
remote computer that would not be a CFA

363
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,699
a violation however what's a harder

364
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,589
question is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you were</font>

365
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with a hard bleep next point and</font>

366
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,529
what you decided to do was to craft

367
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,600
packets to see what you were going to

368
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:04,009
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back from a server and</font>

369
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,660
whether you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get kicked back</font>

370
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,569
the data that's not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back</font>

371
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:12,730
in the heartbleed exchange that comes

372
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,139
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to life and so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why it</font>

373
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,819
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

374
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,160
understand this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is difficult for people</font>

375
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,748
working technology but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would submit</font>

376
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a problem that is inherent in</font>

377
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:25,309
technology perhaps not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the statute</font>

378
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,889
film I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you opened the</font>

379
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:28,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">door for the hard way to example yes so</font>

380
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,179
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

381
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:33,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when hardly came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

382
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:36,079
were told hey and when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

383
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,119
people I mean every internet user was

384
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,349
told hey go change your password for any

385
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:42,049
site you actually care about the

386
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,629
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the problem was that if</font>

387
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:46,129
the site itself had not taken the

388
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:47,929
necessary steps to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself from</font>

389
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:49,699
heartbleed all you would be doing is

390
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:52,639
throwing new passwords into the void not

391
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:55,099
helpful so lots of nice people will call

392
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,869
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> security researchers said hey well</font>

393
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,669
we've created this little free tool for

394
00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:01,220
you and this enables you to test whether

395
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:03,319
the site is still vulnerable to heart

396
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,600
bleed or not

397
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,950
for those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the words test</font>

398
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,340
whether the site is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still vulnerable to</font>

399
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,890
heartbleed equals exploit our meat so

400
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,610
all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are let's say my</font>

401
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,050
mum were happily exploiting websites

402
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,430
without knowing it right they didn't

403
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it in those terms but</font>

404
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is what they had to do to figure</font>

405
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,320
out whether the site was still

406
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,390
vulnerable in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to then change their</font>

407
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,270
password and protect themselves now

408
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:32,020
granted the FBI did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not come crashing</font>

409
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,310
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mum's living room she's all good</font>

410
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,500
nonetheless<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point remains that if</font>

411
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,780
you have a situation where the way that

412
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,610
the law is written basically means that

413
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,500
that action which is so sort of like

414
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,200
innocent and well-meaning and is

415
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,290
designed to promote better<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

416
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,760
which should be what this is all about

417
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:53,510
that kind of suggests that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> law might</font>

418
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,439
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lilit so on to my</font>

419
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,120
next points this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my biggie so</font>

420
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,280
authorization and the lack of definition

421
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,130
is a really big problem the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

422
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,220
though is massively exacerbated by

423
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,430
section G of 1030 1030 is a CFA so

424
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,949
section G<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically says yeah basically</font>

425
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:19,490
if you violate any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also cause</font>

426
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,500
for civil action and that's a huge

427
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem because again how many people in</font>

428
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,010
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> do research hands up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many</font>

429
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have received legal threats how</font>

430
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,320
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have received criminal legal</font>

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,389
threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's what I thought how</font>

432
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,639
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you received civil legal threats</font>

433
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,010
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much everybody who gets a</font>

434
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,690
threat it comes because of section G

435
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,010
which is civil action and that's what

436
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,430
creates<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big chilling effects right</font>

437
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:49,400
is people are worried the companies who

438
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,670
are naturally protective of their

439
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,860
reputation will use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFA as a big</font>

440
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,960
stick to fight off researchers and I

441
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,899
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much every researcher that I know</font>

of our rapid seven has had a threat some

443
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,750
point and it's always come from civil

444
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,870
cases there's very few there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

445
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,730
couple of had criminal threats

446
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,870
and this is this is a big problem this

447
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we all tell each other about</font>

448
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,649
this is what stops people talking at

449
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,420
conferences this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what creates the big</font>

450
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,610
chilling effect and not money two

451
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,330
different talks but tomorrow we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad we have a bad sore model and</font>

464
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,660
so in terms of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

465

way of us creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graph to show you</font>

466
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:16,120
something in terms of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources we</font>

467
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,520
surveyed the internet which I have been

468
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,949
mocked for many times so how about it

469
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,470
we've also done stuff like we pulled the

<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit community all that kind of</font>

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,580
stuff we consistently hear from people

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,960
this response every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time i've done a cfa</font>

to which is now a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> times i</font>

always ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a show of hands and it's</font>

very few factors also to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> also toss</font>

481
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,320
also wouldn't report cases in wrestle on

so it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really watch my the upper</font>

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,210
right thumb but i'll have a set of

484
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,710
numbers in a moment that may actually go

485
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,390
to this can you very quickly explain

486
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,730
what West<font color="#CCCCCC"> laura's but one sorry westlaw</font>

487
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:04,570
is basically a it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system</font>

488
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,070
whereby cases are reported their their

489
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,689
helmet database so that lawyers like me

490
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,429
can go and research and see what the

491
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,380
case law is on any particular issue

492
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,740
decipherment briefs and for our legal

493
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,370
research not every case is the subject

494
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:20,890
of a report in westlaw so yes there

495
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,120
there there is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did believe going</font>

496
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,230
through the data and you could at least

497
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,229
capture from trends

498
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,170
absolutely who decides with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

499
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:37,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">sighs what can I see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of judges</font>

500
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:39,730
doesn't yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for me I I would</font>

501
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,120
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the core language addressed</font>

502
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:46,270
but failing that and there is a real

503
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,129
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> on getting alignment on on</font>

504
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,020
getting language for authorization means

505
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,940
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> failing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I would like to see</font>

506
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,440
section G removed now the good thing is

507
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,460
that when we have the panel there's

508
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be some debate over that</font>

509
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,770
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there are very</font>

510
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,879
legitimate reasons for section G and

511
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,990
fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kristen from Microsoft is</font>

512
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,810
going to help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what some of</font>

513
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,120
those are but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be my personal</font>

514
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,909
thing if I was king for a day no why do

515
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,729
I always do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'ma girl I was queen</font>

516
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,160
for a day I would take out for the

517
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:20,080
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so a couple of other</font>

518
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:22,300
criticisms of cfa these are not

519
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">researcher specific but these are the</font>

520
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">two biggies that we've not covered so</font>

521
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,200
far so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is that it is</font>

522
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:32,200
aggressively used for cases that

523
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,180
probably shouldn't be cfa violations and

524
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,070
the other is harsh penalties so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lori</font>

525
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,020
drew is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very famous example the</font>

526
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,960
people use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graphic aggressive you</font>

527
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,540
so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly Larry Drew was a woman</font>

528
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,700
whose daughter was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullied and she</font>

529
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,860
was incensed about this and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she went</font>

530
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,980
on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> MySpace and she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created an account</font>

531
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:55,060
posing as a teenage boy and she flirted

532
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,160
with her daughter's bully and eventually

533
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,600
after she'd got sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of into a quasi</font>

534
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,550
relationship with her daughter's bully

535
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,060
she kind of ended the relationship and

536
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">then started bullying the bully and</font>

537
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,649
unfortunately the girl took it very hard

538
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,810
and she killed herself so when this

539
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,220
happened understandably there was a sort

540
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,050
of outcry people felt that this was a

541
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,140
huge tragedy and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> something needed</font>

542
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,919
to be done and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there was no</font>

543
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:24,130
real other way to go at Lori drew they

544
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,380
used the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA and they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> myspace's</font>

545
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,180
Terms of Service say that you cannot

546
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,910
miss tourism misrepresent who you are

547
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,680
which again

548
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that match com example not</font>

549
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,660
super did not super<font color="#CCCCCC"> too similar so she</font>

550
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,790
was prosecuted on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA for this and</font>

551
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,120
and she was convicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it was</font>

552
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,830
overturned and appeals that's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

553
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,469
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is used as in a very famous</font>

554
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:49,590
example of the overreach the over

555
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:55,560
aggressive use of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA in terms of</font>

556
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:57,209
harsh penalties there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot of</font>

557
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,679
criticism and I think we'll go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

558
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,020
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the panel and then we'll</font>

559
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:06,050
also speak to in his next section but

560
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:09,540
there's a lot of criticism that the

561
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:12,750
penalties are a high and that a lot of

562
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">people's efforts to reform actually look</font>

563
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,780
at increasing penalties minimizing the

564
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:21,420
number of misdemeanors making things

565
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,340
much more into felonies that kind of

566
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,140
thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a huge challenge because</font>

567
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,830
most people I know who work in

568
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,270
cybersecurity started out cutting their

569
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,480
teeth by doing some things that were a

570
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,990
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> questionable legally and that's</font>

571
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you learn and that curiosity is</font>

572
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,550
actually a pretty healthy part of our

573
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,650
our community so if you have a situation

574
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,200
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're likely to face serious</font>

575
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,340
prison time for that then that<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes a</font>

576
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,780
real problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our community which</font>

577
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,600
considering we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have a skill</font>

578
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,660
shortage kids could exacerbate that

579
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,980
problem quite look back to you my bro

580
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,570
thank you

581
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,460
so I just want to rush through some

582
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,460
information about a Coliseum a is in

583
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,750
fact being used ideally if you a little

584
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,929
bit of comfort about the way in which we

585
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,520
actually administer the the statute what

586
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:11,210
the gun Florida I would say is Lori drew

587
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:15,210
that was a case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was tried in 2008</font>

588
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,650
upon appeal upon have against reverse we

589
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,140
did not appeal that and there has not

590
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,799
been a case since then which refuse that

591
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,600
theory so how the department justice

592
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,910
approached the CFAA<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I would flag</font>

593
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:33,629
is every year we have about 55,000

594
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:35,250
federal cases that are file dad involved

595
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've imagined</font>

now in that massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty-five thousand</font>

599
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:51,230
or so you've got 153 computer fraud

600
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,230
cases yes sir

601
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:59,629
on that ingredients<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

there is not there

603
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,440
yes service mirrors and felonies they'll

604
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,570
be like the next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> one after that so</font>

605
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,790
yeah it's okay um so 153 cases the line

606
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:16,260
share our what I think we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

607
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:19,050
agree are bad guys none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you one thing</font>

608
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,270
we did we as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned we administer</font>

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:24,090
the network of prosecutors across the

different us rates who bring these cases

612
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,630
and we did aticle we said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

618
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,689
and the answer was<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years was less</font>

619
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">than five all cases that were in the</font>

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:10,020

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,550
very very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unusual for a</font>

630
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:21,019

take off

651
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,440
no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it for sentencing purposes</font>

the five thousand dollars fairly quickly

658
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:44,429
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> concede that that that is one of</font>

in about forty nine percent of the cases

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,580
and both your fraud and abuse cases and

696
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,460
federal offenses they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> send us a</font>

judges are typically sentencing below

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:40,660
the guidelines why do people want to

increase penalties fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> question um so I</font>

708
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,010
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that generally Congress does</font>

709
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,120
view this issue of the lack of sense

710
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,309
things is some indication of the

711
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,580
importance and concern about the crime

712
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:53,470
so yes there has been a drive to

713
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,320
increase certain sentences so for

714

example where we didn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

715
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,460
was sufficient punishment potentially

716
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,809
for a critical infrastructure system we

717
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,010
might say hey we think there should be

718
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:05,230

there that might result in large of

722
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,260
casualties again I think sensing is one

723
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,360
of the harder thing because there's a

724
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,190
line drawn functioning people disagree

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the difference is in general</font>

731
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,540
you have about ninety three percent plea

732
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,370
rate I guess I would disagree that

733
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,500
that's because of draconian sentencing I

734
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,060
would say that usually that's because we

735
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,810
tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring a federal case when we</font>

736
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:45,060
have very very very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence you</font>

737
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,280
know and so the benefits of going to

738
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,760
trial versus pleading bit of militating

739
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:54,330
favor of pleading in those instances I'm

740
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,560
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's reverse oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright so</font>

741
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,280
we're going to talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

reform suggestions that have been made

<font color="#E5E5E5">people have heard of Aaron's law</font>

746
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,740
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of you so I'm going to be</font>

747
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,090
super briefed on this so I'm not going

748
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about where our and slaw came</font>

749
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,590
from because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys presumably</font>

750
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:20,129
familiar with that story and basically

751
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it looks to do is three main things</font>

752
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:26,660
one it would make commercial terms of

753
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:30,240
service no longer a violation of the cfa

754
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:36,800
to it would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and create a little bit</font>

755
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:39,360
more crispness over what authorization

756
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,710
means in other words you would have to

757
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,699
circumvent a technological protection

758
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:48,540
which is very like the DMCA and then the

759
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,220
third is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that you can't</font>

760
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,520
be done for the multiple council the

761
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,950
same thing and one go and it would

762
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,210
increase the it would sorry change the

763
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,260
way that the value of information is

764
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,540
being figured out the reality is on this

765
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:07,350
Aaron's<font color="#CCCCCC"> laura's normally pass I did get</font>

766
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:10,020
reintroduced but it is incredibly

767
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,340
contentious for a number of reasons

768
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:17,460
partly because of what's in it but

769
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly because of political attachments</font>

770
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,560
and associations with Aaron and SOPA

771
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,629
PIPA so Aaron's not Aaron's law is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

772
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,620
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

773
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:27,759
and this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the panel like</font>

775
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,539
they'd probably will address these yes

776
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:34,209
or whether parents lot actually makes

777

fact that we at the same time we're

requesting other authority to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

authority we wanted drew some fire from

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,779
from folks in the community saying we

804
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:39,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are too expansive and</font>

capture of conduct that that would

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,090
implicate for example computer security

807
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,590
researchers be glad to say that when the

administration came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> was proposal</font>

809
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,879
they heard from me a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot interestingly</font>

00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:53,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was not our intent and we could</font>

explain why teach these visions were

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would still allow us to go after</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we were attempting to go after</font>

while minimizing likelihood that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

817
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,609
wouldn't implicate computer security

826
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,569
were on a call there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

827
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,129
people giving feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was the only</font>

828
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:32,310
non lawyer on the call so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was very</font>

829
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:35,969
quiet very intimidated

830
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,230
and he the folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the White House said</font>

831
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:39,330
genuine something what do you think and

832
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,429
I went well you've made<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

833
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,500
illegal and there was this silence and

834
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,589
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just went oh it was</font>

835
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,139
awesome yeah we didn't mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font>

836
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:52,140
we'll have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again record we</font>

837
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually think we did it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but are</font>

838
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,390
you totally did so the good thing is

839
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,970
though that through this whole process

840
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,470
we went backwards and forwards and they

841
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,930
were really really receptive to feedback

842
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,640
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never gave up even though this</font>

843
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,160
was not going to be a version that went

844
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,299
to Congress they continue to listen to

845
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,600
the feedback they continue to make

846
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">adjustments and that meant that when</font>

847
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,190
this came out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

848
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,920
feedback that we had provided was

849
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:24,540
reflected in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so basically senators</font>

850
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,730
Graham and White House created a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drug</font>

851
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,200
proposal based largely on what the

852
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,120
administration and come up with but also

853
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,189
had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things it was</font>

854
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">initially called the international cyber</font>

855
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,190
crime prevention act then they shortened

856
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,250
it down to being a member to see Sir

857
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,020
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get accepted as an amendment</font>

858
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:43,500
then they reintroduced it this year and

859
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,480
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like prevention a</font>

860
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,590
botnet spotter<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prevention Act um and</font>

861
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,970
they're still working on it so there's

862
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,430
likely to be another version introduced

863
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:55,259
that has some other stuff in there and

864
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:56,819
basically it addresses the terms of

865
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,400
service issue so it basically says

866
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,330
commercial terms of service is not it's

867
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,360
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a violation it adds in some stuff to</font>

868
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:09,360
address botnets as you would assume from

869
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> title so what they're trying to get</font>

870
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">out is if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are someone who didn't</font>

871
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,180
create the bot map but you're selling

872
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,190
access to it today the law can't really

873
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,980
cope with that so that's why they've

874
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,840
added this sort of means of access again

875
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,910
we had to do some back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

876
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,460
whether that captured things like

877
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,529
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> or metasploit so the language</font>

878
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,750
got adjusted and again the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

879
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,820
say that's good about this is in the

880
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:36,030
past years since they came out with the

881
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,650
original I CPA the staffers have been

882
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,510
really really receptive to talking about

883
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and making changes</font>

884
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,970
so we eventually got to a point where

885
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,310
all the big criticisms that we had from

886
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,140
a research point of view they had

887
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,029
actually addressed and the version that

888
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,680
came out as a see Sir amendment at the

889
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of last year which as I said did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

890
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,710
move forward Cesar actually was pretty

891
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,000
much i would say neutral for researchers

892
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,130
it definitely did not make the situation

893
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,740
worse for researchers there are other

894
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,970
things in it that people may not like

895
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,310
that we may get to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel</font>

896
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,109
depending how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time we have but i</font>

897
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,400
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep an eye on this one again this</font>

898
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,690
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean for those</font>

899
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">who don't know there's kind of some</font>

900
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,980
stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in politics at the moment</font>

901
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's really unlikely that anything</font>

902
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,050
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move anytime soon but I</font>

903
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:25,470
think it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that next year we</font>

904
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,510
will see senators<font color="#CCCCCC"> Graham</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on white house</font>

905
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,669
and possibly one or two others pick up

906
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,980
an updated version of this bill and

907
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,860
reintroduce it so next year we're likely

908
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,890
to see another<font color="#CCCCCC"> CF a reform efforts so</font>

909
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,170
that brings us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the panel discussion</font>

910
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:49,080
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask my panelists to come</font>

911
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:51,090
up now why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep my really</font>

915
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,550
should read too much into who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

isn't wearing the I'm a criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot oh</font>

00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,720
knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they were in for coming to do</font>

935
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,350
this they both you that they were likely

936
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,790
to have us kind of villainize them a

937
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,270
little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still agree to come</font>

938
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,270
and they're being

939
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:21,150
we're not done yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so did everyone</font>

940
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,589
everyone all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

941
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,540
to keep the super simple we've really

942
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:27,900
got to questions that we're going to ask

943
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:31,500
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is if you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a quick</font>

944
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,599
round of what do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cfa how</font>

945
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,950
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel about it as it is today and</font>

946
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,329
then we're going to ask people like what

947
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,009
they think should happen with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

948
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:38,910
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're going to get</font>

949
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit more into the debate</font>

950
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,379
session and and then if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

951
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,599
ensure people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would stop checking my</font>

952
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing on it will open it up to</font>

953
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,990
questions from the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

954
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,680
running straight into my stuff people

956
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,299
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to get the hell out of here</font>

957
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,609
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,330
do you want to just go first<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you</font>

959
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:05,440
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the survey</font>

00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:10,130
thank you go first oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll go first</font>

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,750
can't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into practice and</font>

a question that we had earlier the the

00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:08,410
and as

1004
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:10,629
as Leonard said right will they go to

1005
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:15,069
jail it depends and that answer is

1006
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:16,240
unacceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's I'm not saying</font>

1007
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that Leonard's answer is</font>

1008
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,379
unacceptable this is right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I it</font>

1009
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:26,049
does depend and it shouldn't so

1010
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,090
Microsoft is use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA in several</font>

1011
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,880
civil actions it's not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1012
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,740
use often but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a part of our</font>

1013
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
Digital Crimes Unit strategy so that

1014
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:38,140
when we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of our botnet</font>

1015
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,320
takedowns and malware eradication cases

1016
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,180
it's it's a useful tool and when you

1017
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at our complaints that we file our</font>

1018
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,310
civil complaints it's usually one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

1019
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,520
or seven causes of action that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1020
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:54,520
bring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a civil case typically we're</font>

1021
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,320
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going for the billions of dollars</font>

1022
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,840
types of remedies we're looking for

1023
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,080
civil injunctions you know whoever is

1024
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:06,550
the the bot herder<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Citadel botnet</font>

1025
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,650
the botnet Creator had a CRM associated

1026
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,109
with it and was<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on providing a</font>

1027
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,920
really bespoke customized botnet

1028
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:17,560
solution for his customers and so we

1029
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:19,570
used the<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe AAA as a tool to help</font>

1030
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring a case against that individual to</font>

1031
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,970
stop him you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of thing</font>

1032
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,890
where you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a civil tool</font>

1033
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,330
should that be the the realm of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the atom</font>

1034
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,520
police officers and

1035
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,290
and Leonard space in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DOJ quite</font>

1036
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,150
possibly but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were seeing such an</font>

1037
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,220
impact against millions of our customers

1038
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:37,990
it was a tool that we could use to help

1039
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,569
protect them and it's been an important

1040
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:44,680
tool for us why why is it that is going

1041
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use than career why better tool and</font>

1042
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,100
go on criminal so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one can</font>

1043
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:54,430
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this is Michael excellent</font>

1044
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:58,299
yes yeah now sort of so hello is it me

1045
00:43:54,430 --> 00:44:00,609
looking for so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a why</font>

1046
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,920
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> go criminal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's a matter of</font>

1047
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,710
philosophy you know we're not looking

1048
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,350
necessarily to bring a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal case</font>

1049
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,900
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to find the best remedy to</font>

1050
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:13,690
help protect our customers so if it's to

1051
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,240
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the botnet taken down we'll we'll</font>

1052
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:19,810
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA as a tool it's actually</font>

1053
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,410
surprising how few companies use that or

1054
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:26,259
use Lanham Act Kate claims or other

1055
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:29,020
other IP related claims to try to do

1056
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,240
this but it's a it's a legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

1057
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:33,750
community policing when the police

1058
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,750
aren't there

1059
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,550
so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jen said earlier she surveyed</font>

1060
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,830
the entire internet found that through

1061
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia survey found that sixty-five</font>

1062
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:48,590
percent of the researchers had had some

1063
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,680
kind of run in Nate's practice is almost

1064
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:57,020
entirely consumed by runs with see a CFA

1065
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:59,540
that are almost entirely civil and and

1066
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,100
that's you know like if I had my

1067
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:07,220
druthers as well yeah sure let's knock

1068
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:11,839
out you know the Civil component of cfa

1069
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:14,359
but clearly you're using it right so

1070
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,910
times when it's used for good sure but

1071
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:21,830
yeah when I asked around every

1072
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit contributor just a few months</font>

1073
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago I said hey have you guys ever had a</font>

1074
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,580
threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the CFAA and if so would you</font>

1075
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to talk about it it was about four</font>

1076
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,670
hundred we have about 400 historical

1077
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,770
contributors over the whole life of

1078
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">metasploit there's a couple in this room</font>

1079
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:42,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I got a lot of responses so I got no</font>

1080
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:45,470
responses back of I've ever had a CFA

1081
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:48,080
threat like I got none of those i had

1082
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:51,649
about of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 400</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i had about 40</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or so</font>

1083
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,549
that said I've had I'm worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1084
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,310
and please let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me know what you're going</font>

1085
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing with this and I and I know a</font>

1086
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:59,779
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a couple knew a guy who knew</font>

1087
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,460
a guy there were

1088
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,930
that were outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US that had</font>

1089
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:10,640
their own run-ins in Australia and

1090
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:13,700
mm-hmm yes so so there ya so there was

1091
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but it wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cfa specific but the</font>

1092
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,730
fact that the respondents all like felt

1093
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:23,120
like like like it's kind of textbook

1094
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:24,470
chillin right like because they're so

1095
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,980
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like that's kind of</font>

1096
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,810
like half of I wouldn't say half but it

1097
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,520
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's some large percentage of</font>

1098
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,020
the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I kind of picked up</font>

1099
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,790
this vulnerability disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> mantle at</font>

1100
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,210
rapid7 so we could help the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

1101
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:40,340
contributors like do disclosure publish

1102
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,350
exploits that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove ulnar abilities and</font>

1103
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,240
do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because we I have you know</font>

1104
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,790
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> luck of having like awesome</font>

1105
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,189
Boston lawyers awesome eff lawyers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1106
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,350
side that regular researchers you know

1107
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,030
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe even hobbyists this is not</font>

1108
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real job maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their pen testers</font>

1109
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,810
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just software developers</font>

1110
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,480
but they feel very uncomfortable doing

1111
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,370
on their on their own I think things are

1112
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,720
changing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the advent of bug</font>

1113
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,630
bounties and how that's all getting

1114
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,060
normalizer has been normalized and you

1115
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,340
have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Pentagon saying</font>

1116
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,210
like hey it's it you know recognizing at

1117
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:17,300
least that some things are ok to test

1118
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,800
but I mean fundamentally the the

1119
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:22,160
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of like how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1120
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,380
feel about the cfa<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm with nate there</font>

1121
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,620
are reasons to prosecute people

1122
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,790
criminally and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1123
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:34,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the cfa as a tool in their civil</font>

1124
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:38,990
breakfast but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have issues like</font>

1125
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:40,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the recent early morning</font>

1126
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,830
you know it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time machine</font>

1127
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:46,670
right so like in May Justin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schaeffer</font>

1128
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:48,590
who found that there was an ftp server

1129
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:51,800
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded credentials that had</font>

1130
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:55,369
health data listed on it this was in

1131
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Houston Texas he hauled Texas and he got</font>

1132
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:00,860
waited you know at gunpoint by FBI guys

1133
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,960
you know it right out of you know

1134
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,610
hackers movie and they felt like like I

1135
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,990
woke<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that woman again it felt like it</font>

1136
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:11,180
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 1988 all over again and so yeah</font>

1137
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,189
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there aren't a lot of criminal</font>

1138
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:16,279
prosecutions but when there are ones

1139
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:17,810
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one real recent that it really</font>

1140
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,100
hurts it really hurts and I know you're

1141
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:23,390
a nice guy so I wouldn't everyone else

1142
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,940
because I've talked a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> already but</font>

1143
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,670
let me point say a few things the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1144
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,100
one being when the shell on his face<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Barbizon success as policy makers is</font>

1146
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,650
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> luxury of simply</font>

1147
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,750
saying too hard right we have a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1148
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that is to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to deter</font>

1149
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,520
people who are clearly using this in

1150
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:46,009
criminal ways to take information nation

1151
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,080
to invade people's privacy do to do

1152

damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to computers and we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1153
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,480
sure we preserve our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

1154
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,319
while this thing to concerns from a

1155
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">community that we think is very</font>

1156
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,380
important and figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how</font>

1157
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,200
we navigate that this distinction is

1158
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,640
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple because while addressing</font>

1159
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,379
the concerns here we're to make sure

1160
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,118
that again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't open some huge gap</font>

1161
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,680
in the statute that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it harder for</font>

1162
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,260
us to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who I think we</font>

1163
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,299
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> all agree we should be going after</font>

1164
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:17,300
I think one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes this</font>

1165
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:20,119
difficult going forward is essentially

1166
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:25,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a terrific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well-crafted statute</font>

1167
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:28,190
said no one ever I mean simply put for

together statutes from overeating or

1170
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,970
being over brought at times there's a

1171
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,940
view that prosecutor discretion would

1172
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:40,730
take care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recent years in</font>

1173
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,880
recent years I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a concept</font>

1174
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,440
that is no not accepted as well it's

1175
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,630
it's something that people are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1176
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,859
comfortable with so the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

1177
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,869
statutes are very narrowly

1178
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:53,269
that only capture criminal conduct and

1179
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:55,759
nothing else and to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font>

1180
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:58,038
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult that can be I think</font>

1181
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:59,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">this would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the logical parallel</font>

1182
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:01,700
understand it's different but I think

1183
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an analog here to saying you</font>

1184
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,890
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> open with with cyber security is</font>

1185
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,759
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> code so you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just write</font>

1186
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:13,009
perfect programs because there's always

1187
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:14,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">some use of a program that you did not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anticipate something that the sudden</font>

1189
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:19,009
will do that's on the fringes and that

1190
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:21,380
by and large is what the statutes are

1191
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:24,259
doing they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy an art to go</font>

1192
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,900
after criminal conduct there are fringe

1193
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:29,960
cases in which there may be issues I

1194
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:33,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">think many businesses are kind of fringe</font>

1195
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,910
but still concerns because what you're

1196
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,400
doing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important so I'll figure</font>

1197
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,348
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to address these concerns while</font>

leaving what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do intact i</font>

1199
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,009
think is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our our big challenges</font>

1200
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:45,410
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to address something</font>

1206

otherwise or you know if you're black

panel

necessary component of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminal</font>

here to the Dutch government the Dutch

government released earlier this year a

binding set of prosecutorial guidelines

in Computer Crimes specifically the

binding guidelines that prosecutors must

was really hurt by it and the hacker who

who did the technical violation of the

even if they might have satisfied mens

do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this issue and to set a new</font>

1283
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:17,119
global standard you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when we had the</font>

1284
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,829
Budapest convention come out and

1285
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,780
everybody went forth and created cyber

1286
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:23,540
crime laws in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their countries you know</font>

1287
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:26,000
that was what 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago 15 years ago</font>

1288
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">its bits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Internet has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed so</font>

1289
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,900
dramatically and how we think about

1290
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,880
crime and<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminality has changed to the</font>

1291
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,220
point where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really incumbent upon</font>

1292
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:37,220
us to to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community together</font>

1293
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,828
again and provide our<font color="#E5E5E5"> own draft law what</font>

1294
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,078
is a crime what is the exceeding of

1295
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:43,970
authorization what are the boundaries

1296
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,619
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trespass perspective and what are</font>

1297
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,790
the rights of researchers there's a

1298
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,890
place for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1299
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,420
conversation it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been convened</font>

1300
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:53,180
because we keep getting shoehorn back

1301
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:56,260
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA space when that may not be</font>

1302
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right starting point at all</font>

1303
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:04,100
so I'm I'm what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have five people</font>

1304
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,530
up here I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> math I'm I'm one of two</font>

1305
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,819
non-lawyers sitting at this table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1306
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that there's like also like this</font>

1307
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,830
massive cultural disconnect between

1308
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:15,920
attorneys and coders right and so when

1309
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:19,069
when coders and hackers see laws like

1310
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA it screams ambiguity and when</font>

1311
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,580
security researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hackers in</font>

1312
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,529
particular see something that's

1313
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:27,920
ambiguous that is oh that that's

1314
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:30,770
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit right and and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1315
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,370
and and I think I think it could go a

1316
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:36,440
long way if you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at</font>

1317
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:39,620
like where do we see the CFA going in

1318
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,060
the future of really nailing down this

1319
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:44,000
whole notion of prosecutorial discretion

1320
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:46,820
of having the you know this the stopgap

1321
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mates talking about having real</font>

1322
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:52,730
like serious guidelines on prosecutions

1323
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:54,740
because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as long as you have</font>

1324
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:58,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like or anything else kind of</font>

1325
00:55:54,740 --> 00:56:01,700
clause in<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFAA I mean it's gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

1326
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to chill researchers who would</font>

1327
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,560
otherwise be doing good right of

1328
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:08,690
exposing vulnerabilities and you know

1329
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,700
letting consumers decide things and

1330
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,860
finding flaws before bad guys do or

1331
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:16,160
possibly concurrently or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> after bad</font>

1332
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:17,840
guys do haven't said anything and so

1333
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,440
yeah I think there's I think there's a

1334
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:24,410
that cultural disconnect is it can feeds

1335
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,880
a lot of the angst into<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA I mean</font>

1336
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,740
beyond what's actually written in the

1337
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:33,320
law so let me just respond to one thing

1338
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:35,509
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me say that we actually do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have us</font>

1339
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,800
procedural guidelines on bringing cfa

1340
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,130
prosecutions that have been in effect

1341
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,200
the last year and there's a required

1342
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,230
consultation requirement with us at main

1343
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:48,620
justice for any cfa prosecution that is

1344
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:50,720
brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can also tell you personally</font>

1345
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:53,960
having reviewed some of those cases that

1346
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,209
we have consulted against bringing some

1347
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,400
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have in fact not been brought</font>

1348
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:02,839
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hats off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the dutch</font>

1349
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:14,730
authorities USA USA USA

1350
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:16,670
so Flemmi George that doesn't do things

1351
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,839
that so asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> was we wanted</font>

1352
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">prosecutorial guidelines and we wanted</font>

1353
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:23,940
centralization through systems because

1354
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,739
once we met so you're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1355
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">idiots kind of get this and you actually</font>

1356
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:30,210
care about issues so then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like</font>

1357
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,400
oh but<font color="#CCCCCC"> more powerful scooter should have</font>

1358
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:35,460
to talk to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys you actually</font>

1359
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,779
understand computer crime and so the

1360
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that there has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like forward</font>

1361
00:57:36,779 --> 00:57:41,819
motion on that stuff is Super Colon and

1362
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,989
like I'm not bringing this up to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1363
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:45,930
are we asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and they did what</font>

1364
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:47,339
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not what happened at all</font>

1365
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,038
they were already thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

1366
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was just a coincidental timing but</font>

1367
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:55,079
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like that there is progress</font>

1368
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,489
being made which kind of leads us into

1369
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:58,319
the next question so what what

1370
00:57:56,489 --> 00:58:00,660
additional burgers are made where we go

1371
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,950
from here and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think like not</font>

1372
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">only in terms of what you would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1373
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,480
see happen what do you think will

1374
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:11,489
so one of the things that that we see at

1375
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">uff alot is because we're a national</font>

1376
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:15,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually we're a global but for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1377
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:20,758
purpose a national organization is that

1378
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:22,950
federal law is only you know one of 53

1379
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:25,920
plus legal systems the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1380
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:29,339
we have state equivalence to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA in</font>

1381
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,799
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> every state and it's whack</font>

1382
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:35,009
Amole right we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher</font>

1383
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:36,599
exemption passed in Washington yay but

1384
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:38,249
then in<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhode island's they were they</font>

1385
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:41,039
had an update to to their state

1386
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:43,709
equivalent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA that would have</font>

1387
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,900
defined organic devices or would have as

1388
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:47,609
computers they included organic devices

1389
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so they're starting to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1390
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:52,288
interesting future stuff in terms of

1391
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,039
access they also included<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word</font>

1392
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:58,529
approach and in and in in the definition

1393
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:01,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">of computer they included anything that</font>

1394
00:58:58,529 --> 00:59:07,140
can respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a command so you can't</font>

1395
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:09,629
approach a trained dog without

1396
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:10,799
authorization that's now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA violation</font>

1397
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,269
in Rhode Island or it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1398
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:15,749
had we not gotten the bill killed in

1399
00:59:12,269 --> 00:59:17,930
committee so my prediction is probably

1400
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:20,669
no movement in the Fed system and

1401
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:24,799
movement all over the place in every

1402
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,799
conceivable direction in the 50 states

1403
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,069
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of a giant problem</font>

1404
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:30,509
right because the internet doesn't you

1405
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:33,450
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't I don't log into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> texas</font>

1406
00:59:30,509 --> 00:59:36,859
internet you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is</font>

1407
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:41,089
global and and to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

1408
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:44,519
fractured interpretation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA</font>

1409
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:47,009
does does does a ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of harm and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1410
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,069
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could get like</font>

1411
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:52,019
drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and dropping the Civil component</font>

1412
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:54,630
would be lovely and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubt it'll ever</font>

1413
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:58,439
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately I mean that would</font>

1414
00:59:54,630 --> 01:00:00,599
knock out eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notion</font>

1415
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">like all those blue bars like that all</font>

1416
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,080
goes away right on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph find a new</font>

1417
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:08,050
way we're lawyers right

1418
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,540
right is that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other tools out</font>

1419
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:13,750
there for sure there's dmca yeah a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMCA</font>

1420
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,910
there there's the wiretapping which is

1421
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,410
what I think almost always comes along

1422
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,910
with with at least criminal prosecutions

1423
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,589
there's almost always some kind of

1424
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:25,600
wiretapping component to it anyway so

1425
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:27,250
just use that you know and there's there

1426
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,009
there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other bodies of law that</font>

1427
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,460
are that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> better suited to this but</font>

1428
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,450
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love I'm I am</font>

1429
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,340
exceedingly happy with what's going

1430
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's been going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last I'd</font>

1431
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:42,550
say two years 2014 and on you know but

1432
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:45,009
for these blips in houston texas where

1433
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">dentists hackers get get guns pointed at</font>

1434
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:53,740
their faces that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool he is he</font>

1435
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:55,330
hacks dentist software so and hacks

1436
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,339
meaning researches and you know

1437
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:59,380
responsibly and reasonably discloses

1438
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:09,340
vulnerabilities so you guys all just

1439
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:13,780
send Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> Section G you know are we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are we waited to a concept of section G</font>

1441
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:19,870
I think we're wedded to the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1442
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,390
we need a tool that enables us to go

1443
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:23,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">after</font>

1444
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:26,129
the worst of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worst that are</font>

1445
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:28,290
attacking our customers and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

1446
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:31,770
around the world does it have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

1447
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:33,960
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> a criminal statute where it's a</font>

1448
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:36,720
potentially an afterthought not

1449
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,330
necessarily you know the broader point

1450
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,629
is that we look globally for tools that

1451
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:45,569
we can use to stop malware from being

1452
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:47,460
propagated in really harmful ways and we

1453
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:51,480
look for ways to stop bot herders at

1454
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:53,430
scale not you know 1 Z 2 z's but when

1455
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,890
we're seeing a million infections a

1456
01:01:53,430 --> 01:02:00,870
month 3 million infractions a month and

1457
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:04,650
so for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> G is a tool but but its its</font>

1458
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:06,359
relationship to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA is certain just</font>

1459
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:09,510
by virtue of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that it's there</font>

1460
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so does it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it have to stay not</font>

1461
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,830
necessarily we want another<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and</font>

1462
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,950
it's placed gently one better crafted

1463
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:19,680
but we work with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have because</font>

1464
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:22,759
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a duty to protect him very</font>

1465
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,109
good question what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

1466
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,960
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know about the rain it was</font>

1467
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:29,710
arrested gun to his face and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

1468
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:31,839
is he actually charged well I go I can

1469
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:33,540
so I can't connect it sensibly on a

1470
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:36,070
pending matter but I can tell you that

1471
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,910
there was a search which is what was

1472
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:43,089
laid out there there have not been

1473
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:45,910
charges filed that's all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you</font>

1474
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:49,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">know right your gods oh that's a FFL try</font>

1475
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:51,129
to jump on this too I think that's a

1476
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:53,130
part of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we have to be</font>

1477
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:55,630
careful of for security researchers

1478
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:57,280
every case out that there's the fringe

1479
01:02:55,630 --> 01:03:00,250
ones that give a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pressure for</font>

1480
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,260
everything and it depends also goes for

1481
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:04,000
our murder statute consistent I kill

1482
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:05,950
somebody itself that's a nice and

1483
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,109
prosecutor hey am I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be charged</font>

1484
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:10,029
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come back with well it</font>

1485
01:03:08,109 --> 01:03:11,950
depends and you notice the investigation

1486
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:14,920
is going to go out of oil it's

1487
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:16,839
consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our system yeah and I</font>

1488
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to you know be the voice of</font>

1490
01:03:19,089 --> 01:03:24,730
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I do want to be clear</font>

1491
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:26,919
that that it is not defending this

1492
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:28,670
action at all he cannot comment on it

1493
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,839
because it is an ongoing

1494
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:33,299
but he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't hear anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1495
01:03:30,839 --> 01:03:34,950
to set the sound of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like two beds but</font>

1496
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:38,339
let me also say I mean in terms of going

1497
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:41,009
forward in my opinion we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CFA a</font>

1498
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:44,940
like statute and what the reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1499
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:46,890
that is one people of kind of in a hand

1500
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,500
wavy way said cat will just do something

1501
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">else so let's take the wire fraud</font>

1502
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:56,220
statute scheme or artifice to defraud

1503
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,299
someone of money essentially if you want

1504
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:00,089
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's vague and</font>

1505
01:03:57,299 --> 01:04:02,970
broad<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I think you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want us</font>

1506
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:04,710
using that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lewis Pacific technical</font>

1507
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:11,939
statute as intended at least to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1508
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:13,289
the south so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1509
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:17,369
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it depends on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facts</font>

1510
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:19,680
again so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CFA as a</font>

1511
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:22,829
standalone offense and their reasons for

1512
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:26,910
that for example we had tried one

1513
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:29,190
individual and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned through the</font>

1514
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:31,140
appellate court that apparently digital

1515
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,750
information is not considered property

1516
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:37,109
under the internet under state draft of

1517
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:39,630
stolen property statute right those

1518
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:41,609
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen trade secrets well they</font>

1519
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,680
may take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trade secret but trade secret</font>

1520
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:46,440
is a specific term defined under 18 USC

1521
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,660
1839 and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is a trade</font>

1522
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,309
secret so there's a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

1523
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,288
of times of customer lists or credit

1524
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:54,240
card numbers or passwords satisfying the

1525
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:57,720
definition of a trade secret things that

1526
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,819
are often stolen so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is often not as</font>

1527
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,799
simple as finding simply another statute

1528
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:04,349
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug and play depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upon the</font>

1529
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:06,509
facts I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a better place if</font>

1530
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:09,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a statute that reaches</font>

1531
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:13,289
conduct of this sort that is specific to

1532
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:15,230
conduct of this sort let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's move on</font>

1533
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:16,580
to another

1534
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,780
very quickly before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move on to</font>

1535
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,400
questions I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask the</font>

1536
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:23,350
audience question does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

1537
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:29,500
think that should not be an auntie<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

1538
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:29,500
fine hacking that

1539
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:37,830
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biggest concerns I have</font>

1540
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,930
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA is the lack of tolerance</font>

1541
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wendys subjectively interpreted line is</font>

1542
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:44,430
crossed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's normative chillin in to</font>

1543
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,470
worry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I pursue my curiosity I</font>

1544
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:47,730
could risk a felony charge that will

1545
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:50,279
effectively preclude me from ever

1546
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:53,010
getting a job in tech again I mean that

1547
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,620
I'm it's been two years in jail is a

1548
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:57,570
very significant concern but it's also a

1549
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:01,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifelong sentence of never getting a job</font>

1550
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:04,890
and you know some examples of conduct

1551
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,420
which I used to consider fairly

1552
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:08,609
innocuous or what is considered a

1553
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:15,690
reasonable security research but had a

1554
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">CFA a like action against them connect</font>

1555
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:19,860
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chelsea Manning not to defend</font>

1556
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:21,980

01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:39,049
to me but he got successfully convicted

01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:24,960
effectively the computer fraud charge

that he was gone after and that's kind

legal battle so I don't want to give

1598
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:33,299
these examples of other cases of him in

1599
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:37,620
airports where you know there's been

1600

1603
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,750
to see other examples and the ones we

1604
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,850
provided and we

1605
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:51,430
we had on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time so we chose</font>

1606
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:52,960
the ones to Pakistan I think we that's

1607
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:58,779
probably the one that is most relevant

1608
01:08:52,960 --> 01:09:02,470
to this room and I think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1609
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:06,009
most people that I hear from would agree

1610
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:11,680
that weaves case should not create an

1611
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:13,330
expectation that that that kind of

1612
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,180
activity is a violation of the law

1613
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:17,680
however on the flip side you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

1614
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do something two hundred thousand</font>

1616
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:36,099
will debate this with you so I do

1617

appreciate you coming first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

come to it what it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a hostile</font>

1619
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,660
crowd and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jen that I've</font>

1620
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:44,620
heard generally good things when I've

1621
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:47,349
heard c sub speakers but last week is

1622
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:49,509
attending the CLE which is continuing

1623
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:51,520
education for lawyers and one of your

1624
01:09:49,509 --> 01:09:53,920
colleagues Bryan wrestler specifically

1625
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,140
used the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack up in the context of</font>

1626
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,760
we work with companies to jack up the

1627
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:59,440
damages they're claiming that we can get

1628
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">some real prison time for people were</font>

1629
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,490
charging can you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how common</font>

1630
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,990
that is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> C sips because again this is</font>

1631
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:07,929
a senior trial attorney at sea subs I

1632
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:10,000
guess I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

1633
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:12,880
said I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that was the contacts</font>

1634
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,220
right well that I mean I so if the

1635
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,560
question is do we search for additional

1636
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:19,900
charges to pile on to get longer

1637
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,580
sentences additional damages this is

1638
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,809
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the damage calculation specifically</font>

1639
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:25,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers for the PO sentencing</font>

1640
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:27,340
guidelines right so I mean we will

1641
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually ask a victim what was the</font>

1642
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,550
damage there are I think the question

1643
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:33,490
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked the question about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1644
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:36,190
what goes into the hopper there there

1645
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">are things like what were the expenses</font>

1646
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:42,040
you had to incur as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1647
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:43,780
intrusion for example did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1648
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,310
repair your system and scrub them to

1649
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:47,679
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure there was no other backdoor</font>

1650
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:49,180
inserted there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that that</font>

1651
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,620
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do tally up in an attempt to make</font>

1652
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,239
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a reflection of the</font>

1653
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:55,699
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> harm</font>

1654
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:58,638
it would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be appropriate to spurious</font>

1655
01:10:55,699 --> 01:11:01,360
Lee heap on additional offenses are

1656
01:10:58,639 --> 01:11:05,780
damaged that was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually incurred</font>

1657
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:10,219
so I that's the best I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with the</font>

1658
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:12,409
facts you gave me one quick thing on

1659
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:14,570
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i agree</font>

1660
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:18,039
with jen that I think I think the

1661
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:21,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arnheim ER and spitler matter was</font>

1662
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:23,630
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sole case I know of that is</font>

1663
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:27,079
a pure computer security researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFAA</font>

1664
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:30,739
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean as in the purest form and</font>

1665
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:33,018
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard case one</font>

1666
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:35,058
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1667
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:37,460
can say this is actually pointing finger

1668
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:38,780
back at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community is we're trying to</font>

1669
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:42,079
figure out whether there's a way that we

1670
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:45,349
can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys with a way of</font>

1671
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,590
avoiding situations where we are most

1672
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely to prosecute so for example in an</font>

1673
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:51,769
instance where I'd leaves<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred</font>

1674
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,480
and fourteen thousand times with a

1675
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:56,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">script that the information was</font>

1676
01:11:53,480 --> 01:12:00,589
downloaded our ability to distinguish

01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:02,449
between one a bad guy and a good guy

1678
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:05,449
who's now holding a whole lot of private

1679
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:07,759
information that we're not clear why

1680
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:09,049
there was a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to possess may be the</font>

1681
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,510
difference between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we look</font>

1682
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:15,230
at the matter that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

1683
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:17,480
be in stark contrast to saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> prove</font>

1684
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this happened this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible gone</font>

1685
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,308
to the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1686
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:23,750
problem without also having in her hand

1687
01:12:22,309 --> 01:12:25,760
or a whole catch of information that

1688
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">those customers never asked you to</font>

1689
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:32,510
possess so that's that's what we

1690
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,769
struggle way that's true and in the

1691
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,389
perfect world they would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

1692
01:12:33,769 --> 01:12:37,070
that and there wouldn't be another cache

1693
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:39,800
of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the world of that</font>

1694
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:42,889
private information so that that's the

1695
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,889
that's if there are ways in which we can

1696
01:12:42,889 --> 01:12:48,469
get the community to maybe consider some

1697
01:12:45,889 --> 01:12:50,989
ways of adopting practices that will

1698
01:12:48,469 --> 01:12:55,039
reduce the<font color="#CCCCCC"> likelihood of us looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1699
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:56,718
an apt as criminal the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

1700
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,550
very complicated community and finding a

1701

1702
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:02,300
guidance would proliferate it's not

1703
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:05,240
actually

1704
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:08,000
simple um so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer your question</font>

1705
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:11,210
about loss and<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage calculation it's</font>

1706
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,390
exceedingly common so Matthew keys who

1707
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:17,210
is the LA Times reporter who gave login

1719
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:52,430
claimed and the DOJ went with something

1720
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:57,710
like nine hundred thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1721
01:13:52,430 --> 01:14:00,710
Los that and that led to whatever it was

that's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years for you we got 22 years</font>

1725
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:16,250
that's absurd<font color="#E5E5E5"> right why why would it be</font>

1726
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:18,019
that someone who d faces a single web

1728
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,950

it's it's been sentenced I believe they

1747
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,470
didn't appeal I guess I actually don't I

1748
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:09,870
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to whether there was 900 as</font>

1749
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:12,180
another figure i can say that in terms

1750
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:14,309
of characterizing it there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sense</font>

1751
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:17,940
that essentially this is akin to it was

1752
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:19,560
akin to giving someone who you know it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">an arsonist the keys to your neighbor's</font>

house and saying essentially what he

1755
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,780
said which was kid go nuts right now the

1756
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:30,150
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they had taken precautions to</font>

prevent an honester going nuts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1758
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,710

1759
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:37,290
between much grander damage and what in

1760
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:39,360
fact happened but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because of</font>

or wack<font color="#CCCCCC"> vero but I bring up specifically</font>

1763
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:47,130
for the nine hundred thousand dollar

1764
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:48,960
loss calculation 11 articles defacement

1765
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,970
for 45 minutes is not nine hundred

1766
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,570
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care how you</font>

count it

1768
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:11,169
we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> a two hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollars in</font>

1770
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:17,260
500,000 in loss of goodwill and harm for

1771
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:20,050
Microsoft and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sought a permanent</font>

1773
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:24,970
in the malware so we want on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">department injunction and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> total</font>

1776
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:32,259
forum with 75,000 so you know it can

1777
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of ways this egregious example</font>

1778
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,800
but then there's a simple example where

1779
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,570
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went for what we thought was the</font>

1780
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,180
total value and it came back much much

1781
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:41,969
lower so you know it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1782
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,920
wrapped around the examples of

1783
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:48,080
particular cases because they cut<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1784
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:50,840
but I think the underlying point is that

1785
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,970
don't yet have clear parameters or what

1786
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,640
constitutes the actions of researchers

1787
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:57,850
basically crime we continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

1788
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,560
cyber crime at that paradigm of

1789
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:02,180
criminality where we're going after

1790
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,640
individuals were trying to make millions

1791
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars attacking our customers is</font>

1792
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,450
stealing their creds and cleaning up

1793
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,800
their bank accounts versus a researcher

1794
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,960
who's looking at ball and<font color="#CCCCCC"> willfully</font>

1795
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,090
reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different</font>

1796
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,950
paradigm in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA is probably not the</font>

1797
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:18,760
right one and so what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about</font>

1798
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community</font>

1799
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:34,770
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question about bug bounties</font>

1800
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah researchers working talking to it</font>

1801
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:40,949
is this actually on yes oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there</font>

1802
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:42,960
was recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue with the facebook</font>

1803
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Instagram thing where researcher found</font>

1804
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,500
credible or found credentials logged

1805
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,809
into an AWS account use those

1806
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:53,849
credentials to pivot and discover some

1807
01:17:48,809 --> 01:17:56,340
other vulnerabilities yeah and so my

1808
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:59,099
question it really is what does the DOJ

1809
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:03,389
think about researchers exceeding bug

1810
01:17:59,099 --> 01:18:05,250
bounty sort of boundaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

1811
01:18:03,389 --> 01:18:06,510
have an initial authorization and it can

1812
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">be very fuzzy about where that</font>

1813
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:11,130
authorization ends right so I believe

1814
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,050
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so what is this part of</font>

1815
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">justice think about bug bounties and in</font>

1816
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:18,239
an instance where someone perhaps

1817
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:21,000
exceeds the the terms of of the button

1818
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:23,419
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exceeding the germs right so let</font>

1819
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,250
me first<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that we tend to like</font>

1820
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,409
coordinate disclosure policies in part

1821
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:30,780
because it's exactly what the CFA is

1822
01:18:28,409 --> 01:18:32,579
intended to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is instances</font>

1823
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:35,730
where people are doing things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

1824
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:37,409
be not desired by this network owner and

1825
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:40,199
thereby might obtain information they

1826
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:43,379
don't want released or do damage to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1827
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:45,210
network so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like having coordinated</font>

1828
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:48,210
disclosure policies we like bug bounties

1829
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:50,610
and we want those bounties to be

1830
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:55,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-crafted and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear so that there's</font>

1831
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:59,549
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambiguity if one does exceed the</font>

1832
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:01,110
terms of a bug bounty program we would

1833
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:02,849
say yes you have now you are now outside

1834
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:04,409
of your authorization which is why we

1835
01:19:02,849 --> 01:19:07,230
would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask permission rather</font>

1836
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:10,710
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> seek forgiveness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later in the</font>

1837
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:12,860
context of a bug bounty program ideally

1838
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:16,020
those programs again our graph crafted

1839
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:17,159
clearly enough that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible I'll</font>

1840
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:20,710
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to hear whether you think</font>

1841
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:22,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not by and large the case</font>

1842
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:25,540
perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to also think about</font>

1843
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,180
the fact that when you're agreeing to

1855
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,510
what he ended up actually publishing but

1856

they paid him out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't refer</font>

01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:26,040
about that that I think will be

1864
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,809
hardening in terms of the way DoD

1865
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,910
certainly looked at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that program</font>

that you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> news that much is a</font>

1884
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,650
sort of vagueness of the statute

01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,870
suppressing people who would otherwise

1886
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:29,250
sort of like anna discover things in

1887
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:34,320
their youth and go on to do great

1888
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:36,900
wonderful things just from talking to

1889
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,009
metasploit contributors and talking to

1890
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,860
people who want to disclose

1891
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:43,380
vulnerabilities and really kind of don't

said I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ambiguity is is kind of</font>

1894
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:49,980
the core of it right like if you have to

1895
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,390
truck just trust that like prosecutors

1896
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:54,040
are not going to go after you that's

1897
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:55,480
little bit hard it's it's gotten a lot

1898
01:21:54,040 --> 01:22:00,030
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years to make</font>

1899
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:02,530
that case but to also trust that a

1900
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:04,750
company's general counsel is not going

1901

<font color="#E5E5E5">a harder sell right because you know</font>

1903
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,300
because they're there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots</font>

1909
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:22,000
learn their lesson the hard way like I

1910
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:23,710
think you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn that lesson the</font>

1911
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,610
hard way what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> an Oracle tongue but</font>

1912
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:32,650
what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle yeah disclosing to a</font>

1913
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:35,440
company like<font color="#CCCCCC"> shmore achill that that's a</font>

1914
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:36,820
little more fraud right and and really

1915
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,759
when it comes down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a lot of the</font>

1916
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:42,360
bugs that I deal with are in they lately

1917
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:45,700
they've been like an IOT things and in

1918
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,990
you know other like devices that you

1919
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,550
know that don't look like computers with

1920
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:50,860
keyboards or have servers just things

1921
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that and those companies are</font>

1922
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:55,240
learning now like how to do it's like

1923
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:57,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like dealing with Microsoft circa</font>

1924
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:02,050
in 1999 and it's been in that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1925
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:03,760
painful and horrible and i get i get a

1926
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:07,030
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more angry letters from attorneys</font>

1927
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:10,120
from small companies on small firm

1933
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:25,540
actually I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen any from Oakland</font>

1934
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:28,540
time either so I'd also just toss out it

1935
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:30,850
was worth I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we we aren't</font>

1936
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:33,250
in some ways think of the halcyon days

1937
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:35,350
of yore when when fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakers could do</font>

whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want yeah we we think</font>

1939
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:41,200
about like no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no what I will my point</font>

1940
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:44,110
I'm only being actually they got in
