17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,328
today about some things that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling</font>

part of a storytelling series and our

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,760
story begins in 1986 january twenty

eighth nineteen<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty-six at eleven</font>

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,050
thirty nine a.m. the space shuttle

22
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,140
Challenger lifted off the launch pad at

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,048
cape canaveral this was the 25th mission

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,540
of the shuttle series and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

25
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">special mission for some very special</font>

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,860
reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,409
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out about 73 seconds after</font>

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,659
liftoff the right solid booster solid

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,380
rocket booster dislodged there was an

<font color="#CCCCCC">explosion and three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later All</font>

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:28,649
Hands were lost what went wrong NASA had

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,750
a very specific plan to create a program

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,640
of reusability and that program included

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,640
managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk of human lives in</font>

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,909
space this is the 30th<font color="#CCCCCC"> anniversary of</font>

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,939
STS 51<font color="#CCCCCC"> L which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the space shuttle</font>

37
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,829
Challenger this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about managing</font>

38
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,408
risk and that's what the topic is today

39
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,029
so I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> illustrate for you the</font>

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,149
shuttle program what happened in the

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,460
shuttle program and how NASA who has a

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,250
very rigid risk management program

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,199
actually failed themselves by ignoring

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,450
some of the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things that they</font>

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,820
had set in place specifically to deal

46
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,229
with human lives and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to talk</font>

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the shuttle program will have</font>

48
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,710
to kind of go back in time and

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,870
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things they did and</font>

50
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,100
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn some some names and</font>

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,300
things and I'm gonna throw a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,590
names at you but there's really only a

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,030
couple of names I want you to focus on

54
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about that when we get</font>

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,990
there but really again this is a talk

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing risk we want to learn</font>

57
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the lessons of our past so we don't</font>

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,810
repeat them so again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want the</font>

59
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,929
world of yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow we really</font>

60
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,940
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around so the</font>

61
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,890
shuttle program when the shuttle program

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,530
was officially launched it was known as

63
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,450
the space transportation system STS it

64
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,690
was a US government launched manned

65
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,089
launch program it ran from 1980 12 2011

66
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,800
it was designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be reusable and</font>

67
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,170
that's really really important because

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,540
prior to that we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have any kind</font>

69
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reusability we had Rockets that we</font>

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,679
would build we would send them into

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,269
space the Rockets would explode and the

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,489
money would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost that would be it so</font>

73
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,890
we started talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can we get</font>

74
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,440
something that's recoverable so we can

75
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually make space travel economical</font>

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,130
and affordable we can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> things up we</font>

77
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,320
can bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> him down that's what SpaceX is</font>

78
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,940
doing today when they're launching their

79
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,890
rockets out into space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then bringing</font>

80
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,980
them back down in that amazing platform

81
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,450
on rough seas right the dragon x like

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,190
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've ever</font>

83
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,329

84
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,470
this stuff I was alive when they were

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,660
launching the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> shuttles which was</font>

86
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,970
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing thing right when we can</font>

87
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,160
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where we can recycle</font>

88
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,380
this stuff we get to this point where

89
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow economics doesn't become such a huge</font>

90
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,040
factor and we can actually do something

91
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this technology we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can make it into</font>

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,310
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really exciting and</font>

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what the driver is for the space</font>

94
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,299
shuttle<font color="#CCCCCC"> program there was a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

95
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">thirty-five missions that were flown</font>

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,400
between 1981 and 2011 and those missions

97
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,079
were things like carrying payloads doing

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
crew rotations for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Space Station's</font>

99
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,709
recovery of satellites we would not have

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,420
the Hubble today were it not for the

101
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,430
shuttle mission we would not have the

102
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,649
docking ports on the space station Mir

103
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,730
or the International<font color="#CCCCCC"> Space Station if it</font>

104
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,380
wasn't for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shuttle program the</font>

105
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,940
shuttle program enabled all of these

106
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">other programs to happen so it was a</font>

107
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,760
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important part of space travel</font>

108
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:11,100
history to date it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only manned</font>

109
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,429
spacecraft that is orbited and landed

110
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:18,510
which is pretty exciting now the shuttle

111
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,730
program itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA asked for up to 14</font>

billion dollars for sts

113
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,960
Congress approved 5.5 billion what do

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did well they took the</font>

115
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,510
money right but by<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking the money they</font>

116
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,520
had to cut corners absolutely they had

117
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,349
to look at what they had laid out as as

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,180
a forecast to say this is a 14 billion

dollar program<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're only getting five</font>

120
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,830
and a half how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage this to</font>

121
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,130
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they needed to make</font>

122
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">it work okay so let's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back in</font>

123
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,730
time a little bit to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at why we have</font>

124
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,730
to understand history the Apollo program

125
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,410
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manned space flight program 1967</font>

126
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,180
it was conceived during the Eisenhower

127
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,160
administration it was a follow-up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

128
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,860
Project Mercury little little tidbit for

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,260
you there<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Mercury</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capsule could only</font>

130
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,090
hold one astronaut and that was a

131
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem because with only one astronaut</font>

132
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,090
that astronaut has to be everything he

133
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,130
has to be the pilot he's got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,789
scientist he's got to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

135
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,280
right all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one so the the</font>

136
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,220
Apollo program then was created to allow

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,929
three people to fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> into space now we've</font>

138
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,400
got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> options we've got one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

139
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot and then we can have</font>

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,880
mission specialists in the other parts

141
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,710
of the program now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start doing</font>

142
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">some things we can do science right we</font>

143
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,359
can do experimentation what have you the

144
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,169
goal that John F Kennedy set out was to

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,970
eventually put a man on the moon<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

146
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,580
landing men on the moon by the end of

147
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,770
1989 it required really the most sudden

148
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,560
burst of technological creativity we've

149
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,460
ever seen 24 billion dollars was

150
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,200
committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Apollo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program 400,000</font>

151
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were employed directly or</font>

152
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,849
indirectly as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Apollo</font>

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">program supported by 20,000 financial</font>

154
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,680
institutions and universities a massive

undertaking all under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the auspice of</font>

156
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,990
putting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> person on the moon so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

157
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:14,400
Apollo program especially for the time

158
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,530
24 billion dollars in 1967 1966 this is

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,929
a tremendous amount of money and so

160
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,580
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not sure if we should be</font>

161
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,680
doing this what's the goal what's the

162
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,000
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would we do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these</font>

163
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,660
questions are being asked but we're

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,120
pursuing it in February 1967 we had the

165
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,970
Apollo<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 disaster where grissom white</font>

166
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chaffee died on the launch pad</font>

167
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,949
during a test

168
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,710
when the the capsule caught fire and

169
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:44,560
they did not have a proper escape route

170
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:47,859
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capsule right on March night</font>

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,840
march of 1969 Apollo 9 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

172
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,090
first manned space flight tests of the

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,280
lunar<font color="#E5E5E5"> module happens and then in July</font>

174
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,250
twentieth three months later apollo 11

175
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,888
lands<font color="#E5E5E5"> men on the moon so between 1967</font>

176
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,289
and 1969 we learned enough about what we

177
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,879
needed to do to never lose human life

178
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,949
again three astronauts lost their lives

179
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,199
in 67 remember that that's an important

180
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,960
point but then three years later we made

181
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,930
the moon landing we did what we we

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,419
needed to do right so tremendous success

183
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,509
this was an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplishment for</font>

184
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the space program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they completed it</font>

185
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,340
in a compressed<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame which means</font>

186
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,340
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as risk management goes they had</font>

187
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,710
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that they incorporated all</font>

188
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the elements of risk to be able to do</font>

189
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,520
this especially in a compressed time

190
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,879
frame so the Apollo program massively

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,409
successful however massive success

192
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes sets you up for failure</font>

193
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:44,020
because now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to live up to your</font>

194
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,479
past this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

195
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,810
when we get caught in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kinds</font>

196
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,330
of cycles in infosec and we have things

197
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are massively successful products</font>

198
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,830
are deployed companies grow and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

199
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,448
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they go it's never</font>

200
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,300
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> before why would it happen</font>

201
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">again right we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of become victims of</font>

202
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,560
the success of our past so it's really

203
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,719
important to understand Apollo is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

204
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,419
successful so when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shuttle program</font>

205
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,949
comes in when STS starts at stuff they

206
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,710
have to build on the successes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

207
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,060
past which immediately means what

208
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,940
political pressure right we've got

209
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,949
massive amounts of political pressure

210
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,110
but NASA's strong right a<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA will</font>

211
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,940
persevere one of the biggest pieces of

212
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,190
political pressure they had on shuttle

213
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:31,389
mission 25 was this woman anybody who is

214
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that's Christa McAuliffe Christa</font>

215
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,209
McAuliffe is significant because she was

216
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the first civilian in space not</font>

217
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first civilian in space the</font>

218
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,310
first teacher in space she was chosen

219
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,709
from sixteen thousand applicants to go

220
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,899
through astronaut training<font color="#CCCCCC"> trained with</font>

221
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:52,239
astronauts fly in the space shuttle

222
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:54,970
program and deliver a lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> from space</font>

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,959
which was an amazing thing to think

224
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,610
about Christa McAuliffe though

225
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,920
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're younger and you</font>

226
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">weren't around is she was a media</font>

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,560
darling she was genuinely charismatic

228
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,329
she was real she was somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

229
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,489
could relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> now with Christa</font>

230
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,199
McAuliffe going in space we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can all go</font>

231
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">into space this is like the coolest</font>

232
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,339
thing ever so there was a tremendous

233
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,739
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of media coverage and attention</font>

234
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:21,339
around Christa McAuliffe because she was

235
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,170
such this media darling she was on all

236
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,839
the major media programs good morning

237
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,219
america CBS Morning News The Today Show

238
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,490
that's when we only had<font color="#CCCCCC"> three channels</font>

239
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,260
guys all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right The Tonight Show I mean</font>

240
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,819
all this stuff she was she was out there

241
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,699
and everybody loved to everybody loved

242
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,229
Chris McAuliffe so let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

243
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the technical things that actually</font>

244
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,250
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> that led to the failure</font>

245
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,810
remembering we've got these other things

246
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,390
in play and they all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of</font>

247
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,089
lead together so what really<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

248
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,709
was there's these o-rings thats it

249
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,329
inside the solid rocket booster these

250
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,579
o-rings are about 12 feet<font color="#CCCCCC"> in diameter</font>

251
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,680
and what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they feed through</font>

252
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:59,589
the solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocket booster motor joints to</font>

253
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,870
allow flexing when the the shuttle is

254
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,569
being launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because things like</font>

255
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,430
air pressure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gravity are causing</font>

256
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:09,099
these stresses on this vehicle as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

257
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,010
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into orbit right there's this</font>

258
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,589
flexing that needs to happen as heat

259
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,260
causes the gaps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> widen the o-rings</font>

260
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:19,899
have to pop back into the gaps and make

261
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,209
the seal in milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as a flex</font>

262
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,430
happened a gap occurs the rubber in the

263
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,800
o-ring has to expand to fill the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gap if</font>

264
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,050
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't hot gases will escape if</font>

265
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,849
those hot gases escape it's very very

266
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,069
likely those hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> gasses catch fire if</font>

267
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">they catch fire that means an explosion</font>

268
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,370
especially because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the solid rocket</font>

269
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,709
booster is right up against<font color="#CCCCCC"> that main</font>

270
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,360
fuel tank the solid rocket the solid

271
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:44,290
fuel tank right does that make sense

272
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,140
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> got that okay so here's the</font>

273
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,410
issue when they launched from Cape

274
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,870
Canaveral Florida that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day it was 29</font>

275
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,880
degrees in the morning here are some

276
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,000
photographs from the actual launch pad

277
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning these are icicles and this</font>

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,599
is southern<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florida</font>

279
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,799
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> unusual this is a year that</font>

280
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:04,929
the orange crops were completely

281
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,499
decimated because the cold was so severe

282
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:10,809
and so bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we have this</font>

283
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:14,169
issue with cold do you know what happens

284
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:17,469
to rubber when is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cold it stiffens</font>

285
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:20,348
it doesn't flex and problems occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

286
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,119
now we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of NASA engineers</font>

287
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:25,089
anybody the NASA engineers in here no

288
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:26,470
offense<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well at least one we are</font>

289
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:29,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a group of NASA engineers we</font>

290
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,109
understand cold affects the properties

291
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:33,369
of rubber the question is if we know

292
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,789
this and it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of common knowledge</font>

293
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:42,669
why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this wouldn't occur to</font>

294
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:45,220
two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> running this program so what</font>

295
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:48,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened is the o-ring failed there was</font>

296
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,799
a small escape of hot gas the hot gases

297
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,509
caught fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is an explosion the</font>

298
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,159
explosion is not by the way what killed

299
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,749
the astronauts a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

300
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,939
that that's true the explosion what it

301
00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:01,079
did is it dislodged the main cabin that

302
00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:03,789
housed the astronauts and they fell

303
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,978
30,000 feet 40,000 feet hitting the

304
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,600
ocean at a speed of about 300<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles an</font>

305
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:08,769
hour and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> took about three minutes</font>

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,529
of free fall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what they think</font>

307
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,799
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually killed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the crew right</font>

308
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,269
so it wasn't the explosion so why didn't

309
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,809
anybody anticipate the scenario why do

310
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think we know that rubber doesn't</font>

311
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:26,589
work under pressure why do you think

312
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,569
nobody anticipated this Oh somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

313
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:31,439
said it who said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

314
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:34,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they did they absolutely did</font>

315
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:36,129
they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> what would happen now I'm</font>

316
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,899
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in retrospect right</font>

317
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:40,419
they knew it would happen because we now

318
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,699
know they knew it would happen but the

319
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:45,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">steps that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took for us to figure out</font>

320
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:47,108
why they knew it would happen are all

321
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,878
the failures that I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

322
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:50,169
managing risk that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

323
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,529
come out here that's what's part of this

324
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:57,819
story very specifically written

325
00:12:53,529 --> 00:13:00,699
documentation showed that they had proof

326
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these problems happened with their</font>

327
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,748
o rings which we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little</font>

328
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,039
bit so this man up here is George Hardy

329
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,539
you don't remember these names I'm just

330
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,689
pointing out George Hardy and this is

331
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:12,730
Larry Malloy these were people in NASA

332
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:16,449
who were part of

333
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,930
what was going on when the engineers at

334
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:21,370
a contractor called<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiokol went to</font>

335
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,930
their superiors and said we are very

336
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,139
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned about the shuttle launch</font>

337
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,479
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's too cold and the</font>

338
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,699
o-rings will not perform if it's under

339
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,070
53 degrees we think you should scrub the

340
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:35,979
launch ok this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contractor of the</font>

341
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,269
solid fuel rocket booster right they go

342
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,620
to their management and say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

343
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,089
problem the management goes well what's

344
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem it's these these tolerances</font>

345
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,110
these temperatures we have an issue we

346
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,649
have to make sure that they don't launch

347
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,389
so they have a convene about 6 p.m. the

348
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,399
night before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the launch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the management</font>

349
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,870
calls up NASA they go NASA we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

350
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,850
think you should launch NASA's like what

351
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,350
and these are some quotes I'm appalled

352
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,910
I'm appalled by your recommendation not

353
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,680
to launch when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want me to launch</font>

354
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,689
next April here's what you have to

355
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,000
understand this particular shuttle

356
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,500
mission which all eyes are on because

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christa McAuliffe is the first civilian</font>

358
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,399
in space<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already gone through three</font>

359
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,599
scrubs they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had three times where</font>

360
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,570
they were going to go to launch and they

361
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,820
didn't it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the exact same day as</font>

362
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:18,880
the State of the Union speech by the

363
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,440
president now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some research</font>

364
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,209
done to see if any of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

365
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,370
related and there wasn't any concrete

366
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,199
evidence found that these things are

367
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,940
related that their political pressure

368
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,800
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so great that they had to launch on</font>

369
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,480
that day so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> president could talk to</font>

370
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,430
Christa McAuliffe from space but

371
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,319
anecdotally it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably there and</font>

372
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:38,109
there are issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that will</font>

373
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at here in a minute right so all</font>

374
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,040
this comes out later by the way through

375
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,690
this investigative body that we call the

376

385
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,089
physicist Richard Feynman is going to be

386
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,440
the focus of the rest of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

387
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's a fascinating</font>

388
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,790
individual that really went outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

389
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,709
realm of what he was tasked to do to

390
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,380
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these problems were and</font>

391
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,880
I credit him for finding these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

392
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,250
risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> management and really bringing them</font>

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,920
to light but suffice to say these are

394
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,230
important people the two people that I

395
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember though are Richard</font>

396
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,250
who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Nobel Prize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> winning physicist</font>

397
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,189
on the panel and this is Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katina</font>

398
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,370
he's a general well entrenched in NASA

399
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:39,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows all about the space program</font>

400
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,860
he was a fighter pilot he was involved

401
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:44,650
in many many many aspects it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also turns</font>

402
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,350
out that he was super politically savvy

403
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,170
and a puppet master and he is the reason

404
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,140
that we know what went on today why it

405
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,479
went why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we also have a special</font>

406
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,620
guest that I'll talk about later now one

407
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,450
thing you have to understand is I'm a

408
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,400
thespian and so we have this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">theater where we draw the curtain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

410
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,280
slowly so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to tell you who</font>

411
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,600
this is now until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end because that's</font>

412
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,160
all suspense and drama that I get to

413
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,800
build up and that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me right so</font>

414
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Feynman or Fineman however you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

415
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,550
say it um he gets this job because he

416
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,960
has this in quitted inquisitive nature

417
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,030
they call him up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they say we want</font>

418
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this job and he goes I'm a</font>

419
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,120
physicist I'm not a politician I don't

420
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,630
want to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this this is</font>

421
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,220
ridiculous his wife when a--the says all

422
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,510
right look if you don't do this here's

423
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,490
what's going to happen they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

424
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,410
get 12 people these 12 people are all

425
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,510
going to walk around in a group doing

426
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and seeing things and seeing the</font>

427
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,689
same things and coming to the same

428
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,130
conclusions if they pick you they're

429
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have 11 people going around</font>

430
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,520
doing the same things coming to the same

431
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,950
conclusions and one guy running around

432
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,510
figuring everything out he's like yeah

433
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and that was</font>

434
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,170
Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Feynman he was the guy running</font>

435
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,310
around figuring everything out chairman

436
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,170
Rogers even told him<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than once</font>

437
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,150
you're a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ass stop it you're</font>

438
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,620
causing problems he actually wanted him

439
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,360
to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the investigative efforts he was</font>

440
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,460
doing fine man was<font color="#E5E5E5"> never really sure</font>

441
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,650
where his line was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he just started</font>

442
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,810
crossing them he's like all right well

443
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> officially tell</font>

444
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,710
me I can't do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

445
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it right so he had a somewhat of a</font>

446
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,819
shaky start people were upset with

447
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,129
Richard Feynman because he was asking

448
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,750
questions right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't like to</font>

449
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">be asked questions especially when</font>

450
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,599
they're put on the spot now think about

451
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,280
it we've had a shuttle disaster it's a

452
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,629
national<font color="#E5E5E5"> disaster we've had all this</font>

453
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,730
media attention around Christa McAuliffe

454
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,380
it's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal all eyes are on what's</font>

455
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,620
happening the Rogers Commission people

456
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,820
are very very very nervous and some

457
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy guys asking them a bunch of</font>

458
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,149
questions right what's their first

459
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,889
inclination right as little as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

460
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,940
information fed kind of like working

461
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,830
with an auditor right

462
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,480
when you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an auditor you answer</font>

463
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,850
the questions the auditor asks and you

464
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,250
don't volunteer more information now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

465
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,719
love auditors I volunteer more

466
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,570
information I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely different</font>

467
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,490
individual because I understand what

468
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,840
that gets us in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of helping us go</font>

469
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward so did Richard fine man so I</font>

470
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,289
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think up a little bit like him</font>

471
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know without the brains and stuff</font>

472
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,789
right but really fineman's big

473
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,469
disappointment here is he doesn't like

474
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,309
the sterile conditions of the testimony

475
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,690
because what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in these</font>

476
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:09,428
congressional hearings is they're

477
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,080
pulling people up there sitting in front

478
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,029
of a congressional inquiry it has a

479
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">rodgers Commission there and senators</font>

480
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,539
and congressmen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're</font>

481
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,769
testifying in front of a microphone you

482
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,149
know similar to some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font>

483
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this political season right that's</font>

484
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:21,580
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it's going in fineman's</font>

485
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,289
going nuts because he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a politician</font>

486
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,299
he's like no I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

487
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,100
engineers and he gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

488
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,720
engineers once or twice and they start

489
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,279
telling him stuff he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm really</font>

490
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,659
excited by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he's a technical</font>

491
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,159
guy even though he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't understand</font>

492
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,750
you know space travel in the space

493
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,100
program he gets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to them about</font>

494
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,750
their technical problems and he said

495
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,299
yeah tell me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problems and he</font>

496
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,210
really starts to figure out what these

497
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,889
route indicators are that wind up being

498
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,779
the total problem at the end but only

499
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:48,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they let him talk to the subject</font>

500
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter experts and that's one of our</font>

501
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,240
lessons here is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to listen to our</font>

502
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,980
subject matter experts especially when

503
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,899
we're dealing with risk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

504
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,549
to the people who understand most about

505
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:59,500
what that risk is to get the information

506
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make a decision that's exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

507
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,940
fineman's doing right so he starts

508
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:05,918
meeting with engineers he's making these

509
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,549
small discoveries and he's figuring out

510
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,039
that these are smart enough people that

511
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,408
they should have known that these rubber

512
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,330
seals were a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out they did</font>

513
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:18,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they have written documentation to</font>

514
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,019
show it but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what he's suspecting</font>

515
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:22,000
at this time he's running around he's

516
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:23,259
like yes I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what you're</font>

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,590
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have all this great</font>

518
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:28,240
knowledge so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the deal he</font>

519
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,879
makes the first of several<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

520
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,789
discoveries if the technical people know

521
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:37,539
what's going on but there was no

522
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,700
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one has discussed the</font>

523
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,529
problems between their flights every

524
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,450
single shuttle mission the 24 prior

525
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,789
shuttle missions showed problems with

526
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,919
the o-rings they have a thing in in

527
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:50,080
space travel where they do a flight

528
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,549
safety prep check they do a check before

529
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,809
the launch they do a check after the

530
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,590
launch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they followed their</font>

531
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,570
procedures

532
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,980
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter every single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these</font>

533
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,950
checks showed problems with the o-rings

534
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">for 24 missions but they lucked out 24</font>

535
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,679
times and it never failed it was never

536
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,139
talked about between flights and he went

537
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,940
why why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not talk about this</font>

538
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">between flights and the answer he got</font>

539
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,220
back was because there wasn't a failure

540
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,409
what was there to talk about right has

541
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,029
this happened to you have you had issues

542
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,549
where things go wrong but they're not

543
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,950
talked about until something<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong</font>

544
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:26,740
and causes you to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it why</font>

545
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,860
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that this is 30 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

546
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">why are we still doing that that makes</font>

547
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,809
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense right we want to be able to</font>

548
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">have these conversations if you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">managing risk risk is all about</font>

550
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,690
communication you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to establish</font>

551
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,100
those lines of communication and talk

552
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

553
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,330
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear so you can discuss why</font>

554
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,000
the problems or problems which is what

555
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,158
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been doing here the</font>

556
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,500
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they dug up actually</font>

557
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,390
mentioned the joint seal as being most

558
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,070
critical to operations so what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ol</font>

559
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,399
ring was sealing up it's the most

560
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,220
critical piece of the flight but then

561
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:04,899
the report also says that safe flying

562
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,480
can continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they pass their</font>

563
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:08,678
checklist and fireman goes wait if we

564
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,049
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we rate as</font>

565
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,760
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical why would it not be</font>

566
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,220
absolutely critical why would we say

567
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,809
it's okay to fly it shouldn't be every

568
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,610
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these other 24</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reports said we</font>

569
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,830
had failures if it's critical in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

570
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure you don't fly that's his</font>

571
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:26,980
conclusion why are we flying it's a good

572
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,080
question he also makes another critical

573
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,990
discovery when he looks into the

574
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer simulations they had poor risk</font>

575
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,210
tolerance so here's what happens

576
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,800
there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are making</font>

577
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,429
decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're making decisions</font>

578
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,190
based on their available information and

579
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:53,530
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did is they said okay if we</font>

580
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a set of conditions that executes</font>

581
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:00,040
under these conditions and it causes us

582
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,110
not to fly how can reduce the

583
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,110
expectation of the conditions to get us

584
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,459
to fly so effectively what they did is

585
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,719
they took the risk tolerance which they

586
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,640
already had here and said we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

587
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,960
lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human life which came directly</font>

588
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,150
out of the Apollo<font color="#E5E5E5"> program remember we've</font>

589
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,190
lost three astronauts we will not do

590
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,430
anything to lose a human life the actual

591
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,350
quote is something like if any party

592
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,600
disagrees that this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in</font>

593
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,570
human life is at risk we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly but</font>

594
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,699
at NASA they decided to shrink their

595
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,110
criteria so their risk tolerance got

596
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,450
lower and lower until they allowed

597
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,240
something to happen have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> encountered</font>

598
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,130
this before perhaps in your jobs where

599
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,990
we we know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a set of criteria and</font>

600
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,550
we say these criteria<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist for this</font>

601
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,020
reason and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work within these</font>

602
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,879
criteria we know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and when</font>

603
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,650
the criteria change all of a sudden we

604
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,910
get unpredictable results that's risk

605
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,920
management the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is happening</font>

606
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,090
at NASA but it's a little bit more

607
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,220
critical because they're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

608
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,300
human lives maybe an infosec we're not

609
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,660
dealing with human lives all the time

610
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,830
but we've got medical IOT now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

611
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">be paying attention to these same</font>

612
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:02,830
lessons we should be learning from this

613
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,780
so Fineman um he's a ghast at these

614
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,220
discoveries like he's just his mind is

615
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,020
blown the other people are politicians

616
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,910
are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> add happens all the time right</font>

617
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,430
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that's that's the way it works</font>

618
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,140
right so he's going in a no-no so he's

619
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking like like how can we assess this</font>

620
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,260
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so he goes to the</font>

621
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,410
National Air and Space Museum and at

622
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,210
this point he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really down on NASA he's</font>

623
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,040
like I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys let this</font>

624
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and that's kind of a quote they</font>

625
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,480
let this happen he goes to the National

626
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,940
Air and Space Museum and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> director of</font>

627
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,240
NASA brings him through there and shows

628
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,240
him a film on what it took to actually

629
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,380
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space program going and</font>

630
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,290
something clicked with him and he went

631
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,380
wow I can't believe this many people

632
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">were involved in this massive effort put</font>

633
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,180
all this time money and energy into it

634
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it failed it was I can't believe</font>

635
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and he changed his mind set</font>

636
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:56,109
being anti NASA to being<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro NASA to go</font>

637
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:59,139
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are awesome and you do awesome</font>

638
00:23:56,109 --> 00:24:00,279
things and let's find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out why you had</font>

639
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:01,809
this failure and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

640
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:04,059
suggesting to you if you're in a

641
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,739
situation where you're facing some real

642
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,839
negativity and you're really sort of

643
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:10,119
against what these forces that are

644
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,639
causing you this negativity understand

645
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,129
what the drivers are behind those forces

646
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:16,779
try to change your mindset it will help

647
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:18,099
you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're assessing that risk</font>

648
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:19,450
because it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you with things</font>

649
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:21,849
like that risk tolerance because maybe

650
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,989
you can reduce the tolerance a little

651
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:25,178
bit just not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level that you're</font>

652
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:26,649
being requested that's that's working

653
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,389
right that's moving room that's you

654
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:31,109
negotiating and that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and</font>

655
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:34,209
that helps and it helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman a lot</font>

656
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:36,309
but this is the cool part so there's a

657
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,379
key moment so general<font color="#CCCCCC"> katina remember I</font>

658
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">told you about general Katina he has</font>

659
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:43,478
Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Feynman over for dinner and he's</font>

660
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,700
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and he brings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him to</font>

661
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:47,109
the garage<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showing him as 1973</font>

662
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,419
opal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman knows nothing about</font>

663
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:51,039
cars and could care less Katinas going

664
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,989
yeah this is my car been working on it

665
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and oh that's the carburetor over there</font>

666
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:55,749
and you know what's funny I've been

667
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on the carburetor and I noticed</font>

668
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:59,619
something that when it's really really

669
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,149
cold the seals in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carburetor they</font>

670
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:03,189
don't work right what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

671
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:07,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens to seals when it gets really</font>

672
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:12,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">cold finding goes well they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work</font>

673
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:14,349
aha and he has an aha moment this was

674
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:17,139
absolutely orchestrated by kortina find

675
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:19,450
men later says in his memoirs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm pretty</font>

676
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:22,269
sure somebody told him<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was the</font>

677
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,599
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he directed me toward it in</font>

678
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:27,879
his way in 2012 we find out he's

679
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,619
absolutely correct that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly what</font>

680
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:32,468
happened right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will talk about how</font>

681
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:33,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened because it's brilliant so</font>

682
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:35,259
the engineers concerns are starting to

683
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:37,359
come to light so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing this</font>

684
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:40,599
is Alan McDonald he was one of the chief

685
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:42,728
engineers on the NASA side I believe he

686
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,718
comes to a public meeting uninvited<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

687
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,700
they're having these hearings<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

688
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:48,580
Rogers Commission hearings and this guy

689
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,139
walks<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his engineers and sits</font>

690
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">down no I'm sorry Alan McDonald word for</font>

691
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">thiokol he wasn't asset he was thiokol</font>

692
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:54,999
the solid rocket booster makers and he

693
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">sits down and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like well who are</font>

694
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,149
you and he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm both I a call and</font>

695
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,349
they're like well why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here he</font>

696
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:02,589
goes because I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to offer testimony</font>

697
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:04,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and here's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said we recommended</font>

698
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,840
to NASA that they do not fly under 53

699
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,360
degrees

700
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,340
this is shocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Commission they</font>

701
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,500
had not heard this before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd heard</font>

702
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,120
all this testimony and nobody had said

703
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a recommendation not to</font>

704
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,908
launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said well is that true and</font>

705
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,168
they said yes but we reversed ourselves

706
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,760
under pressure from NASA which is

707
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,380
exactly what happened the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiokol</font>

708
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,240
management went to NASA they said guys

709
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,700
don't launch NASA said when are we

710
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,440
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to launch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thiokol went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

711
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,510
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and internally they had</font>

712
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,549
some problems where<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiokol said to the</font>

713
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,870
engineers take off your engineering hat

714
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:37,299
for a minute and put on your management

715
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,418
hat so we can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out which</font>

716
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">means we disregarded our SMEs we</font>

717
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,960
disregarded the knowledge that they were

718
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,309
they were giving us right that's

719
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,720
effectively would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

720
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Commission had never heard this this is</font>

721
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,350
the first time the hearing us and they

722
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,960
are genuinely shocked<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman is pretty</font>

723
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:54,279
convinced that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he knew that they had a</font>

724
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,080
temperature problem with the o-rings by

725
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,539
this time he's like all evidence points

726
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,289
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that they knew but he has to</font>

727
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:04,210
figure out how to show that they knew

728
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:08,020
without having documentation that

729
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,220
officially proves that so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far we know</font>

730
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's problems with the seals</font>

731
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not properly communicated out</font>

732
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,189
right that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the suspicions</font>

733
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,199
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to prove our theory we</font>

734
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,240
know we had problems with Morton Thiokol

735
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,429
management bowing to pressure and we

736
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,919
know NASA is accepting risk beyond their

737
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:25,809
tolerance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a recipe for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disaster at</font>

738
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,880
this point we know this but again we

739
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,230
only know this in hindsight that's the

740
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with risk management when we</font>

741
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,279
manage risk we manage risk in the moment

742
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,989
and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to manage risk</font>

743
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,090
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future because the conditions of</font>

744
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,919
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so much which means</font>

745
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,510
when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> managing risk and you have</font>

746
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,700
constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to stick to those</font>

747
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,100
constraints as closely as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you possibly</font>

748
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,130
can so the outcome becomes what you want

749
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,918
the outcome to be does that make sense

750
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay NASA is not doing that all right so</font>

751
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,520
fineman's looking for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers so</font>

752
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:58,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fineman does something that is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pivotal</font>

moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in in the discovery he stages an</font>

754
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:04,870
experiment and what he does is he gets a

755

glass of<font color="#E5E5E5"> water and he's got an o-ring</font>

00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:19,549
doing after

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,729
a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman reaches for his mic and</font>

764
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:25,010
katina goes no not yet Hyman's like okay

765
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,240
right let's another minute go by reaches

766
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,540
her as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Katina goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben and a hold</font>

767
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,070
on not yet oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

768
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,440
minute passes he reaches included Tina

769
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,990
goes hold on he goes when he gets to the

770
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,100
testimony where he's saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

771
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,200
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imma goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Larry</font>

772
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,820
Malloy is testifying he gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

773
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,860
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says and we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

774
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,450
indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> find me goes excuse me and he</font>

775
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,178
pulls the o-ring seal out of the water

776
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,940
and he'd had a seat clamp on it pulls a

777
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:56,059
c-clamp out and the thing very very very

778
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,500
slowly starts going back into shape and

779
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,120
he has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous quote where he says I</font>

780
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,070
believe this has some significance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

781
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,530
our problem because remember they were

782
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to pop back in milliseconds the</font>

783
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,030
press went crazy they saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment</font>

784
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,679
I mean this was drama right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

785
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,750
drive as a thespian this is what we live

786
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,750
for right this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the critical moment</font>

787
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic this is amazing and he</font>

788
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,410
makes this this sort of critical

789
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,230
discovery that should have been obvious

790
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,690
to everybody which it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it was</font>

791
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,510
obvious to everybody but we ignored the

792
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,429
obvious nosov it and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what was</font>

793
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:31,190
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the politics in</font>

794
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:33,260
play right so the press is reporting

795
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,730
that NASA<font color="#E5E5E5"> is under great political</font>

796
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,660
pressure to launch after this this

797
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,370
actually turns the heat up on NASA

798
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">katina is a really keen political</font>

799
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,309
observer he points out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

800
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,809
Commission<font color="#CCCCCC"> has many weaknesses in its</font>

801
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,450
membership basically everybody's tied to

802
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,280
NASA fineman's the only outsider and so

803
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,590
he's tellin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fineman you're the only one</font>

804
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can really get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth of what</font>

805
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,850
happens here because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the person</font>

806
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,280
who comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside and doesn't</font>

807
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:00,350
have any emotional attachment to what's

808
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,240
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on he was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact-finder</font>

809
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,799
somebody from the outside and this is

810
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,120
why I sale of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Auditors because really</font>

811
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,470
that's what auditors are there fact

812
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,030
finders especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they come from</font>

813
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,470
the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be internal auditors are</font>

814
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,879
a little too close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it right but</font>

815
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,750
external auditors<font color="#CCCCCC"> their fact finders</font>

816
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,090
that's how they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be viewed</font>

817
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,470
somebody who can help us determine what

818
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,600
these root causes are and when we're

819
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,570
managing risk sometimes we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need an extra</font>

820
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,070
pair of eyes to give us that

821
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,379
fact-finding opportunity right we're

822
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,760
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> too blind by our own pressures by</font>

823
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,740
our own politics by<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else</font>

824
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,760
that's happening to actually see what we

825
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to see so Sally Ride for an</font>

826
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,280
instance she still had a job with NASA

827
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fineman was the invincible man Neil</font>

828
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,790
Armstrong was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consultant for NASA so</font>

829
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,590
even though these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are amazing people</font>

830
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,850
they've done amazing things they still

831
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,389
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these very strong ties they're</font>

832
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,100
blinded by what they're involved in

833
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,290
right some of the other political forces

834
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,969
Reagan had announced in 1986 the shuttle

835
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,110
program will within a year put a teacher

836
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,960
in space called the teacher in space

837
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,520
program so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are focused on getting a</font>

838
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,710
teacher in space there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

839
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,150
politics behind this because the

840
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,470
president makes this announcement there

841
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,970
are people who want to please<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

842
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">president and they're going to do these</font>

843
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so maybe there wasn't direct</font>

00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">thumb2 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noah's pressure on getting</font>

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,690
this done but certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you work in</font>

846
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the government and the president issues</font>

848
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,950
can do to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen right shuttle</font>

849
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,510

he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe it this is true</font>

852
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,040
but here's what I'll tell you I believe

853
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were probably some people who</font>

854
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,090
are ambitious who wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it was an awesomely staged event again</font>

857
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,230
there is no direct proof of that but we

858
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,820
can speculate we can say probably there

859
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,790
were people with some ambition and maybe

860
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,919
some ego that caused that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> occur</font>

861
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,500

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,730
around christa mcauliffe and up to now

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,220
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had these significant launch</font>

864

delays these are all problems that

865
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,480
NASA's facing when they decide that

866
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,300
they're not going to scrub this fourth

867
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,850
time right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying it's right</font>

868
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,860
or wrong I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on what</font>

869
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,060
was happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the focus of what they</font>

that's what's happening to you when you

you don't see is some of these other

and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy going but we</font>

looked at security architecture for this

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,809
same things are happening today right

891
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,009
well the engineers spoke out

892
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,168
and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Alan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> McDonald</font>

more probative inquiry and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

895
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,309
asked the engineers raise your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand if</font>

you were in favor of the launch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

897
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,059
a single hand went up and they're like

898
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,178
okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman goes let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you this</font>

899
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:04,129
who's your most important engineer who

900
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:06,169
understands o-rings and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> name names</font>

901
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:08,330
they named<font color="#E5E5E5"> raja lee thompson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cap'n birds</font>

902
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,700
he's like okay three of those people are

903
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,949
here what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think mr. Raja broadly</font>

904
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,600
they said I recommended we didn't launch

905
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,919
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you think I recommended we</font>

906
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,019
didn't launch what did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended we didn't launch yet the</font>

908
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,639
testimony is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was roughly evenly</font>

909
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,950
divided in the decision to launch our

910
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,779
not to launch fineman's going that

911
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,090
doesn't make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't be true</font>

912
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:30,619
you know you're playing politics and

913
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,970
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root of this</font>

914
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:36,168
problem why are we having these issues

915
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,119
this doesn't make sense so he talks to

916
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,159
the managers who say the workers aren't

917
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:41,689
as disciplined as they used to be so at

918
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thiokol they're like yeah these they</font>

919
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,480
used to follow all the instructions now

920
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:46,669
they don't when he talks to the workers

921
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,899
he's like they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything they</font>

922
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,299
were supposed to do they're doing it by

00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:53,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">the numbers when he talks to the the</font>

00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:54,740
workers alone with one manager present

925
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,389
the managers surprised to find out that

926
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,249
the workers wanted to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

927
00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,168
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the managers wanted to</font>

928
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,610
shield them from having to go through

these are all communication issues these

936
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,369
are all breakdowns in communication

937
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,259
management thinks that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

938
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,730
that maybe isn't a problem the workers

939
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,129
think that there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't</font>

level to accept a higher tolerance for

up to management in one case the flight

commander at NASA was never made aware

passed that on to the flight commander

who would have immediately scrub the

rule which says if anyone disagrees we

979
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,890
do not launch because human lives are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">had faith in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine finding has</font>

997
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,619
this great quote what is the cause of

998
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:34,390
management's fantastic faith in the

999
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,190
machinery I will turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on you a</font>

1000
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,779
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

1001
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,109
management's great faith<font color="#CCCCCC"> in technology</font>

1002
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,640
today why do our managers<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

1003
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,990
there's a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> red button for security</font>

1004
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,629
that says we're secure why why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1005
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:56,118
think why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1006
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:57,619
what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not tap into each</font>

1007
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:02,690
other what<font color="#CCCCCC"> else what what other kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1008
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:06,950
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you think of they want to</font>

1009
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:13,549
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it money money right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

1010
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:18,230
say easy answer right messenger<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1011
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:20,269
shot trust if you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a failure</font>

1012
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,759
everything is working that's exactly

1013
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:24,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">right if we have never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a failure</font>

1014
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:26,450
before why would we see a failure in the

1015
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:28,609
future here's what i'll counter with

1016
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:31,490
that though to you it's a valid question

1017
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:34,038
to ask you have to prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you have to</font>

1018
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:37,758
prove why you think it will fail in the

1019
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:39,440
future where you say yeah bonuses

1020
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,450
incentive right all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things but</font>

1021
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,009
really what don't what don't they

1022
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,598
understand about the fact that we need

1023
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:45,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the secure architecture and the</font>

1024
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,849
things these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things you need to</font>

1025
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,079
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> right complexity is</font>

1026
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:53,029
definitely an issue how do you explain

1027
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you explain it right a big red</font>

1028
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,730
button is easy what you're talking about

1029
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,599
it has all these moving parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1030
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,599
like it right

1031
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,860
absolutely there's so there's the

1032
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,910
knee-jerk right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1033
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,230
anything and we have to have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1034
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,029
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden dollar</font>

1035
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,440
signs start going off and people have

1036
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,520
birds and stars flying around their

1037
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,830
heads because they're knocked out with

1038
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,150
how crazy this is right<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a lack of</font>

1039
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,980
understanding so again it comes back to

1040
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,100
communication you need to communicate

1041
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,510
this is the most important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

1042
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,450
decision to launch contributors we've

1043
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,770
got the 1958 mercury prop Project

1044
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,240
Mercury operational ground rule which

1045
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,800
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already told you no man's flight</font>

1046
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,330
undertaken until all parties responsible

1047
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,220
felt perfectly assured everything was

1048
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,500
ready they ignored it this had been in

1049
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,200
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> since nineteen fifty-eight right</font>

1050
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,910
the Apollo<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 disaster happened because</font>

1051
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a failure of equipment it did not</font>

1052
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen because parties were not in</font>

1053
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,470
agreement and there were other launches

1054
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were scrubbed because party were in</font>

1055
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:50,200
agreement but they ignored<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1958</font>

1056
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:53,140
operational ground rule we had engineers

1057

who expressing the safety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> orings they</font>

1058
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,790
had presented a convincing argument to

1059
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,820
their management at<font color="#CCCCCC"> thiokol larry malloy</font>

1060
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,540
said the data is inconclusive at NASA

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,130
Gerald Mason<font color="#CCCCCC"> and one of the managers</font>

take off your engineering have put on

1063
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,980
your management hat right all of these

1064
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are happening that are</font>

1065
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,120
contributing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this failure it's not</font>

1066
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:13,089
one thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lesson here it's</font>

1067
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,529
never about one thing it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1068
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,570
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we start to sum</font>

them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and they aggregate it becomes</font>

1070
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:22,120
awful the final launch decision belong

1071
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,800
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jesse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more he was informed of</font>

the launch he was never informed that

they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> unaware of things like the</font>

failures guess what happens februari

third of 2003<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast-forwarding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

1090
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,450
the same thing happens this is the

shuttle Columbia the shuttle columbia

1092
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,569
disintegrated on impact and what they

1093
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">found when they investigated the shuttle</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Columbia was the same failures in a risk</font>

why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did those same failures happen</font>

1098
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,880
that's a whole nother talk right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">political pressures that were happening</font>

1100
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,560
at the time but how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

1101
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">better which is really the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core of</font>

astronauts to management positions

1107
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,600
basically what they're saying is make

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,609
your subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter experts the</font>

1109
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,170
operational manage the operational

00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,060
activities this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

1111
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,040
happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should not have</font>

1112
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,390
managers managing operational activities

1113
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,550
who don't understand the operation

1114
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,750
because management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and operations are</font>

1115
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,220
two different disciplines there are two

1116
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,110
different philosophies and when you're

1117
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,879
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an organization that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1118
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,950
operationally entrenched like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Space</font>

1119
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Flight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have subject matter</font>

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">in management they recommended that they</font>

1122
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,750
redefine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responsibilities and maybe</font>

00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to maybe</font>

1124
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,590
you have to redefine responsibilities so

1125
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:10,020
the people who are right for those roles

1126
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,550
as we say aces in their places right

1127
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,230
that they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice that they need</font>

1128
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that they get there and they get</font>

1129
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,770
to where they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the Commission</font>

1130
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,390
record recommended they establish an

1131
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,770
advisory panel with representation for

1132
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,350
many different<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations</font>

1133
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,970
absolutely that's what a review board is

1134
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,279
like a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> review board right</font>

1135
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,390

hard for anybody else to understand

1162
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,600
we're all guilty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this our industry</font>

1163
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,810
can have entire conversations using 12

1164
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,250
letters that's insane to an outsider

1165
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,380
they have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that means right</font>

1166
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:36,280
we need to work on this this is one this

1167
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,930
one's on us so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna jump forces or</font>

1168
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,130
jump forward a little bit here the force

1169
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,359
is working against you when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1170
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,670
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you've got political forces</font>

1171
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,860
economic forces ego and ambition these

1172
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,270
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things that conspire to work</font>

1173
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,980
against you and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1174
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,570
overcome but you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of</font>

1175
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,490
them so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage them when they</font>

1176
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,920
happen you may not be aware of the

1177
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,419
politics so become aware ask questions

1178
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,730
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may not be aware of the economics</font>

1179
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,620
ask questions right ego and ambition

1180
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,730
these are personal problems either these

1181
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,160
are things were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into and</font>

1182
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,660
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be issues establishing</font>

a rift spring the first thing in any

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,750
risk assessment is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish the</font>

frame include assumptions and

1186
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,930
constraints it's so important because

1187
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,850
that's what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work under</font>

1188
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,980
when you're managing risk these are this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is my set of Tolerance this is what I</font>

have to manage to and be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fineman</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Fineman is just a pain in the ass</font>

1192
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,600
walking around asking questions asked

1193
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,320
questions don't just assume something is

1194

a skit it's really really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1195
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so let me jump to hear the human</font>

1196
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,390
component I've talked to you about

1197
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,100
Richard Feynman I talk to you about

1198
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">katina I've said Katina was a mastermind</font>

1199
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fineman in his memoir said I think</font>

1200
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,970
Katina heard it from somebody at NASA

1201
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,910
probably an astronaut that these o-rings

1202
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:45,450
had a problem but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't prove that</font>

1203
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:48,339
Katina never said a word until 2012 in

1204
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:51,430
2012 he said I was walking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hall</font>

1205
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,080
next to an astronaut at NASA they pulled

1206
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,370
a piece of paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the notebook and</font>

1207
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,720
handed it to me without looking at it

1208
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that piece of paper were two</font>

1209
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,490
columns on one side was temperature and

1210
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:03,609
on the other side was resilience of the

1211
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,560
o-rings this was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA internal memo so</font>

1212
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:08,080
they knew at NASA<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they had problems</font>

1213
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:13,180
with o-rings and temperature now who do

1214
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think gave it to Katina who do you</font>

1215
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:19,480
think I've actually talked about that

1216
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:23,020
person was Sally Ride<font color="#CCCCCC"> who was on the</font>

1217
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:27,640
rogers Commission who had ties at NASA

1218
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:30,040
and with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties used it to pass the</font>

1219
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,259
information to Katina in a covert way he

1220
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,850
then took that information puppet

1221
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,280
mastered with Fineman and got the

1222
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:38,140
information out right she still worked

1223
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,030
at NASA she risked her career he still

1224
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,319
worked at NASA he risked his career how

1225
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,619
could they get the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where</font>

1226
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,069
they need

1227
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:46,749
to get it to where it needed to happen

1228
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:49,359
pretty brilliant and maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1229
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:50,859
you can do to pretty diabolical so you

1230
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,369
got to be thinking pretty diabolically

1231
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:56,200
it's pretty tough so for a successful

1232
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:57,549
technology reality must take presidents

1233
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,118
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> public relations for nature cannot</font>

1234
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:05,490
be fooled so I'm being asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop</font>

1235
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,490
which is fine do we have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

1236
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:12,308
for any of this do you understand a

1237
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:14,348
little bit more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing risk</font>

1238
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:16,119
about how it has to be framed and how we

1239
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,430
have to contextualize it it's incredibly

1240
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,410
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand as we go through</font>

1241
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,240
before I close I want to say one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1242
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:23,950
thing I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this man</font>

1243
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,919
Bobby billing babi guling was one of the

1245
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,519

1246
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,079
deaths of seven people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so personally</font>

1247
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,390
responsible that on the day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gun into Mission Control and I'm</font>

1251
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,460
have to kill everybody there that's how

1252
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,410
personally he took it after the launch

1253
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,539
he spiraled into a deep depression for

1254
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:51,368
30 years before he died this year in

1255
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:53,230
January he took it personally until some

1256
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:55,420
people at NASA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people who had</font>

00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:59,230
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> his story said it wasn't your</font>

1258
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">fault my message here is this you can be</font>

1259
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,599
emotionally attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

1260
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:06,038
can really really really bother you but

1261
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you have to understand is that</font>

1262
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:10,180
sometimes they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of your control</font>

1263
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,859
and if they're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your control deal</font>

1264
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,440
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as best you can don't</font>

1265
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:16,720
internalize them right Bobby bling died

1266
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,829
with a clear conscience but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

1267
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to walk away from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1268
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:21,599
with a bunch of negativity just because

1269
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,890
there were things you couldn't control

1270
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">right things out of your control they're</font>

1271
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,788
out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> control manage risk the best</font>

1272
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,578
you can understand your constraints

1273
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:33,339
that's the big lesson there's a bunch of

1274
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:34,960
references if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested I</font>

1275
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:37,720
recommend reading any Richard Feynman's
