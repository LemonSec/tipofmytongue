1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,729
without further ado our speakers today

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,318
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Candace human and Rock Stevens who</font>

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,179
are grad students in the university<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,320
maryland college park so guys take it

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">away thank you very much sincerely want</font>

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,740
to thank everyone for coming out to the

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,270
last talk of the day it means a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,770
know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of drinking between</font>

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,240
now and the pool party and dinner or not

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">what not so I really appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,720
the bottom line up front you know what

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,310
we hope you all can take away is

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,779
everyone in the audience right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,308
you use the skills knowledge and

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,640
expertise that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you currently</font>

16
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,620
have to make an impact on the world in

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,410
the news you see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things about</font>

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,930
bug bounty programs you know all the new

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,898
0 days are coming out getting a million

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day as a security</font>

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,788
practitioner what if you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,349
skills to save someone's life and you

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,090
know this we're gonna give some novel

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,219
examples of you know how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,530
your skills right now but you keep that

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,000
in the back of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind and maybe</font>

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,270
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something you learned can</font>

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,840
inspire you to carry on and make a

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference later on so all right so</font>

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
please ask questions at any point

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,280
because I know biology can be a little

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,740
scary um but anyways so what exactly is

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,189
computational biology well it all

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,770
started when people started sequencing

36
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,329
the genome right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of you</font>

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,908
have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the human genome</font>

38
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,158
projects and first you know it took

39
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,790
quite a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sequence a single</font>

40
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,799
genome and now you can do it in the span

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,610
of maybe one or two days or a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,100
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can sequence a lot of</font>

43
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things like not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> humans or</font>

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,809
animals but bacteria and plants and

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,009
there's thousands and thousands of

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">genomes out there that have been</font>

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,810
sequenced and that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,430
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and you know it's all well</font>

49
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:06,240
and good to do lab testing in a wet lab

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,819
with biologists but that costs money and

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,480
takes a lot of time where is

52
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:16,499
computers they're relatively cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,249
they're pretty fast so<font color="#E5E5E5"> running biology</font>

54
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:22,969
experiments in silico on computers

55
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:28,489
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps out the biologists</font>

56
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:32,450
so an example would be some researchers

57
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:35,430
we're looking at corn and there was an

58
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,060
invasive species that came into corn

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,769
crops and started filling out all of the

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,769
chlorine and this was a major problem

61
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:47,099
because corn is a big source of food so

62
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,620
what they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do was kill out the</font>

63
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,230
invasive species while still having the

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,560
corn available and not kill the corn

65
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,379
right so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this using systems</font>

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,030
biology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what systems</font>

67
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,429
biology does is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks at the</font>

68
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,620
metabolism so again when I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

69
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,069
started sequencing a genome so you have

70
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,290
a genome and that translates<font color="#E5E5E5"> into jeans</font>

71
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,179
and then you also have transcriptomics

72
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,448
which is the expression levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> genes</font>

73
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,810
so that basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you have</font>

74
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:22,530
blue eyes you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gene highly</font>

75
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,750
expressed and metabolism the genes that

76
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking at our genes that</font>

77
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">transcribe proteins which means they do</font>

78
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:36,530
physical chemical reactions inside of

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:39,419
your cell and those reactions turn into

80
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,340
metabolism which is which creates

81
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:46,409
various pathways right they're kind of

82
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:49,560
like logic gates and an extra added

83
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing onto the logic gates is you have</font>

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:58,590
rate of flow right rate of flow of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

85
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:00,649
protein right over a reaction so what

86
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,310
these people did was they took the

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,759
metabolic path or metabolic network of

88
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,340
corn and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the metabolic network of the</font>

89
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,069
invasive species and they tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock</font>

90
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,820
down genes so lower the gene expression

91
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:20,209
of various genes to see what would kill

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,209
the

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,880
select the plant of the in facial

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,770
species and not kill the corn so they

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,610
basically created a genetically modified

96
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:36,390
corn that was able to withstand the crop

97
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:42,330
killer and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still eat corn</font>

98
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">today for some of it so with that</font>

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,609
example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's hacking at a</font>

100
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,790
molecular level right you're exploiting

101
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,650
something changing the way it is

102
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:55,290
adapting its structure so that you can

103
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,669
achieve an outcome that's hacking so

104
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,500
what we're talking about are some

105
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,320
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that you may have in</font>

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">your daily lives that sort of correlate</font>

107
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,880
to the research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did together so</font>

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,200
this beautiful gift right here comes

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,690
from the National Institute of Health

110
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,340
and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at are the</font>

111
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,590
number of databases that are publicly

112
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,070
available with computational biology

113
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:22,669
information there's hundreds some of

114
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,290
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> federally funded programs</font>

115
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,120
they're freely available and some of

116
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,610
them are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know graduate students</font>

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,920
postdocs other researchers that just

118
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,250
made the data publicly available for a

119
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,170
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these instances the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

120
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,580
publicly available and unmaintained and

121
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,390
we'll come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to why this is an issue</font>

122
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,330
later but it for us the media concern

123
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:48,960
was let's say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a pet name for</font>

124
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,450
something if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very well</font>

125
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,909
you probably don't know why I referenced

126
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,140
this pet name frequently and you might

127
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,590
have a different pet name for your dog

128
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,570
it's vastly different but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we start</font>

129
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,890
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our dogs together I have</font>

130
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,510
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what you're talking about you</font>

131
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,849
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about and</font>

132
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this leads to disparate data sets where</font>

133
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,700
a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets are talking</font>

134
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,130
about the exact same thing but use

135
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,140
uncommon terminology so that when you

136
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,250
start to aggregate all this raw data

137
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,349
available there's no bridge between them

138
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,729
so

139
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:26,509
for many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that have ever dealt</font>

140
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:30,270
ever dealt with intrusion response

141
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:31,830
intrusion detection analysis this is a

142
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,180
common problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you right you know</font>

143
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,448
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a piece of malware</font>

144
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,490
that's on a host you want to know you

145
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">know all of the hard disk forensics</font>

146
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,569

148
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,060
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I start pulling the over the</font>

logs how did this intrusion enter the

151
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,500
network and you know start building a

know what happened within your damn

155
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:02,400
network we want to do the exact same

156
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,039
thing except looking at a disease

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,150
looking at a pathogen something that we

158
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to target so with that we want to</font>

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,549
all this freely available data you can

160
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,620
now ingest using these sort of hacker

167
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,440
we had to do it was actually building

168
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
our own custom web scrapers a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:13,109
actually go in and hack a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell so what</font>

182
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,400
we're going to do is do a real quick

hands-on look at what I'm talking about

184
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,859
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> then what we're going to do</font>

185
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,530
in this little hands-on is trimethoprim

186
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,710
it's an antibiotic drug that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

188
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:33,069
caused by E coli so we have a drug

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,539
trimethoprim

190
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:39,630
a pathogen ecoli and we're because we

191
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,830
know this antibiotic kills e.coli in

192
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,659
computational biology we expect it to

193
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,000
say yes this thing is now dead when you

<font color="#E5E5E5">treat the cell with a drug that's what</font>

214
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,890
two drugs trimethoprim and halothane we

215
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,740
know that trimethoprim should kill the

216
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,790
model and halothane not really sure

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,070
what's gonna happen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another</font>

218
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:53,560
drug so with when you have a cell and

219
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:59,620
you're focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a metabolic</font>

220
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:03,030
network inherently as all cells want to

221
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,760
thrive and reproduce spread the seed

222
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,380
reproductive be fruitful and in this

223
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,350
particular instance we're assuming that

224
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,110
all cells want to have optimal biomass

225
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,960
growth they want to achieve the largest

226
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,550
spread of that seed so what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

227
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,620
we're doing in this metabolic network is

228
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,199
targeting the biomass growth and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

229
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,950
find what drugs kill it effectively

230
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,930
denial servicing the cell

231
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,170
so we're to run the real quick script

232
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:38,199
and see how when we apply to different

233
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:40,270
drugs using<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock downs which are adding</font>

234
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,490
additional constraints to the model

235
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,949
saying that you know given<font color="#E5E5E5"> these targets</font>

236
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> electron methoprene we have two</font>

239
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:57,250
expressed within the model what happens

240
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,500
so according the results trimethoprim

241
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:04,450
results in<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero biomass growth which</font>

242
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,340
means it's dead but halothane has it

243
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,560
takes it from the original level of 0

244

245
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,180
you have drugs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't completely</font>

246
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,160
kill a pathogen it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note</font>

247
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,410
that you're actually breeding superbugs

248
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,510
at this point because you're killing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

249
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,880
weak ones and the sort of strong ones

250
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,319
survive and they breed so the ones that

251
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,750
are laughing at your job<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially are</font>

you cannot treat with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same drug</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our research that we talked about</font>

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,439
go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and download various things</font>

293
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you may be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in but you'll</font>

294
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,600
also note that there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing</font>

295
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,959
from the options<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you download</font>

296
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,990
things from there's no integrity check

297
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,730
there's no checksum there so there's

298
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,370
nothing to verify that this thing hasn't

299
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,160
been tainted hosted server side or

300
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,340
corrupted while downloading so the

301
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,459
foundation of your research has zero

302
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,680
integrity coming off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire moving</font>

303
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward which brings all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the research</font>

304
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,349
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce into question because you</font>

305
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,970
can't validate the validity of the

306
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,830
underlying data structures which is a

307
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:55,600
huge problem that people just are

308
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:59,740
considering right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so another problem</font>

309
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,220
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of biology stuff is</font>

310
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,070
uniquely identifiable right so my genome

311
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,820
is uniquely identified from rocks genome

312
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,650
but also our genomes are pretty similar

313
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,470
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just take out a little bit</font>

314
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,130
and it'll still be the human genome and

315
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,260
you won't know who to but some research

316
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,230
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is looking at the microbiome</font>

317
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,000
which is all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bacteria</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that lives</font>

318
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,760
inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gut or your mouth or</font>

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,540
wherever on your body your skin this is

320
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,880
extremely unique so my microbiome<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

321
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:42,520
completely different from any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yours</font>

322
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:46,300
and in the future with this lead towards

323
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,250
precision metal medicine you're going to

324
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,930
have your genome and your microbiome<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

325
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,000
file at your doctor's office

326
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,489
and if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> were to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that is completely uniquely identifiable

328
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:01,810
you can tell exactly who you're looking

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,899
at so and as of right now a lot of this

330
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">data is not being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken as sensitive</font>

331
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,089
because there aren't you know ways to

332
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,279
weaponize exploit this sort of data

333
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:13,510
presently but because people aren't

334
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,339
looking forward at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy and</font>

335
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">security considerations of this data</font>

336
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,649
resting unencrypted on someone's hard

337
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:27,880
drive that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying</font>

338
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bring light on so yeah yep our</font>

339
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:36,250
research looks at bacteria that have

340
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:40,390
become resistant to drugs so superbugs

341
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,760
right just a PSA this happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

342
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,310
do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish your course of antibiotics</font>

343
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,930
so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish your course of</font>

344
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,719
antibiotics<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> creating superbugs</font>

345
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,969
which is bad for everyone so finish your

346
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,620
course of antibiotics is what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

347
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:59,860
but some people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are</font>

348
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:05,040
bacteria that have been have become

349
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:07,570
resistant to a lot of antibiotics so the

350
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,750
pretty much the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this would</font>

351
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,730
be to create new drugs right but this is

352
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,400
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive and takes a</font>

353
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,459
really long time you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go</font>

354
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:21,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the genes that it took</font>

355
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,859
that would kill it which takes time then

356
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to test it in the lab and then</font>

357
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,860
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and tested on</font>

358
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,719
animals make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't feel</font>

359
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,810
anything and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to</font>

360
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,790
human testing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FDA has to approve</font>

361
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,339
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this just takes a really long</font>

362
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,839
time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its really expensive and major</font>

363
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,240
drug companies just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to do</font>

364
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,420
this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the problem with</font>

365
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,800
antibiotics is that bacteria are

366
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,140
eventually going to become resistant to

367
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,300
it so put they put all of this money

368
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,610
into it it lasts for a little bit it's

369
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,839
not an expensive drug so they don't get

370
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,829
much money for it and then it stops

371
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,070
working right so big drug companies are

372
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:01,150
not creating new drugs for antibiotics

373
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,690
so our solution

374
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:08,650
is to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> current drugs right there</font>

375
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:11,050
are hundreds of drugs out there that we

376
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,230
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side effects of and we know</font>

377
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:18,970
their toxicity levels and they're

378
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:21,670
available so what we wanted to do was to

379
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:27,569
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> current drugs that target human</font>

380
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:31,410
genes and then find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> orthologues in</font>

381
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:34,389
bacteria so<font color="#CCCCCC"> orthologues are basically</font>

382
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,150
genes that have the same function in two

383
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,890
different species and this happened at a

384
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:43,960
speciation event when we're talking

385
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:45,940
about evolution right so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

386
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,850
if it targets a gene in humans it should

387
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,180
target<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same functioning gene in the</font>

388
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,550
bacteria and what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is repurpose</font>

389
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,740
these drugs so say if we have a drug for

390
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:01,600
a cold or you know some sort of

391
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,880
arthritis drug and we say oh here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

392
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,659
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a new antibiotic right that</font>

393
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,450
will take less<font color="#E5E5E5"> time less money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

394
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,220
so what we did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started pulling</font>

395
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,170
together a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those databases those</font>

396
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,090
disparate data sets and we started

397
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,040
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> bridges together trying to find</font>

398
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,679
any way to stitch these data sets

399
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,629
together to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for us so</font>

400
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,970
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up with was an enormous</font>

401
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,320
list of existing and experimental drugs

402
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:33,010
and we have a human genome we have the

403
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,570
genome of e.coli and then we started

404
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">building bridges towards understanding</font>

405
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,689
what drugs would work against ecoli for

406
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:46,840
this particular example and what we

407
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:49,030
ended up making was a fully modular set

408
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:55,290
of code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would target any pathogen</font>

409
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:58,120
so tuberculosis strep staph infections

410
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,430
any sort of model that you load into

411
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,939
there with the similar data you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can now</font>

412
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:06,610
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> our methodology to check what drugs</font>

413
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,030
would be viable against this target

414
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:13,520
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that we did was we</font>

415
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,379
knew trimethoprim worked and so we we

416
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,629
looked for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our data set and we</font>

417
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,850
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it were cool and we also came up</font>

418
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,450
with several other viable candidates

419
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,629
that would be used to treat resistant

420
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,210
eco i but as you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting seeing a</font>

421
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:33,200
lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> results pop up they're</font>

422
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:36,710
targeting the same genes be 28 27 you'll

423
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,230
see as a common thread as what drugs are

424
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:43,130
commenting are targeting what gene

425
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">within e-coli so given that trimethoprim</font>

426
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,010
this is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its targets and it's now</font>

427
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:52,790
resistant to this particular drug

428
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:55,460
targeting the same exact the same exact

429
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,920
gene is madness right because you're

430
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same exact effect so</font>

431
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,510
what we wanted to do was we ended up

432
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,340
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a list of 12 candidate</font>

433
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,700
drugs that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be viable alternatives</font>

434
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,530
to traditional antibiotics but we also

435
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,510
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know are there any other</font>

436
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,910
combinations of drugs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would work</font>

437
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,220
and so essentially we took the same

438
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,720
exact list and started performing double

439
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,480
knock downs of their targets seeing what

440
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">would actually work our research showed</font>

441
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,170
that there are 0 viable alternatives for

442
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:34,420
e.coli given this methodology of double

443
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,610
drug knockdowns eliminating this list

444
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,650
there were some drugs that had a

445
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,530
dampening effect on the metabolic rate

446
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,470
which means yes in a viable alternative

447
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:49,790
is going to create super bugs and that's

448
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,980
exactly what we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want so this is</font>

449
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">our candidate list and some of the</font>

450
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,120
things that these drugs were used for

451
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,650
largely we're treating cancer patients

452
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,379
chemotherapy there were some other

453
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,420
experimental drugs in there one for

454
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,110
rheumatoid arthritis multiple school of

455
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,780
sclerosis what if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

456
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,209
if you have a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> disease that</font>

457
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,450
your body is resistant to and it's now a

458
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,340
matter of life and death

459
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:22,820
you're going to be more willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

460
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:27,080
these chemotherapy style drugs to save

461
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:30,710
the patient and here's some life advice

462
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:35,840
for you whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing you want</font>

463
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,800
to save that<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient right so if you</font>

464
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,360
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular patient on the</font>

465
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">deathbed and you have something with</font>

466
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,040
known toxicity levels you know the side

467
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,660
effects you believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can save</font>

468
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,110
the patient with this alternative drug

469
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,150
despite how immunosuppressive it is the

470
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,330
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the patient if it can bring</font>

471
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that person back to life spoiler alert</font>

472
00:21:52,330 --> 00:22:00,530
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably something you don't want</font>

473
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take so moving forward we've talked</font>

474
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,250
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple ways that you can use</font>

475
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:07,610
skill sets you have right now to help

476
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,660
find alternative drugs to resistant

477
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,320
diseases well then the day you need the

478
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,910
understand the fundamental understanding

479
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,550
of biology to make this sort of thing

480
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,310
happen one of these candidate drugs is

481
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,100
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a disinfectant so a traditional</font>

00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">way of inducing you know treating</font>

483
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,689
internal issues with a disinfectant is

484
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,430
drinking a bottle disinfectant which in

485
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,520
turn would probably kill the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool i</font>

486
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:35,450
right and the patient breaking the

487
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,920
previous life advice rule so while we

488
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,900
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use our various</font>

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,700
find viable alternatives some of them

491
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:48,170
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not work because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mode</font>

492
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:50,420
of treatment so if any of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

493
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,920
interested in learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about the</font>

fundamentals<font color="#CCCCCC"> of biology there are some</font>

495
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,060
ways that you can do that if you're like

496
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:01,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and you need structure in your life</font>

497
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:05,270
there are several extremely well

polished free courses available MIT

499
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,320

familiar with Coursera or EDX they also

502
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,030
have amazingly well polished products

503
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,860
available for free that'd take you

504
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,030
through an entire semester's course at

your own pace

506
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,690
if you like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit less structure</font>

507
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,390
and you like CTFs or coding competitions

508
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,120
there's websites like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rosalind that will</font>

509
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,240
be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with a project euler</font>

510
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,739
other websites like that that teach you

511
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
mathematics this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example like</font>

512
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,640
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to solve</font>

513
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,870
computational biology problems it's not

514
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to tell you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

515
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it you build the scripts that do it</font>

516
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:52,110
and it's more of a hands-on approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

517
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning so in recap we've gone through</font>

518
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,409
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> methodologies that I was</font>

519
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,380
able to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my emphasis background</font>

520
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:03,420
to help our research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and computational</font>

521
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:07,580
biology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just also thank the people</font>

522
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:10,050
who made this trip possible for us and

523
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,490
we're also open to any questions that

524
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:16,580
you might have right now about our

525
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,580
research please

526
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,270
sure

527
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:55,080
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the funding</font>

528
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,250
comes from the federal government so

529
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,610
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of regulation that goes</font>

530
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:06,150
on as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some mad scientist</font>

531
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:10,320
weaponize in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and with all the data</font>

532
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,330
freely available publicly then there's

533
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing to say that you can come up with</font>

534
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,070
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your own and do your own private</font>

535
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,260
tests so yeah also you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

536
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:22,289
biologist<font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do the actual</font>

537
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,940
experiments so because you know it's all

538
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:27,450
well and good to do things in silico but

539
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,490
it's not perfect you still need the wet

540
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:32,309
lab tests when you've narrowed down your

541
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,779
search yeah all the metabolic models and

542
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:36,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets that we have they're all</font>

543
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,360
imperfect it's a representation of our

544
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,640
best guess at what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on through</font>

545
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">its right i mean science right but it</font>

546
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,659
also is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a best guess at what's going on</font>

547
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:51,950
in a particular moment given a reaction

548
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:51,950
going on please

549
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,410
yep

550
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,790
what stop

551
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
hmm

552
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,620
right so that's the in silico process of

553
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,450
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done you know you going</font>

554
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">through with embedded block model you</font>

555
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,500
can enumerate every single gene and you

556
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,510
can perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> single and double knockdown</font>

557
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,299
of these genes to find single or double

558
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,040
pairs that result in lethality if you

559
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,590
want to kill something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

560
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:41,450
synthetic lethality is a well discovered

561
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,610
arming a well-researched area and doing

562
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:48,020
that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find new or to make</font>

563
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:50,750
new drugs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> target that is being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

564
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">but as we mentioned earlier it's a very</font>

565
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,710
lengthy process very expensive process

566
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,740
and if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something available</font>

567
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,520
that's already approved right now our

568
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:04,730
pitch is why not use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah absolutely</font>

569
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,410
yep and then you know with big data are

570
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,780
with a big farm it's always the return

571
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,780
on investment at that particular point

572
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,780
so

573
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:22,149
I for me particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've been</font>

574
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing if a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sex since I was like a little</font>

575
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:27,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">kid so it's something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm passionate</font>

576
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,289
about but we actually took a class

577
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,019
together on metabolic networks and

578
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,049
that's what sort of kicked this research

579
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:37,360
forward yep combined our skills I guess

580
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:40,029
for ya she works in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition of</font>

581
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,998
biology lab full time and I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

582
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:45,669
researcher at Maryland so yeah it was

583
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:48,190
fun working together and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

584
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:56,249
some cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hopefully get a</font>

585
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:56,249
publication out of it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so please</font>

586
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,759
yeah I think I my recommendation would

587
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,350
be doing some of the fundamentals that

588
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,700
we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the biology getting back</font>

589
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,689
into I know you have extensive

590
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,499
experience but computational biology

591
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,389
even though the different libraries that

592
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:50,989
are available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you or your brand new</font>

593
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:55,309
largely so doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then for</font>

594
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:56,720
collaboration you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> with UCSD in</font>

595
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:57,950
Maryland I'm there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of huge</font>

596
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,330
labs that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always looking for</font>

597
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">collaborative partners and you know with</font>

598
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,350
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> freely available data you know</font>

599
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,279
if you set up your own experiments and

600
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,859
you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey I think I might have</font>

601
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,480
this interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> binding and sharing it</font>

602
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:14,509
published publishing it you know you

603
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,279
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other biological researchers</font>

604
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:17,989
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't when they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick that up right I</font>

605
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,509
mean there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of papers that are</font>

606
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:22,249
coming out right now that combine these

607
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,080
two fields so I mean even reading them

608
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:27,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I can</font>

609
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,178
change something like this oh that's a

610
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,619
there's tons of stuff out there there

611
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:39,320
ebbie is like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really low hanging</font>

612
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:43,220
fruit that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the</font>

613
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,439
particular example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> corn we know the</font>

614
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,009
individual that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was asked to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help with</font>

615
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,059
it and he was offered several millions

616
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:55,940
of dollars to help do that project and

617
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:58,340
he didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want to pursue</font>

618
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,950
other things but that project went

619
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,918
forward and now they have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know crop</font>

620
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:07,549
resistant core our weed killer resistant

621
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,200
corn essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can guess what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

622
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,720
of company would have invested in that

623
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,070
but yeah

624
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,030
there's money to be had in it with like

625
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,030
she said<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-hanging fruit</font>

626
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,100
sure

627
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:49,749
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so yeah I mean there's</font>

628
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:54,320
there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big effort to create</font>

629
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:58,639
these communities all over the place so

630
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:01,820
I know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are doing that</font>

631
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:04,789
right now or attempting to so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

632
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,499
their community spaces that are being

633
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:10,220
created for this kind of collaboration

634
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:12,799
yeah so if you want to contact us we can

635
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,539
try to find more precise answers for you

636
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,539
other than saying yes it's being done

637
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:25,449
cool any other questions I thank you all

638
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,450
for coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really appreciate</font>
