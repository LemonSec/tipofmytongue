00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about my BFF</font>

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,450
today unfortunately my BFF wasn't able

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,889
to be here if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to come up</font>

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:18,299
i'll talk about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next half</font>

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:21,479
hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh how about that no no no my BFF</font>

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,980
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lie wrote and it's kind of sad but</font>

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,720
over the last six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so i've</font>

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,380
probably spent more time with this tool

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,259
than I have with my actual BFF but I

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the information</font>

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:41,820
security industry right so like I like

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">the announced I'm Kirk I'm a husband I'm</font>

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,629
of course probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everybody else</font>

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">in here I'm a security consultant for</font>

17
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,329
rapid seven doing penetration testing I

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,230
created a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:05,330

20
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:07,710
popular if you will it's a android

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,200
application file system analysis tool

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,649
for non rooted devices so you can

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,330
actually access the file system and and

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,250
it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> for showing risk to customers</font>

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,460
but it's also great for<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving your wife</font>

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,330
unlimited lives and candy crush actually

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,009
the reason I wrote it she stopped

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,470
playing pretty quickly after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

31
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,700

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">community site for rapid seven so you</font>

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,320
can check that out if you want so today

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,479
we're going to talk about different

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication methods I'll start off</font>

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,670
there this is kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more basic</font>

37
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,079
stuff you'll see the kittens and at

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,909
least one dog in there I didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,219
offend either side I don't want to

40
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,299
choose a side on the kitten<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs. puppy</font>

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:06,658
debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I am a dog person more</font>

42
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,239
well then well then go into techniques

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,709
for attacking authentication

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,740
specifically passwords that's why we're

45
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,540
here

46
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,960
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about a web</font>

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,359
application log informs my BFF is a tool

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,670
for attacking login against web

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,060
applications currently it will be

50
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,530
expanded to other protocols as well

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,480
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about kind of tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

52
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,240
out there for web application testing

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,739
and guessing their strengths<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,040
weaknesses and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about my</font>

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,890
BFF will get in too deep into that how

56
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,760
that works the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> modules what</font>

57
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,190
you can do to add into it if you want

58
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,480
I'll do a quick demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> on its</font>

59
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,329
functionality and then we'll talk about

60
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,190
mitigations for these kinds of attacks

61
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,940
since you know the we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

62
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,770
able to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> against those so</font>

63
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,050
different authentication techniques

64
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,550
first one up biometric you know it's

65
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that you are you have</font>

66
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,300
fingerprints retinal scans voice

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,090
recognition facial<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognition</font>

68
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,740
biometrics kind of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years ago I</font>

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,950
was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a company we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

70
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,220
implement biometrics it was just

71
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,859
technology wasn't as good then it was

72
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">also very cost prohibitive but something</font>

73
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,120
changed in the last two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so</font>

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,820
anybody know what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's kind of</font>

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,000
bringing biometrics to mainstream that's

76
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,370
right iphone android phones if you have

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,350
one within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years most</font>

78
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,610
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a fingerprint reader mine</font>

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't it's old but biometrics is great</font>

80
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,600
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and</font>

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,730
we're seeing more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just logging into</font>

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,650
your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> with biometrics now a lot of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bank apps and stuff are starting to</font>

84
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,270
implement those biometrics which is

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,160
great this cat is actually using

86
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">biometrics to log into its computer</font>

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,170
right here if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't know cats have</font>

88
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,480
a unique forehead print it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

89
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a zebra and they can authenticate</font>

90
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:10,089
that way that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally made up let's</font>

91
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,910
get it around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing we have is</font>

92
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,630
a pin a personal identification number

93
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,850
it's usually four digits could be longer

94
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,339
we use the plugin phones use it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font>

95
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">in when you want to get money from the</font>

96
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,940
ATM you have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your PIN don't do</font>

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that here</font>

98
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:33,610
trust me<font color="#CCCCCC"> atms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not with all of you people</font>

99
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:36,520
around but pin numbers are great<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in</font>

100
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,680
to your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it you could also use</font>

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,510
pins as a second factor if you think

102
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,850
about it right your<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSA tokens your</font>

103
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,730
google authenticator essentially that's

104
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,340
a pin it's a unique ID that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and</font>

105
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,430
that's what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> pins are best for</font>

106
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,510
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the second factor not a</font>

107
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,650
primary it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for numbers the only about</font>

108
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:02,020
ten thousand possibilities and it's

109
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,359
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to brute force and figure</font>

110
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,820
out and lastly we have usernames and

111
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,820
passwords by far the most common you use

112
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,719
a plug-in everything computer your bank

113
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,400
account different web applications

114
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,110
different protocols we use it everywhere

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:26,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usernames are easy to get right</font>

116
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:30,760
how do we get usernames anybody which is

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,890
all users we just ask the users we we

118
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,560
could scrape<font color="#CCCCCC"> LinkedIn for the data I</font>

119
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,419
find more and more on tests that

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,419
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are putting their entire</font>

121
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,419
directory structure all the employees on

122
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,789
their websites not sure why but they

123
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,560
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a risk and that's fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

124
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:52,570
that's what their decision was but it

125
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,700
makes my job very easy and in the worst

126
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,620
case scenario when it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find we</font>

127
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,810
just use census data run<font color="#E5E5E5"> against some</font>

128
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,510
kind of timing attack against some kind

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,910
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> service and and gain a bunch of</font>

130
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,719
usernames passwords become a little

131
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,790
harder realistically people are pretty

132
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,200
predictable with their passwords right

133
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,740
so those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually pretty easy to</font>

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,120
guess but that's we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple</font>

135
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what those</font>

136
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,460
passwords are once we have usernames

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,900
first is brute force like this kitten it

138
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,580
used brute force<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get through this</font>

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,270
wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kept pounding in one spot</font>

140
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,250
until it got through brute force is as

141
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:36,159
many passwords as we can throw at an

142
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:38,880
account until we get in simple password

143
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,500
spraying here's the puppy

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,409
password spraying is kind of the inverse

145
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,970
of brute forcing right we're instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

146
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,550
brute forcing a password against the

147
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,790
user we're brute forcing users against a

148
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,560
password i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try thousands of</font>

149
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,540
usernames against one password and

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,200
likely i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in and that's</font>

151
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:03,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do one major thing which is</font>

152
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,840
prevent account lockout and to

153
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:09,700
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> account lockout we'll</font>

154
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,729
look at online versus offline online any

155
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:16,360
service that's that's authenticating and

156
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,280
checking with the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>

157
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,950
they usually have a account lockout

158
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,570
policy and so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use password</font>

159
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,740
spraying we don't want to lock out

160
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,030
accounts that's going to cause<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

161
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,320
denial of service and we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

162
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">get in we want to get in right so if</font>

163
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,870
we're an online service such as a web

164
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,390
application we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use password</font>

165
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,520
spraying on that where's offline there's

166
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,700
no risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> if account lockout but we need</font>

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,940
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> for offline guessing anybody</font>

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,210
know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hashes right so how do</font>

169
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get hashes numerous ways but once we</font>

170
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,159
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hash we can use brute force</font>

171
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,780
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's dictionary attack or pure</font>

172
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,030
brute force trying every single

173
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,510
combination possible there's some tools

174
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:02,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to try those things like I</font>

175
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,320
said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on web</font>

176
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,299
applications and so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> online so</font>

177
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,830
we'll focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spring for the</font>

178
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,530
most part web application log in forms

179
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,570
are very straightforward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple they</font>

180
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,369
all are common they all have three

181
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,370
common components you have your username

182
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,350
your password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a submit button</font>

183
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,130
essentially all<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is the username</font>

184
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,260
field the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password field they could</font>

185
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,080
change names they can be completely

186
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:35,740
whatever unique whatever they want but

187
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,320
this is essentially what a web<font color="#E5E5E5"> app blog</font>

188
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,060
and forum looks like this is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

189
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,350
created in probably 30 seconds so the

190
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,420
submit button is going to take whatever

191
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:50,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the username the password as a</font>

192
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,790
payload and submit it to the form to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,380
page it's going to

194
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,089
and that'll do a check on the database

195
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,740
and return a valid or invalid response

196
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,280
so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tools to check on</font>

197
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,930
this first up is burp suite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly</font>

198
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,470
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> burp suite if you don't have</font>

199
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it's very manual that's</font>

200
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,550
that's the only problem with Burke sweet

201
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,170
I need to review the traffic I need to

202
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,390
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the username field is</font>

203
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,550
what the password field is and then once

204
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,590
I run intruder now I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and</font>

205
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at what's an invalid versus a valid</font>

206
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,380
response that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one offs but if</font>

207
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,689
you're doing that test after test after

208
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,750
test almost different or the same web

209
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:36,640
apps it comes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a pain so</font>

210
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,610
there are scripts written different

211
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,780
languages but these scripts are specific

212
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,550
to one<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of application right there</font>

213
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,900
may be a citrix portal that you're

214
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,270
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can run a</font>

215
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,920
script and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll tell you if it's valid</font>

216
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:56,290
or invalid but if that citrix portal

217
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,740
changes which there's multiple different

218
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,469
versions and every couple years citrix

219
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,600
seems to change all their code well now

220
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need a new script and it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a pain</font>

221
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,560
so so i created my BFF what is my BFF

222
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,680
it's a brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

223
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,040
modular<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can just easily add new</font>

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,250
modules for different web applications

225
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,650
or even different protocols it's

226
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,530
intelligent what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by that is I</font>

227
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,689
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to pick out and</font>

228
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,819
choose what the username field is what

229
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,290
the password field is what the valid

230
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,690
response is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

231
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,819
all that in I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to figure out</font>

232
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,790
what kind of application is pointing out

233
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,030
a URL find out what what application is

234
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,520
called the right module and and just

235
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,500
give me the information and it goes

236
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,470
beyond just brute-forcing and that's

237
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,100
kind of the secret sauce on this and

238
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,310
I'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that more in a little bit</font>

239
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:00,000
currently we have about five modules

240
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:03,518
there's some of them up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,769
so for each module first we're going to

242
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,830
fingerprint we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find out what</font>

243
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:11,100
kind of application this is this could

244
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,320
be many different ways it could be a URL

245
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,200
it could be a string within the body<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

246
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,140
the response from that page it could be

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,110
a cookie value anything that separates

248
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that application or that protocol apart</font>

249
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">from others will fingerprint off and</font>

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,829
then we'll call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a module and in the</font>

251
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,010
module first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the payload like I</font>

252
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,870
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> user name password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

253
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,700
different it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be username it could</font>

254
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,470
be user underscore name it could be J

255
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,200
underscore username it could be user dot

256
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,360
name the user could be something totally

257
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,649
different so we create that payload and

258
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,290
then once we do that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font>

259
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,980
connect test and this is where scripts

260
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,390
at this point stop we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell</font>

261
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,190
you if it's valid or invalid and that's

262
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">great but I want more and so lastly</font>

263
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,070
we're going to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool with</font>

264
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,020
that explain that about six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

265
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,649
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create this tool</font>

266
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:15,089
I was on an external engagement for

267
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,800
customer and do my testing and

268
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,680
enumerated about three or four thousand

269
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">usernames off of Foix they had on one of</font>

270
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,479
their apps and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed to do</font>

271
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,750
password guessing right so I ran through

272
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,880
with my favorite password season and

273
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:35,220
year right so at the time it was spring

274
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,220
2016 how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that password</font>

275
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,949
hopefully not but it's a very very very

276
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:48,190
common password that we see everywhere

277
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:51,670
so I have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 valid accounts at</font>

278
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,470
this point after using that and they

279
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,709
have a citrix portal I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Citrix</font>

280
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,839
because I can escape it pretty easily

281
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,779
and once I escape<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Citrix sandbox now</font>

282
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,730
I have internal access and get to you

283
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,730
know destroy the internal network

284
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,990
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried with the first account and</font>

285
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,939
the response that from the page was

286
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:18,190
there's no applications assigned to this

287
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:21,130
user so all right try another one try

288
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,620
the second one no valid applications

289
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,910
assigned to this user third one what do

290
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,160
you think that was no valid a fourth

291
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,860
fifth sixth I got to the seventh or

292
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,819
eighth and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said this is ridiculous</font>

293
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,950
there's got to be a better way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

294
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so ended up scripting out the whole</font>

295
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,700
thing ran through all 15 and every

296
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,770
single one didn't have any applications

297
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,490
so at this point I'm like this kind of

298
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:51,250
sucks but now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a script run that</font>

299
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,040
script and using my second-favorite

300
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,610
password company name<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two three four</font>

301
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,439
and ended up getting three or four with

302
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,930
that and one of them actually had

303
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,150
applications so get in escape a Citrix

304
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,489
environment get internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> access end up</font>

305
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,579
owning the entire domain they had

306
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,630
multiple domains and took all that over

307
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,280
so it was very successful in my my part

308
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,620
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i mean by going beyond</font>

309
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,020
so each module is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

310
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,940
different and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on</font>

311
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the module on the web application or on</font>

312
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:33,130
the protocol for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Outlook Web Access</font>

313
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,480
in owa and office 365 we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

314
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">parse the email we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look for</font>

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,110
sensitive information we're going to

316
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,900
print that out for you we're also going

317
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,110
to pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all the contacts and save</font>

318
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,680
that off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> citrix we list those</font>

319
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,680
apps out so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell if it's a</font>

320
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,900
internet explorer browser a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

321
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,130
application or a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows desktop I</font>

322
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,829
can decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> which one I want to attack</font>

323
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,710
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something cool before</font>

324
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:05,440
the authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> often juniper has</font>

325
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,050
multi-factor enabled but we can usually

326
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,930
bypass that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how its set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

327
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we'll attempt that bypass we'll see</font>

328
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it works and if it does then we'll do</font>

329
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,420
our brute forcing against that and so

330
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,430
each modules like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

331
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font>

332
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:35,180
so so we'll go into a quick demo just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

333
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of that it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be if it's a</font>

334
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,680
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> small I can zoom in on it for you</font>

335
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,250
it but to start off we're going to just

336
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:47,140
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python my BFF we're going to pass it</font>

337
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:49,190
the host now the host has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to include the</font>

338
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:54,500
protocol that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

339
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:57,290
this case HD PS and the IP or the host

340
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,170
name that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to attack the</font>

341
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:03,410
capital use for a user list and so this

342
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:06,199
list has a few users and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> P lowercase</font>

343
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:10,399
P is for a single password again one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

344
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:13,610
my favorite passwords to try this this

345
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,860
particular app actually failed it's a

346
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:20,510
small business server and so if you

347
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know small business servers when</font>

348
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage it</font>

349
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:28,130
redirects you to a virtual host which is

350
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,839
remote remote web workplace where you

351
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,839
can remote control the system's inside

352
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:40,040
for the for this I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tacko debut a</font>

353
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:43,700
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is / owa so we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on</font>

354
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,599
this clear this out we will run this

355
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:51,050
using a V host option the<font color="#E5E5E5"> V host option</font>

356
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,470
is going to we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add in the</font>

357
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,459
owa so we can specify that specific

358
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:01,370
hosts and after we run this will see

359
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:04,849
that it finds that it's an office 365 or

360
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:07,520
owa server and then it tries the

361
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:11,300
password guessing we'll find that user

362
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,490
three was successful with spring 2016 we

363
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,399
then search for sensitive emails looking

364
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,280
for key words such as password in there

365
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,199
we find that there's some password helps

366
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,309
and from emails from the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> admin</font>

367
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,339
and it's kind of sad that the domain

368
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:31,129
admin actually has the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password so</font>

369
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,290
good job there

370
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,030
and you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice at the bottom we we</font>

371
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:39,920
take any<font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a</font>

372
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:42,920
file under temp and then contacts dash

373
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,050
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user name and it splits</font>

374
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,700
that out so now we can use this

375
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:56,180
information to do other attacks such as

376
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:59,450
such<font color="#CCCCCC"> as phishing attacks or just trying</font>

377
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,430
to email through that or more password

378
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:06,670
guests and things like that now the

379
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:10,100
second module<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year i found a</font>

380
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:13,700
zero-day in a HP<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitescope application</font>

381
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,790
site scope is a application<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows</font>

382
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:21,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to monitor your system servers</font>

383
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:24,980
network from<font color="#E5E5E5"> loose web console and so</font>

384
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:30,080
they had a exploit in that and so this

385
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:32,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the module for that so we run my BFF</font>

386
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,929
again this time the host is actually is

387
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:41,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service is running a port 8080 so</font>

388
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:44,540
once we put in the URL we add the port

389
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:49,700
and it's not a separate option it's all

390
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:52,040
within that hosts the module is going to

391
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,310
call a Metasploit module that will then

392
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,280
exploit and get us a shell through this

393
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:01,970
DNS tool look up where we have command

394
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,830
execution and in this case we're going

395
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,850
to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowercase u we're going to try</font>

396
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,879
one user and one password admin and

397
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,879
password

398
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,370
and we'll run this and we'll see it

399
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,940
successful it's going to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

400
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:30,008
Metasploit module it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

401
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:35,499
through once it loads up that our

402
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:37,720
meterpreter shell and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run get you</font>

403
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">ID to see who it's running as and we see</font>

404
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">its anti-authority system which is which</font>

405
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:45,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">is great now we have access to go beyond</font>

406
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,960
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

407
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,030
so the my BFF is is going to be

408
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,360
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> today right after this</font>

409
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,389
presentation it'll be located on the

410
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">moose dojo github page so go check that</font>

411
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:10,360
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be adding more modules as I go</font>

412
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:16,280
currently we have I have plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

413
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:23,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">WordPress cisco VPN s and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple other</font>

415
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,440
and other protocols as well so a lot of

416
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,000
cool things coming and each one of them

417
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,770
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different right</font>

418
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,740
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole point of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

the username password is correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have ideas let me know I'd love to talk</font>

429
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:05,330
it the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

430
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,490
detection is key<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations I can't</font>

431
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,710
detect these kinds of attacks or attacks

432
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,180
against them are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail and so if</font>

433
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can put in place brute force</font>

434
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,670
detection and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a password</font>

435
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,890
spraying or brute forcing against

436
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,050
accounts within if it's a Windows domain

437
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,940
it's all eat it's easy it's all built in

438
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:28,280
you can just enable that kind of this

439
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:31,610
kind of thresholds in that monitoring so

440
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,530
it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there second is</font>

441
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,169
multi-factor authentication as long as

442
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,470
you're implementing it correctly and

443
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:44,240
there's not a bypass like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> juniper</font>

444
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:47,840
often has this drastically reduces my

445
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,630
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack your system I need</font>

446
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,070
that second factor now so now i need to

447
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,350
social engineer an employee or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to</font>

448
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,570
some other way gain access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

449
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,439
second factor

450
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:09,889
and then lastly strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass phrases are</font>

451
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,540
key if your passwords long complex I'm

452
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,580
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to guess it easily</font>

453
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm not wanting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove force to</font>

454
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:22,820
lock out your account so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">make things much harder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me so that's</font>

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:28,399
everything this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my contact</font>

462
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:56,030
integrated with this is it just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

463
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:58,280
or yep so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit modules it's</font>

just the one is the HP site scope that

465
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:05,480
I've written it be easy to add as

466
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,180
modules go but yeah but that's the only

467
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">one we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have currently do you have like</font>

468
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:16,970
an optional switch to specify like an RC

469
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:19,490
file I don't currently writes out the RC

470
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,460
file and then calls that are C file to

471
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:27,280
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything those are things that</font>

472
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:29,540
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth looking into an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> additive</font>

473
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move on to next</font>
