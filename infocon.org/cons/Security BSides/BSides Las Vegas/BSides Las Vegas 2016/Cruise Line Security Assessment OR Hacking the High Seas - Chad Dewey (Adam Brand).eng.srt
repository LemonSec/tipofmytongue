information with them and only a couple

of respondents so far right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

59
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,650
them are pretty probably thinking oh

60
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,850
 or something anyway so I viously

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,120
done a lot of cruising over the years

62
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,160
starting in may 2005 and had a little

63

<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of a hiatus and then 2011 I ramp to</font>

of the presentation before the cruise

66
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,359
hooking yourself up with goodies and

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
little perks here and there during the

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cruise kind of taking a little look at</font>

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,640
their Wi-Fi and the physical security of

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,170
the ship and then after the cruise we're

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,609
probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting stuff is</font>

72
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,440
internet connectivity system

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,160

card and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money and everything</font>

81
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,160
is supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good to go some of</font>

82
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:30,739
these cruise lines do not have good

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,810
sanitization of the the information

84
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:36,410
that's given to them for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

85
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:41,239
my profile on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the go into the</font>

86
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,880
cruise ships here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the things</font>

87
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,860
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your account</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok for</font>

example update missing information such

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,940
as ship or dates that you traveled in

90
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:54,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past in case they might have missed</font>

91
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,570
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok now again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is my real</font>

92
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,980
profile I blacked out some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff</font>

93
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,510
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you've cruise before</font>

94
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,570
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you might be able to guess</font>

95
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,459
who this is but anyway so this according

96
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,410
to this it shows that I've cruised on

97
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,720
seven different cruises each of them a

98
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven-day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cruise it looks like I've done</font>

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,269
seven cruises not really I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

100
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,989
actually cruised four times with this

101
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:20,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer this particular cruise line and</font>

102
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:24,530
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four real ones okay I</font>

103
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:29,719
never crew well I did cruise in 2011

104
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:34,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but only one time ok now the</font>

105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,700
purpose of showing you this is you get

106
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,200
perks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay each cruise line has its own</font>

107
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,360
little tier system you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with</font>

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,150
blue maybe go to gold platinum so on and

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,130
so forth with these perks you get I

110
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,440
don't know free Wi-Fi you know so you

111
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,210
get internet connection on the ship

112
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,740
sometimes they give you other perks like

113
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,419
have a drink with a captain that sort of

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,190
thing some of them even give you tours

115
00:04:53,419 --> 00:05:01,490
of the ship<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as far as starting</font>

116
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,419
up in the signing up for your cruises

117
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,820
here again there's a double there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

118
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,180
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to go a little bit further</font>

119
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,040
well let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never cruised in 2009</font>

120
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,450
so i can see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe they're</font>

121
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,710
doubling it up because i actually did

122
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,810
cruise then well they didn't check to

123
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,200
see if I crypt check there if I cruised

124
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,690
in 2009 I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cruise in</font>

125
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,830
2005 on this particular ship the

126
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:33,020
Caribbean ship but I did not cruise on

127
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:36,560
the crown ship why well because it was

128
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,219
still being built okay it didn't have

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,520
its maiden voyage until June in 2006 ok

130
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,039
so again they didn't check anything not

131
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,190
a whole lot of harm is done here you

132
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,840
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get my crew status elevated</font>

133
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,789
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay other perks on some of</font>

134
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,140
these cruise ships beforehand before the

135
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:02,270
the cruise you can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them you've had</font>

know thanking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for cruising without</font>

149
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,100
so on and so forth I've had

150
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:43,010
anniversaries in December februari March

151
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:46,340
and May all right where's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottle of</font>

152
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:49,909
wine<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so now we're on the cruise</font>

153
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,010
so this is during the cruise so you

154
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,270
definitely want to be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

155
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless security ok this is this is a</font>

156
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,180
slowly gotten better over time the first

157
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:05,750
cruise I went on in 2005 was protected

158
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,190
with WEP encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's 2005</font>

159
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,650
things could've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

160
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,780
anyway so internet access on these

161
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,429
cruise ships can be very expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

162
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,150
twenty-five dollars a day on the last

163
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,680
cruise that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went on okay that's that's</font>

164
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,299
ridiculous and the internet is not all

165
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,280
that fast either<font color="#E5E5E5"> a satellite internet ok</font>

166
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,500
so anyway moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> right along here so y 5</font>

167
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,090
is expensive if you start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

168
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,460
and poking and prodding at the Wi-Fi

169
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,989
you'll notice that if you're in the room

170
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,830
there's not a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic down</font>

171
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,480
there you're in the belly of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beast</font>

172
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,789
so you know if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

173
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,780
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around you're going to want to</font>

174
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:46,430
look at a more active place like by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

175
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,320
pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really didn't have a lot</font>

176
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,380
of luck I was on<font color="#CCCCCC"> vacation ok I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

177
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,760
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sit there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

178
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,350
do all sorts of stuff just try and get

179
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,070
free Wi-Fi because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways of</font>

180
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,020
doing that if I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to here in a second</font>

181
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,400
okay now remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that platinum status</font>

182
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,359
earned you some free Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

183
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,219
fortunately you don't necessarily have

184
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,610
to be platinum in order to gain free

185
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,950
Wi-Fi how well some of these cruise

186
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,260
ships give away some personal

187
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,539
information by posting your information

188
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,849
outside of your cabin so you have a

189
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,460
cabin number first<font color="#E5E5E5"> name last name and</font>

190
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,650
one all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cruise ships are nice enough</font>

191
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,349
to say oh you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gold member you're a</font>

192
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,489
platinum member all that's required and

193
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,990
you get a 153 minutes on one

194
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,169
the cruise line in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to get those</font>

195
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,690
153 minutes what do you have to know

196
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,799
first name last name cabin number and

197
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,380
you have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're you know</font>

198
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,990
your platinum of course so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

199
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:49,140
technically pilfer somebody else's free

200
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,760
why five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font>

201
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">encryptions gotten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better so on and so</font>

202
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,130
forth okay so other physical security

203
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,660
issues safe was they all have safes in

204
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,510
the room some<font color="#E5E5E5"> are numerical some of them</font>

205
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,010
use a magnetic strip card the magnetic

206
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,300
strip card was an odd one because they

207
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,480
said you should either use a credit card

208
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,459
or your driver's license no you don't

209
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,140
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that I used I think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used a</font>

210
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,829
gift card to longhorns or something like

211
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,660
that but uh anyway so staff doors are

212
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,000
almost never locked some had no locks

213
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,730
and as you see in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide some</font>

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,580
even worse doors the ship internals were

215
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,310
almost never locked many had again had

216
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,110
no locks so you could technically waltz

217
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,219
right in there if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to staff</font>

218
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,750
laundry so I've been told staff laundry

219
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,200
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> found along with forgot name</font>

220
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,089
tags on them so you could technically

221
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,209
act as if you were you know one of them

222
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a anywhere from a thousand</font>

223
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,170
two thousand crew members so they don't

224
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,180
know everybody so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away</font>

225
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,160
with something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found a total</font>

226
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,839
of six passenger bat badges sitting by

227
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,160
the pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those their associated</font>

228
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,630
with a credit card that's where it gets

229
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,329
a little bit scary because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

230
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,689
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge up a bunch of drinks and</font>

231
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:02,099
put it right back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah they might</font>

232
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not know until the very last day the</font>

233
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,160
cruise when they get built so there's

234
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,450
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the</font>

235
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,060
cruise lines fault by the way that's

236
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,680
that's just people being people picture

237
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,239
of evocation of passenger when a card is

238
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,760
swiped the employees are supposed to

239
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
take a look when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they swipe their card</font>

240
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,589
for a drink it shows the picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,720
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the problem is they don't</font>

242
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,100
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they just they're</font>

243
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,410
just they're just busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> churning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

244
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,149
drinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there is a safeguard in</font>

245
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:33,209
place it's just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well utilized</font>

246
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:35,760
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the employees okay alright so again a</font>

247
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of crew areas are don't necessarily</font>

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,170
have locks and some are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well</font>

249
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,089
guarded it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a closer</font>

250
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,229
view on that it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like</font>

251
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,420
freezer curtains

252
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:52,320
so you know that's going to keep a lot

253
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:54,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out alright so here we are</font>

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,130
engine control room<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I have never</font>

255
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,000
been in an engine control room I have

256
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">never been in the bridge some cruise</font>

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,070
ships allow this depending on your

258
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,410
member status on certain cruise lines

259
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,020
not all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I found this on</font>

260
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,150
the Internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is the engine</font>

261
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">control room obviously heavily</font>

262
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:20,750
computerized this is the bridge<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

263
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,340
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just found this on the internet</font>

264
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,590
if you look a little closer you can see

265
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,840
the well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't really see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it here</font>

266
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,780
but the navigation system is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sperry</font>

267
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,620
marine vision mazzer master ft the issue

268
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:37,880
of this is it runs windows XP they all

269
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,260
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and they're still all utilized</font>

270
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,600
and then ships this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not really any</font>

271
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,030
upgrades going on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

272
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,030
see a problem there so after the cruise

273
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:54,780
oops went too far sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so the</font>

274
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,730
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> internships so public IP</font>

275
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,040
addresses each ship has an IP address

276
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,110
range associated with it we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

277
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,640
that a second they're all on something

278
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,540
called the maritime telecommunications

279
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,790
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the MTN basically handles</font>

280
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">up well I get to it here in a second</font>

281
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,870
I'll actually go into more detail and

282
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,699
there's several internet-facing

283
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,550
vulnerabilities and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss those</font>

284
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:21,480
here in a second again all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to do</font>

285
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,949
is use an errand who is and showed an to

286
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,700
do all this so like I see any of you

287
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,750
could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay looking at things from</font>

288
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,150
the outside the maritime

289
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,970
telecommunications network uses this IP

290
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,880
address range so all of the ships or I

291
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,730
can't say all most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ships whether</font>

292
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,520
it be cruise lines or military vessels

293
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,840
so on and so forth are normally

294
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,660
connected to the maritime

295
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,620
telecommunications network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

296
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,620
internet of ships

297
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,888
okay this just explains what the MTN is

298
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,750
and what it does see if I forget

299
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything luxury yachts oil rigs</font>

300
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,860
government military vessels and cruise

301
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:06,829

302
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:10,279
service providers went out at sea ok so

303
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:13,399
again all these ships have IP address

304
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:16,880
ranges that are actually specific to dg2

305
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,949
these ships Tahitian princess diamond

306
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,620
princess island princess emerald

307
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:26,899
princess so on and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

308
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,850
there believe me there's many many more

309
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just kind of let it slide I'm going to</font>

310
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:39,070
skip right past<font color="#E5E5E5"> this here okay this one</font>

311
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,420
is my trust fund again luxury yachts

312
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,360
those are the jokes people that's that's

313
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,469
all I got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you might want to be</font>

314
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,899
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit careful love you can</font>

315
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,680
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess what's in this range</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

316
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:57,709
leak right there's also another one

317
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:04,269
called like was it a carnival HQ wonder

318
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:08,239
what that is okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that speaks for itself</font>

319
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:11,199
so anyway a few statistics here using

320
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,730
some old encryption methods here

321
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,939
obviously they have boner abilities

322
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,350
associated with them some of the

323
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,000
services running on these these are

324
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:27,440
again these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward-facing services</font>

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,630
some issues there pcanywhere windows

326
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,459
room windows remote management and the

327
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,730
most clever thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen tona</font>

328
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:43,518
I'm port 23 23 stated they were the

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:45,069
first to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that one out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

330
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,639
this is where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a little creepy</font>

331
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,800
that top one though<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay debian for lost</font>

remember what month but obviously it's a

334
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,810
little old something like it you can

335
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,550
read them voice over IP systems on a

alrighty then<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so some cruise</font>

actually contacted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

357
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,070
cruise line and they're like yeah we're

00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:15,750
okay with that I'm okay with that too

359

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,740
other issues i haven't heard replies on

361
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,319
you know they may be there thinking oh

362
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,210
 and they're kind of doing what they

363
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,830
got to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i understand that some of</font>

these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> take time imagine these</font>

little while so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and upgrade</font>

369
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,760
that so on and so forth over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

370

<font color="#CCCCCC">years though each cruise line is</font>

371
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,939
steadily<font color="#E5E5E5"> increased their wireless</font>

372
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,550
security of a better encryption we hope

373
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,310
so their internet key s have gone from

374
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,829
pcs with windows XP now this in 2005 so

375
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:52,040
you know but now they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

376
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vista</font>

using chrome and incognito mode with

378
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:05,610
deep freeze so at least they're trying

379
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyway okay that's all I got I'd</font>

wine yeah oh yeah when you sign up first

408
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,140
for every cruise I've been on as you're

409
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,690
signing up for the cruise they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font>

410
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,299
check the box have you are you expecting

but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do pick one pick anniversary</font>

414
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:44,409
that's usually the most lucrative yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

415
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,350
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't suppose you've looked into</font>

416
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,940
the jurisdictional issues of hacking a

417
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,428
cruise ship for instance like if you're

418
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,470
in international waters on a par<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patos</font>

419
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,120
flagship who comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you if you do</font>

420
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,580
something you shouldn't do well first

421
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,559
off you shouldn't do anything no no no

422
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,389
obviously no never never hack anything

423
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,490
ever but right right dude hack something

424
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay who arrests you yeah that's a good</font>

425
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,419
question i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you should accidentally</font>

426
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:12,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay theoretically okay i would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assume</font>

427
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:14,799
there's some sort of maritime law

428
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,299
regarding that as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as who comes in</font>

429
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,490
bus yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess the next port of call</font>

430
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,070
or maybe at the very end if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you left out</font>

440
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know knowledge is power and all that</font>

441
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,610
yes question how's it going<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I was</font>

442
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you when you're</font>

443
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,928
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cruise line operators</font>

444
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:14,489
if you ever bring up the subject of like

445
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:16,710
denial of service especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their</font>

446
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,710
wireless links like what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

447
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,809
were to plant a box on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cruise ship or</font>

448
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,659
any ship that basically disrupts all GPS

449
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,760
signals or<font color="#CCCCCC"> vsat what if somebody finds</font>

450
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:30,899
one open on show Dan and like terms it

451
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,730
off I wonder what sort of yep that's

452
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,250
something I hope I never see especially

453
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,600
while I'm on the ship yeah yeah i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

454
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,779
don't know if that subjects ever come up

455
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,879
when you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to them well i would</font>

456
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:43,740
assume they have several backup systems

457
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,210
again they're on they as part of a

458
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,130
satellite network so maybe there's other

459
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,000
things they could sure there's some kind

460
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,559
of backups<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would hope but do i know</font>

461
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sure no the satellite</font>

462
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,408
navigation systems if you've ever been

463
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a cruise ship they had these big</font>

464
00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:01,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">globes outside okay well that's it and</font>

465
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,549
you can usually touch them over the rail

466
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,200
so that's kind of creepy yes sir yeah um

467
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,340
obviously container ships won't offer

468
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,350
you the same perks if it's your

469
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,809
anniversary and your shipping cargo but

470
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,779
how much of what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the cruise ships</font>

471
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,820
such as navigation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of</font>

472
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,590
physical facilities how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

473
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,149
carry over into the container ship fleet

474
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,149
pretty much the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> except for</font>

475
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">the free stuff speaking of which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

476
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:28,559
actually submitted this presentation

477
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,799
februari 72 2016 I didn't find out until

478
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,620
May I was doing some google searching

479
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:38,100
and found that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> somali pirates</font>

480
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:41,389
actually compromised a container ship

481
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,678
manifesto<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make themselves more</font>

482
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:45,029
efficient at being pirates so they knew

483
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,010
where all the good stuff was because

484
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,039
they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a manifesto of everything</font>

485
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,809
that was on the ship so

486
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,580
so what about the navigational data

487
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,350
coming back you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know on the on the</font>

488
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,320
public side of the ship it'll tell you

489
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,520
basically where it is all the time yeah

490
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,740
there's well there's actually maps

491
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,809
online maps to show you where every ship

492
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,789
is pretty much all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the world in</font>

493
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:14,168
international waters is everybody else

494
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:17,190
any more questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thanks Jeff</font>

495
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:17,190
