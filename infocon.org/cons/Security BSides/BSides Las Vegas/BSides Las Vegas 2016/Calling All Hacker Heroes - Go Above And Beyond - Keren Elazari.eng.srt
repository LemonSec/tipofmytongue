kinds of shapes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sizes and guess what</font>

85
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,120

90
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,269
all my stickers I can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flight</font>

91
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,370
attendants get nervous when I you know

92
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,630
go to get my hair done and then they ask

93
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,550
me so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you do for a living and I</font>

94
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,079
was like yeah I'm a hacker no like

95
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,910
you're a hacker and you just say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

96
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,100
that shouldn't you keep it a secret

97
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,130
isn't that criminal aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font>

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,160
wrong stuff and what I do with everybody

99
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,989
asks me is that I say I am proud<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

100
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,290
myself a hacker and you know what else

101
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,260
it is way too hot to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear hoodies in Tel</font>

102
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,720
Aviv where I come from anyway all right

103
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,489
just trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that one but you know</font>

104
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,980
some of us are kind of like day job

105
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,048
hackers right like Clark Kent in the

106
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,909
morning we're all cool and suits<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in</font>

107
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,919
the evening where Superman or at least

108
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of the narrative that</font>

109
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,720
people expect maybe people watching mr.

110
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,970
robot and shows like that they want

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,980
packers to have that split personality

112
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,380
it'll be the good guy and then you know

113
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,110
separate their lives and their personal

114
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,520
choices from that I think being a hero

115
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,740
is a little bit more complex to that

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,890
than that actually and it's not a cookie

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,570
cutter thing right if not just be the

118
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:49,349
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing be that Clark Kent or that</font>

119
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,969
Superman with the straight-laced morals

120
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,650
and ethics and that's it and that's the

121
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">way it goes as anyone here seen the</font>

122
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,150
Batman vs Superman or latest movie I

123
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a movie that really brings</font>

124
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,340
to light that conflict I'm a big comic

125

210
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,200
how my life turned out speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a desk</font>

211
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,140
on a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years ago 2014 was a real</font>

go if you haven't submitted a talk to

215
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,439

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,240
had another dream come true that same

218
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,870
year maybe some of you have seen or

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,640
heard about it in 2014 I was invited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

220
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">be the first Israeli woman to speak at</font>

221
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,860
the International TED conference that's

222
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,890
like the big tent like the Bill Gates is

sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of me kind of Ted and I</font>

224
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,210
freaked out obviously but i think the

225
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,340
talk went very well and my idea that

226
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">hackers are the heroes or the immune</font>

227
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,980
system for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information age really</font>

228
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:54,180
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of became viral if we don't mind</font>

234
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,020
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong in the talk which is</font>

235
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">very embarrassing when like two million</font>

236
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen it so in the original</font>

237
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,520
script what I was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what I</font>

238
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,760
was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say was that that hackers</font>

239
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,680
are the immune system for the

240
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">information age not just for the</font>

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,239
internet right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

242
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,670
Internet is just like one part of what

243
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,740
we all do that's not everything the

244
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,969
internet does not include you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

245
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,970
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know laser sure</font>

246
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,850
autonomous robots for example not yet

247
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,009
anyway but we'll get there but the Ted

248
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,449
folks just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> quad me saying the</font>

249
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,310
internet and that's it you know it lives

250
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,500
on for posterity but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the thing we</font>

251
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,989
do really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need that immune system for</font>

252
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,259
our entire world in fact for our

253
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,689
universe this is the internet or rather

254
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> World Wide Web about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

255
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:57,870
and that's kind of a visualization of

256
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,120
you know website or servers that you

257
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,129
could discover on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet that's</font>

258
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,230
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

259
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:06,480
defend as heroes if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to show you</font>

260
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,639
what our current world looks like it

261
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,589
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Milky Way right it's a</font>

262
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,540
galaxy and just like our universe it

263
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,000
keeps expanding it becomes bigger and

264
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,670
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are dark corners to it</font>

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,100
dark corners that the world does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

266
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:24,779
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about or protect or even</font>

267
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,689
visit but we are the pioneers we are the

268
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,730
explorers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this universe because we go</font>

269
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:33,240
there first right we go to the dark web

270
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:36,329
first and we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we use show done to</font>

271
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,610
identify devices in hardware that is

272
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,319
discoverable on the interwebs before

273
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,819
everybody else knows about it so guess

274
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:44,579
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in like we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font>

275
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility as the pioneers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

276
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,829
place maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the natives if you're</font>

277
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,149
with me on the analogy there I know

278
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,000
there's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of analogies this</font>

279
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:56,250
morning so maybe less analogies more

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,399
funny stuff well here's a funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in</font>

281
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:04,139
this universe we have our villain every

282
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">good hero needs a good villain and</font>

283
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,600
here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the villains are I</font>

284
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,719
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the villains of</font>

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,689
cybersecurity our government agencies or

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,339
cyber criminals in the Ukraine or you

287
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:19,500
know somewhere like that part of my

288
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,689
friends from the Ukraine I think the

289
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,350
real villains that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to fight our</font>

290
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:28,139
bugs software and hardware vulnerability

291
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,759
and guess what as our universe keeps

292
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,399
expanding they're going to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

293
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">more bugs and they're not like alien</font>

294
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,449
bugs there you know software and

295
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,769
hardware button and they're in stuff

296
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:39,630
that we didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about stuff</font>

297
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:42,329
that is just now getting connected to

298
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,689
other stuff whether it's gsm or radio

299
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,339
frequency stuff or

300
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,220
no a freaking laser shooting autonomous

301

robot on Mars<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just happens to be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">running one of the most vulnerable and</font>

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,630
what that popular software and computing

309
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,439
it is not windows XP it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> java it is</font>

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,970
java java java runtime javascript all

311
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,250
that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and guess what even the Mars</font>

312
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,870
Curiosity rover has java and its

313

operating system and the hardened

314
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,650
embedded operating system are supposed

315
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,260
to do you know live out there in space

316
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,780
for decades so that's a scary concept

317
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,760
right there isn't it and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

318
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,250
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating more and more code as</font>

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,710
humans write more code even if we let a

eyes or boss or machines or algorithms

321
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,750
write our code we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go from</font>

322
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,280
the you know 100,000 count of you know

323
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,790
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred thousand lines of code</font>

324
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,370
for an iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> app maybe a couple more</font>

325
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a game design engine like quake but</font>

326
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,990
we're quickly jumping into the 50

327
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,050
million lines of code 100 million lines

328
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:03,100
of code for stuff like cars so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

329
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,780
be naive to not expect the bugs to

330
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,730
already be there and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be even</font>

331
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,220
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> naive and perhaps even childish of</font>

332
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,200
us of us to expect the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

333
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,000
make this code or the government's that

334
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,760
are supposed to regulate all these

335
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,020
different new fields of industry that

336
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,000
have never before thought about

337
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,100
cybersecurity you know the automotive

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,120
people or the medical device people or

339
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,589
that aviation people you know the

340
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">airlines they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of waking up</font>

341
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,820
to something we've known for a while so

342
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,560
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take them even longer</font>

343
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,580
while to adjust while they figure

344
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,349
they're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know frak out we need to be</font>

345
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,540
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to step up we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

346
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,390
the cavalry how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well one</font>

347
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,400
thing I think which could<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us do</font>

348
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,130
that is be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really vigilant for these</font>

349
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,900
sort of like super villains right these

350
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">are like the super mega bugs like</font>

351
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:55,540
heartbleed and bash shell shock bugs

352
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,880
that are in stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody uses</font>

353
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,399
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wild for like months</font>

354
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,079
and years and nobody knew about them and

355
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody fixed them because nobody cared</font>

356
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,739
and nobody bothered to book so that

357
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,660
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area I would encourage you</font>

358
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to focus your energies your research and</font>

359
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">also your protection efforts in your</font>

360
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,940
organization's i would ask where is our

361
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,680
third party software coming from and you

362
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,180
know what it's it's a puzzle right when

363
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,229
you get a piece of software for somebody

364
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,779
if you're a company that's buying a

365
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,759
product i find it hilarious that right

366
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,459
now i<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have like a candy bar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

367
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,199
could buy a candy bar or kind bar and it

368
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,239
would say all the things in it it's got

369
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,250
nuts and it's got chocolate it's got

370
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,050
cherries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd know exactly what's in</font>

371
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,730
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if I'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-building a company</font>

372
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,319
that's buying another multi-billion

373
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">company's code and software and</font>

374
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:42,490
technology I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what</font>

375
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,130
all of the third party software

376
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,500
libraries are in it don't you think

377
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a little bit silly how are we</font>

378
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,880
going to keep track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all this</font>

379
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,680
vulnerable software I'll one idea which

380
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I think you learn</font>

381
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,800
more about later today is the idea of

382
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,779
software bill of materials so a list of

383
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,939
ingredients for what's in the software

384
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">and guess what this is an area where you</font>

385
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,690
can be the heroes in your place of work

386
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:10,240
let's say you make decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

387
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,940
buying technology can you ask the vendor

388
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,130
what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the software actually if you</font>

389
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,230
are a consumer how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys use</font>

390
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,170
facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess a bunch of you use</font>

391
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,180
facebook I recently decided to maybe not

392
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,729
use Facebook as much i made the personal

393
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,339
choice based on some security analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

394
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,649
did and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did was look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

395
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,529
app on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my phone and try and figure out</font>

396
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the third party software that</font>

397
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,899
that app was using and i found a bunch

398
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finding so</font>

399
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,529
take a minute to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the stuff</font>

400
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just accept blindly and</font>

401
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:46,449
willingly as a product<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a black box</font>

402
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,010
would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat like a candy bar that was</font>

403
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:49,149
in a black rapper and you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

404
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,980
what's in it would you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in your</font>

405
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,540
body well some of us are more

406
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,819
adventurous<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess you'd put all kinds</font>

407
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,910
of stuff in your bodies and that's cool

408
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:59,920
too no judging however when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to</font>

409
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,290
software that could hurt or you know

410
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,670
influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> human lives that's where you</font>

411
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,438
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a difference with your</font>

412
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,299
choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think and you can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a stand</font>

413
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
as a consumer as a private individual as

414
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,770
a corporate but guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

415
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,659
leave in a government we leave it to the

416
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">regulators to figure this out they are</font>

417
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,439
going to fail not because they're not

418
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,380
good or because they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix</font>

419
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,480
this because it's there just slower to

420
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,199
adapt because they're not natives to

421
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,819
this world and we are so why should we

422
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,700
be looking for bugs and doing the sort

423
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of security research work not just for</font>

424
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,549
fame fun and fortune although all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

425
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,129
can be found in the security

426
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:41,820
professionals life not just adventure

427
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,790
and excitement know for the future do it

428
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,860
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kids I know it sounds like a</font>

429
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,899
joke but I'm actually serious I don't

430
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,939
have kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet I'd like to have some soon</font>

431
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,740
I'd like them to grow up in the world

432
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,780
with technology they can trust

433
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,730
technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can let them trust</font>

434
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,668
because i am a techno optimist in my

435
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,440
nature but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just going to happen</font>

436
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">by itself it's not a you know it's not</font>

437
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">like gravity security and privacy are</font>

438
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,879
efforts that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and time and</font>

439
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,860
thinking they don't just happen by

440
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,630
themselves and bugs are going to be

441
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,668
there so one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been asking</font>

442
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,710
myself recently a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's the</font>

443
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,270
impact of bug bounty programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

444
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,520
you all heard about bug bounty programs

445
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,379
yeah you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them if you</font>

446
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,970
haven't they're great I think they're

447
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,650
great ways for companies to collaborate

448
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,299
with hackers but I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

449
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,100
are questioning you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so many</font>

450
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,440
bug bounty programs out there these days

451
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,139
and thanks to bug crowd for creating

452
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,630
this great evolution or timeline of the

453
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,549
history of bug bounties in the past 20

454
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,470
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're really come very far now</font>

455
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,049
you can find a bug bounty program to

456
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,010
report errors in popular sites like

457
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:49,260
youporn yahoo and united airlines just

458
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,809
to name a few big bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

459
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,160
that's pretty cool actually however I've

460
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,440
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really asking the question what is</font>

461
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,480
the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these programs and one</font>

462
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,669
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know people are discussing for</font>

463
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,070
researchers why should they give up

464
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,350
their vulnerability that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they found or</font>

465
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,540
their time or their effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help a</font>

466
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,219
company maybe they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a gift car</font>

467
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,139
like a hundred dollar gift card or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

468
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,460
thousand dollar gift card you can't make

469
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a living from that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can make a</font>

470
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:17,850
six-figure salary from that well that's

471
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,250
right no you can't however<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

472
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point bug bounty programs are not</font>

473
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,820
there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you get rich fast</font>

474
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to find more</font>

475
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,310
bugs faster so it's about scale and

476
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,110
scope and size it's a gal it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

477
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,030
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thousands of you know</font>

478
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,629
independent friendly hackers out there

479
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:41,290
in the world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an easy way to find</font>

480
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,240
problems in code and I did a little

481
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,800
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some of the data coming</font>

482
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,810
from programs like the Google program

483
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,639
which is very big the facebook program

484
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft program I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interviewed some</font>

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,330
individual people running programs and

486
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,950
participating in some and this was all

487
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,750
done as part of my work at Tel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aviv</font>

488
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,670
University I'm a researcher there and

489
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,370
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I discovered which was very</font>

490
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,230
surprising to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me is that bug bounties</font>

491
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,699
are great for finding more bug faster

492
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,830
yes we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

493
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,540
intuitive well they also create

494
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,610
awareness and reputation and media

495
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,200
attention because now you know United

496
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,300
Airlines wants to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people about</font>

497
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,490
their bug bounty program because they

498
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,340
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the positive PR that's a part of</font>

499
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,620
that I'm okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them I'm okay with</font>

500
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,840
United getting some positive PR points

501
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,120
if it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a bug bounty</font>

502
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,159
program and let me tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why my mom</font>

503
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,290
was an airline manager for 20 years I

504
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,270
can now come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my mom and say hey</font>

505
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,370
you know United this huge airline did

506
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the website has bugs but</font>

507
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,909
hackers are actually helping fix those

508
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,980
bugs and they get some miles in return

509
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,710
and my mom would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay I'm cool with</font>

510
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's pretty awesome so that's why</font>

511
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have bug bounty programs</font>

512
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,860
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people can't make six-figure</font>

513
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:51,370
salaries out of them or you know huge

514
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,189
desk on blockbuster 4,000 people talks

515
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,080
about moving planes from side to side

516
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if they're getting bugs</font>

517
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,710
fixed that's cool I'm cool with it but

518
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last thing which really surprised me</font>

519
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,450
was that these bug bounty programs

520
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,729
around the world are creating a new

521
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,550
workforce so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a practical</font>

522
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">example this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the google data for</font>

523
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">their bug bounty program in 2014 and</font>

524
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,790
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> map shows is where the</font>

525
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,250
researchers are coming from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

526
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,780
Google is said is that most of them are

527
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,450
not from North America as you might

528
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect but actually Europe Central</font>

529
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:28,090
Europe Eastern Europe Asia Africa even

530
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,830
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Australia so it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> global</font>

531
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,159
thing and especially in some places like

532
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,439
Africa Asia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Latin</font>

533
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erica some of the researchers reporting</font>

534
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:40,080
for these bugs these are people getting

535
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,120
legitimately paid on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and up for</font>

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">security research work and the first</font>

538
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,830
created an alternative to the dark side

539
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,100
in a sense yes maybe they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not making</font>

540
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,530
six-figure salaries of of their zero-day

541
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,300
vulnerabilities but they are joining our

542

yeah you guys 20 years in that's me

551
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,820
we're the desert generation desert

552
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,710
generation there's a concept from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

Jewish Bible I won't get into it but the

554
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,660
fact is 20th century is gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

555
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a new era and we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the help</font>

556
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,190
we can get so we need more people in

557
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,380
this industry and bug bounty programs

558
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,990
are one way to get people in which is

559
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,390
why I'm a fan and you know Cisco says we

560
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,270
need 1 million people more in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

561
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,450
industry that's their data they did a

562
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty decent study on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the workforce</font>

563

564
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,960
removed 40 or 50 so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need</font>

565
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,360
these programs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help get more people</font>

566
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,790

567
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,290
build the bridges so what do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font>

568
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:01,680
bridges some places where there was once

569
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,440
a firewall there is now a collaboration

570
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,320
opportunity case in point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pentagon</font>

571
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,450
right the u.s. DoD one of probably the

572
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,450
most conservative bastions of old-school

573
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,360
power opening up wide to work with

574
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,370
hackers I guess that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like really</font>

575
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,500
romantic and naive but it's actually

576
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,199
creating some cool impact in the real

577
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,550
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's showing other</font>

578
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,650
organizations other nation-states other

579
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,879
countries other agencies that there is

580
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,740
potential here because if the Pentagon

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">is doing it well maybe you know the</font>

582
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,730
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Israel can do it maybe</font>

583
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,680
united airlines<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spoke about that</font>

584
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,450
their million mile reward for

585
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability discovery yeah so maybe</font>

586
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,630
they only<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it because of this guy and</font>

587
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,180
they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin the story I don't</font>

588
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,570
know why United<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden</font>

589
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,390
to have a

590
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:51,120
about the program but I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

591
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy there is one right and I'm happy</font>

592
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,989
that this guy did his research and spoke

593
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,210
up about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the way that he did in</font>

594
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,130
fact for those of you not familiar with

595
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,260
sea dragon one that's the tweet heard

596
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,090
around the world where last year he got

597
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,340
on a plane on his way to besides in San

598
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and was tweeting some of this</font>

599
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,429
stuff up and it created a whole viral

600
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:14,820
mess unpleasant for him unpleasant for

601
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:16,530
United in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> o one year later maybe</font>

602
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,530
some difference in the world maybe

603
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,810
that's my point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view anyway so these</font>

604
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,100
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hackers and companies to</font>

605
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,929
talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other are creating an</font>

606
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,659
alternative to the dark side if you will

607
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think so here's another tweet I saw</font>

608
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,540
recently I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know who this guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is by</font>

609
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,540
the way if you know when tell them i<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

610
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,670
hi he the guy who found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day and</font>

611
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,620
the vendor ignored him so he decided to

612
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,810
create an exploit in the hope that now

613
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,429
they do not ignore him that's his choice

614
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make and I understand where he's</font>

615
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming from however guess that vendor</font>

616
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,969
could have done things<font color="#CCCCCC"> differently by</font>

617
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,639
not ignoring with God so if you are

618
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">working for a vendor don't ignore</font>

619
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,210
hackers really simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just do</font>

620
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,510
the basics respond there is no better

621
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,280
disinfectant than the light of day right

622
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,140
that's so powerful it's worth saying it

623
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,149
again there is no better disinfectant

624
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,550
than the light of day when they get more

625
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,580
research work done faster and out there

626
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,200
in the world and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we can so</font>

627
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,639
something I'm extremely excited about

628
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,590
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tried out personally is this</font>

629
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,350
totally new project that you can all

630
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,090
join the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beta it's free and it's up for</font>

631
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,360
download right now it's called zero

632
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,220
patch zero like the number 0 and 0 patch

633
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,919
is a new technology by a bunch of

634
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,170
hackers from sylvania who got tired of

635
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,670
their pen testing work being so easy so

636
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,710
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> always use vulnerabilities</font>

637
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,750
that were already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the wild and had</font>

638
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,780
known exploits for them what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys</font>

639
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,440
created was a tool for micro patching

640
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:47,070
software without the vendors consent

641
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,990
approval or no<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how but that's cool</font>

642
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,550
they're not interfering<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the vendor</font>

643
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,680
software so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you a practical</font>

644
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">example once again i try to self let's</font>

645
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,540
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm running Fox it do you know Fox</font>

646
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,870
fit the popular PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reader alternative</font>

647
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,300
to

648
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,010
acrobat also has a bunch of zero days or

649
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,200
you know vulnerabilities maybe not zero

650
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,270
days well known well documented in the

651
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,030
wild vulnerabilities the guys at zero

652
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,710
patch created a micro patch that you run

653
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,470
in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine and it prevents this</font>

654
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,290
exploit from running in a I tried it out

655
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:19,050
with a weaponized PDF and this is the i

656
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,059
got this message that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i blocked it and</font>

657
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,139
this is done without any knowledge

658
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,850
cooperation or authorization by<font color="#CCCCCC"> fox it</font>

659
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,650
but it didn't do it in the darkness they

660
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,730
blogged about it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to them</font>

661
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,440
about it they let them know they're

662
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it because they can get these</font>

663
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,940
micro patches done much faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> fox</font>

664
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,559
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their attention to fixing</font>

665
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,390
their vulnerable code if you're

666
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,610
interested in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest you take</font>

667
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know give it a try maybe create a</font>

668
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,050
micro patch yourself so perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

669
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,449
next generation of bug bounty programs

670
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,370
will be patched bounty programs people

671

<font color="#E5E5E5">creating micro patches for vulnerable</font>

672
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,610
software and fixing it hey what's up you

673
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,510
want a sticker okay then stay quite till

674
