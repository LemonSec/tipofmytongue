1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,290
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover some of the</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,259
major developments and then we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the specific areas that</font>

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,719
cavalry focuses on so medical

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,360
transportation public infrastructure and

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,490
home and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,350
how you guys can get engaged in policy

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,869
should you so wish to do so in terms of

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,449
major developments this is the biggie

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,219
the gold standard major development that

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,230
we have seen in the past year that has

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,930
had an impact on what i would call cyber

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,589
safety what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> all call cyber</font>

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,030
safety perhaps so basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmca who</font>

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,239
is familiar with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMC a quick show of</font>

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,370
hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't firmly need to</font>

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,968
tell most of you but in a nutshell the

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,750
US has to copyright laws because one is

19
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,280
just for losers so there's one that

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically says copyrights a thing and we</font>

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,120
should respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> copyright we like real</font>

22
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,048
copyright and then there's a DMCA which

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,479
says so about that copyright<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing yeah</font>

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,400
we were serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that so if you</font>

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,580
circumvent technical protections<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,010
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect copyright that's that's</font>

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,450
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us so not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,060
copyright issue but also these

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,030
circumventing technical protections what

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:27,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of research has</font>

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:29,189
been subject to the dunes yet because

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,549
often research involves supplementing

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,949
technical protections now what the DMCA

34
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,890
does it does kind of things firstly it

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,460
has some permanent carve out some

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,649
permanent exemptions to address this

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,119
problem but they're very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow so</font>

38
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,579
one of them is about reversing the

39
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,720
hardware but it has very narrow

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,479
restrictions and one of them is about

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,600
testing security of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data in transit</font>

42
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,210
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> very narrow very narrow</font>

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
boundaries so if you wanted to do things

44
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,079
like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at firmware traditionally that</font>

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,590
has been frowned upon when I say frowned

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,790
upon I mean with handcuffs

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,730
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMCA also has the secondary thing</font>

48
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,950
it does where it says okay this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

49
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,709
technological controls and technology

50
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,179
moves faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than law so what we're</font>

51
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,209
going to do is we're going to say every

52
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,480
three years will open a process where

53
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,799
you can apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an exemption and you</font>

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,920
apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Copyright Office and the</font>

55
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:42,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">library of progress because they know a</font>

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot about security research so so that's</font>

57
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,500
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is you apply</font>

58
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,569
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then every three years any</font>

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,000
exemptions that exist apart from the

60
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:53,328
permanent ones I just mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollback</font>

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,579
so even if you already got some in you

62
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,900
you lose them and you have to go through

63
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,489
the process again and they have this

64
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,769
sort of multi-layered process where you

65
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,180
apply and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's a common period</font>

66
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,069
where people can say no that sucks i

67
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,329
hate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's another comment</font>

68
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,940
period where people can say no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love it</font>

69
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's great we should do it and then</font>

70
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,780
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some testifying that happens</font>

71
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,250
testify and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the library of</font>

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">congress and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Copyright Office look</font>

73
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,319
at all of this stuff and they go and

74
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,019
they talk to other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,510
government and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen and they come</font>

76
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and they say yes or no on your</font>

77
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,090
exemption so why is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a major thing</font>

78
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,179
for us well<font color="#CCCCCC"> last year we went through</font>

79
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,139
this process and there are a whole bunch

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,340
of people who participated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> requesting</font>

81
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:39,019
exemptions for security research there

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,030
were four<font color="#E5E5E5"> security research requests</font>

83
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:44,000
that went in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for security research</font>

84
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:49,930
for medical devices one for security

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,730
research for cars and two for general

86
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,030
consumer oriented technology consumer

87
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,290
research so the Copyright Office and the

88
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,639
library of congress got all these in

89
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,019
together they look to all of them they

90
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,579
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of overlap we</font>

91
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,709
should do something that encompasses all

92
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:08,510
of them and they went and they talked to

93
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:13,370
knit<font color="#CCCCCC"> so who went and they they talked to</font>

94
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA and they talked to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA at</font>

95
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> department</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Commerce who said yes</font>

96
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,779
security researchers a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

97
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,209
helps us support a free and open

98
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,000
Internet we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> support it it's good</font>

99
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,730
we like it and so they said oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's good right we like it yes up</font>

101
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:32,330
these technology manufacturers<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

102
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,980
and their alliances they<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem less</font>

103
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,800
enthusiastic about the whole idea

104
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:43,160
they've written some letters what should

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do and it's on earth and I'm the FDA</font>

106
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,700
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA gave much more balanced</font>

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,430
advice and so eventually what happened

108
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,710
was the library<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone rest of the</font>

109
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,270
Copyright Office said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we will have</font>

110
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,539
an exemption for security research one

111
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,599
exemption and it will cover any

112
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,940
consumer-oriented technology provided

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,500
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in production so no wandering</font>

114
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,469
around hospitals unplugging and

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,680
plugging in usps sorry to spoil your fun

116
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,360
but because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all a little bit</font>

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,480
like we're not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what to do</font>

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,570
and it's still going out we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,400
delay it for a year so you can you can

120
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,200
do this it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> come into effect but</font>

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,169
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it being immediate we're</font>

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delay it for a year except for</font>

123
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:30,920
voting machines cuz there's kind of a

124
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:35,210
thing coming up so please go test voting

125
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,010
machines so anyway uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the deadline</font>

126
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:41,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this when it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into effect is</font>

127
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,650
October so for the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,770
traditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> not considered themselves</font>

129
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,710
technology providers of which in the IOT

130
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,750
space we deal with many who you know

131
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,729
they're now dealing with lots and lots

132
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,900
and lots of lines of code but don't

133
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,190
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves a technology</font>

134
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,289
providers they think of themselves as

135
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,210
car makers or medical device makers or

136
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,540
whatever it is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people they</font>

137
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of looming deadline and</font>

138
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:09,110
it has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact it has an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact that</font>

139
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're seeing already and the actions of</font>

140
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,500
some of these companies that don't

141
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,800
consider themselves technology providers

142
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,630
but increasingly are there are numerous

143
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,940
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this one is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTA process</font>

144

of the on vulnerability disclosure there

145
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,600
have been many automakers and some of

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,210
have attributed their participation is a

149
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,310
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a better dialogue with their</font>

150
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,469
regulator because it demonstrates that

151
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,030
they recognize this is an issue that

152
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,169
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that they are</font>

engaging on it

154
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:45,919
in addition GM and January of this year

155
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,620
published avoid disclosure policy and

156
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,818
coordination with hacker one then in

157
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,749
April May Johnson & Johnson published a

coordinated vulnerability disclosure

159

program as well and then most<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

160
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,159
in July fiat-chrysler America FCA

161
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,498
published a bug bounty program in

coordination with<font color="#CCCCCC"> bug crab great so</font>

163
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:10,129
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to see like real</font>

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,508
developments and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance's in this</font>

165
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,150
space are kind of pushing their members

166
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,430
to kind of understand hey October is

167
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,989
going to happen researchers who have

168
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,339
been too afraid to disclose in the past

169
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,779
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been storing up vulnerabilities</font>

170
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,370
are going to suddenly come out the

171
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,839
woodwork and they are going to disclose

172
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,759
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to have</font>

173
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,870
processes in place to deal with this so

174
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,909
we are seeing a huge cultural shift

175
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,080
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually awesome i mean this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

176
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,688
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible thing we could</font>

177
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,270
hope for bear in mind though we have two

178
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:37,789
years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then this goes away and we</font>

179
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,729
start the process again so the battle is

180
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,409
certainly not done done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because of</font>

181
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,990
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this sort of strange</font>

182
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:48,620
process where you're applying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:52,879
library of congress which looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

184
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,229
very technological place because you're

185
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
applying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the library of congress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

186
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,688
the Copyright Office and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

187
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,990
through this sort of strangely intensive

188
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,550
process and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of uncertainty</font>

189
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,250
and and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is about something</font>

190
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that isn't a copyright issue I mean most</font>

191
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,089
researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't as far as I understand</font>

192
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,620
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to defraud any</font>

193
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,539
company in terms of the copyright stuff

194
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,219
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like hey you move</font>

195
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,399
on ability let's fix it not put people

196
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:22,039
at risk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not really a</font>

197
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,379
copyright issue at its core there are

198
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,199
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the DMCA</font>

199
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,879
changed at a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more basic level</font>

200
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,300
and there are a number of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

201
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,769
of approaching this one is to work

202
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,779
through sort of more traditional roots

203
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:39,078
of getting congressional support<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

204
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,818
to get legal reform the corporate office

205
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:42,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">for it's worth is actually quite</font>

206
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:44,059
supportive of all of that in

207
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,230
conversations that we've had with them

208
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">they'd be like yeah yeah we don't really</font>

209
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,750
we don't really know about this we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we should be making</font>

211
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions on it we're happy to support</font>

212
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:57,269
this another route to go

213
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:59,850
is you could launch legal action against

214
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:02,670
the Copyright Office which is what the

215
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:07,350
eff and some other people are doing that

216
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,759
was announced to the last week I don't

217
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,839
wanna get too much into it because I

218
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,980
really like the FF but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

219
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,180
my personal view on this is that a

220
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,740
better path forward is through

221
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,628
collaboration and finding common ground

222
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,079
and building trust I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

223
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,269
massive theme of I am the cavalry and if

224
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,469
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trust and find</font>

225
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,259
collaborative opportunities this is

226
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,300
possibly not the room for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> um in all</font>

227
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,920
honesty and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of feel like you</font>

228
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,670
know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sue people you sort of</font>

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,319
undermine a lot of that and whilst I

230
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,628
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect Alan to comment in any way</font>

231
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">shape or form I imagine that when you</font>

232
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,920
know when the research community decides

233
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,709
to sue the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Copyright Office it does make</font>

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,839
the advocates that we have had feel a

235
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,660
little sheepish in continuing to

236
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,490
advocate for us so they go that's my

237
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,610
personal view on air I still love the FF

238
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,430
in support of the eff but that's my

239
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,620
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> T so developments medical I've</font>

240
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,758
been talking a lot so we're going to ask

241
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,889
some other people to come and talk

242
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,769
instead so first we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome</font>

243
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,000
Suzanne<font color="#E5E5E5"> Schwartz from the FDA who's</font>

244
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:19,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about some changes they</font>

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:33,300
have made which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cool uh yeah</font>

246
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:36,769
yeah have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my yeah so a lot of what Jen</font>

247
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,800
had provided in the introduction are

248
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:44,130
areas and items that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we feel very very</font>

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,829
much aligned with and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

250
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,259
a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually so how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

251
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:52,709
have had any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interaction at all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and obviously we're a regulatory agency</font>

it's our<font color="#CCCCCC"> center our medical product</font>

265
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:34,079
huge awakening for the FDA as well as

266
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,910
for more broadly speaking I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say</font>

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:41,219
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare and medical device</font>

268

challenges with respect to medical

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,480
device vulnerabilities and the need to

271

<font color="#CCCCCC">address those vulnerabilities so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

272
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,100
were to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back a few years time</font>

273
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,120
somewheres around the 2013 period the

274
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,850
spring of 2013 we experienced our own

275

<font color="#CCCCCC">wake-up call with regard to</font>

276
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:07,079
vulnerabilities that were brought to our

attention and needing to really

278
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,329
therefore engage with the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

that is somewhat different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we've</font>

281
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,220
had in the past and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by that</font>

282
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:26,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">is recognition that there's a need for</font>

of outreach on a topic that many of the

a complicated one because of the fact

292
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,969
that it's not just medical device

293

00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:39,470
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we were faced with that</font>

side the way that we have been

318
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:24,439
addressing a medical device security is

319
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:27,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">my messaging and socializing the</font>

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,690
security so for new devices new

329
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,850
deal with security and then bolted on

330
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:58,699
afterwards we know how challenging that

331
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:01,550
is and so in i guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was back in 2013</font>

332
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,670
2014 we had released what's called

338
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,209
story<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that that's half</font>

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,760
the story it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fraction of the story</font>

340
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger issue are all the devices</font>

market that many of them are what are

343
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,689
called legacy devices or devices that

344
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,690
were built at a time

349
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,890
day out more and more vulnerabilities

are being identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are emerging</font>

353
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:03,470
cannot do this alone and so we went on

354
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:04,640
this campaign of really engaging all of

355
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,880
the stakeholders within the ecosystem

356
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,140
and this was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much in parallel</font>

357
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,090
with efforts by the administration

358
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,280
through the issuance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of executive orders</font>

359
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,060
and presidential policy directives that

360
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,300
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain expectation or framework</font>

361
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,459
for what government regulatory agencies

362
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,699
working with a private sector could be

363
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,140
doing in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve or strengthing</font>

364
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,390
cybersecurity of critical infrastructure

365
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public health medical</font>

366
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:43,480
devices are part of that infrastructure

367
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:47,630
so we embarked on this journey to

368
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,300
understand all of the wands all of the

369
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:53,600
needs all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the challenges of the</font>

370
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,180
stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our ecosystem and in so</font>

371
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,300
doing it become<font color="#CCCCCC"> elms really really</font>

372
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">critical to bring the security</font>

373
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,698
researcher community into the fold and

374
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,359
to give the security researcher

375
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,730
community not only a voice to be heard

376
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,729
to be listened to to be paid attention

377
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:17,660
to but respect and a seat at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table</font>

378
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,750
and do recognize the value that<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

379
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:25,310
that security researchers provide by way

380
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,199
of expertise in working with the medical

381
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,970
device companies and working with the

382
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,010
government in understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

383
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,430
vulnerabilities are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we</font>

384
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be addressing them and</font>

385
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,660
addressing them in an expedient manner

386
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,190
in particular when they present concerns

387
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,110
for patient safety which is ultimately

388
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,160
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FDA is concerned about and</font>

389
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">outwitting what we're all concerned</font>

about

391
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:54,480
so we threw these efforts came to know I

<font color="#E5E5E5">quite an extraordinary partnership by</font>

security researcher community as

398
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,410
ambassadors to us for that and our being

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so far as to credit this type</font>

404
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,939
of engagement this close collaborating

405
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,470
and partnering with I am the cavalry and

406
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,880
with others with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the medical device</font>

407
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,040
manufacturers with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

408
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,630
delivery organizations but the the level

409
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,000
of engagement was so closely knit that

410
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,280
the guidance that we issued on<font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">market just a few months ago back in</font>

412
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:58,820
January 2016 was considered to be a

413
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:03,780
rather solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> or rather robust guidance</font>

414
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,879
and one that people across the entire

415
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,760
ecosystem could kind of nod to and say

416
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,380
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know this policy makes sense</font>

417
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,850
obviously there's tweaks it will have to

418
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,150
happen with the guidance as we finalize

419
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,189
it but what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we introduced</font>

420
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,740
concepts that are we believe are really

421
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,809
critical and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is co-ordinated</font>

422
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,000
disclosure the importance of coordinate

423
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,460
disclosure of researchers working

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,650
together with manufacturers working with

425
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,020
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> information sharing and analysis</font>

429
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,559

into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guidance recognize a recognized</font>

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,689
a cyber security perspective with these

439
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,100
standards in mind now I mean I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font>

440
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a very long time but I think I've</font>

441
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,899
already taken a lot of time so maybe we

442
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,290
think it addressed a little bit more

443
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,820
during whatever QA or people ism I think

444
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:27,180
a medical session often yes yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

445
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want</font>

446
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call out there that I think maybe</font>

447
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,030
people are modest and don't call out

448
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,790
themselves is you know as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

449
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:41,760
mentioned when the FDA was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

450
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,920
this stuff they they collaborated with

451
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,379
members of the research community which

452
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,120
you know all props and all power to to

453
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,760
the FDA for doing that that's a huge

454
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,370
thing it actually is creating a new

455
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:58,260
model and I think that they deserve a

456
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:00,959
round of applause which I can't do

457
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,870
holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a microphone the other thing is</font>

458
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,970
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people in this room who</font>

459
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:10,530
also participated that process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

460
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:12,390
influenced it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I from time</font>

461
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,540
to time I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard or seen people</font>

462
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">question what the cavalry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing to</font>

463
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,500
those people that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the cameras</font>

464
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,640
doing and that's where the strength is

465
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,760
its behind closed doors in in non show e

466
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,290
non ostentatious conversations but you

467
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,000
know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this room who</font>

468
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,440
had a real impact on that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

469
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,350
think that the FDA would acknowledge

470
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,510
they added value to the conversation and

471
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,580
I think that deserves to be acknowledged

472
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,120
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask you again to give a</font>

473
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,120
round of applause

474
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,029
but there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this was not</font>

475
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,169
everything on medical there were some

476
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:51,519
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to medical and</font>

477
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:52,779
josh is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and talk about</font>

478
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,730
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't know who josh is</font>

479
00:21:52,779 --> 00:22:06,340
then there's no point of me introducing

480
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:09,970
him I pro I promise not to yell I think

481
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:13,809
I'm supposed to hit the task force the

482
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,490
sea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill ok so there's give me more</font>

483
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,649
medical content throughout the two days

484
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">but for this chunk if you didn't see</font>

485
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,889
this morning there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one more thing I</font>

486
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,880
want to embarrass Suzanne a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

487
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:27,070
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about we you know we didn't get a</font>

488
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,980
long bio for her but when i first

489
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">started getting aware of this it was</font>

490
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like dr. kevin foo who had done</font>

491
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,389
some medical hacking it was Barnaby Jack

492
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:40,750
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we lost them it was Jay Radcliffe</font>

493
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:42,820
and and people had been trying to do

494
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they left very very frustrated</font>

495
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,980
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> they believed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the FDA type</font>

496
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:49,990
situation was intractable one of the

497
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,880
doctors yelled at<font color="#E5E5E5"> je at some point not</font>

498
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">an FDA person and saying there's no dead</font>

499
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,990
bodies this is academic and esoteric and

500
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,399
until there's proof of harm you know

501
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,980
real dead bodies we aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

502
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:02,709
anything and I kind of bought that

503
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,970
initially but meeting Suzanne I mean

504
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,549
she's a amazing equivalent peer to the

505
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,389
rebellious<font color="#CCCCCC"> no passion that we see in</font>

506
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:14,168
this community you know the FDA

507
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:15,729
government I think Frank said this one

508
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,820
it's a government moves really slowly

509
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:21,279
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are change agents and people</font>

510
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,889
that are just like us who are looking

511
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,000
for that teammate in us so if we can be

512
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,699
a teammate to them they will be a

513
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,779
teammate back so every time I talk to

514
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,480
her I get more impressed but she was a

515
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,730
trauma surgeon burn unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> specialists I</font>

516
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,010
mean every part of her fiber is about

517
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,289
saving<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives and now we have a new way</font>

518
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,940
to do it together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though we</font>

519
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,039
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would need dead bodies</font>

520
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,960
to see any significant change last

521
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,720
summer they issued a safety recall in

522
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hospital fusion pump with zero dead</font>

523
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,480
bodies zero proof of harm and they had

524
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,969
the presence of mind in the courage to

525
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,769
push in a pretty hard government

526
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,370
circumstance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really see that an</font>

527
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,040
unmitigated

528
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,840
pathway to harm is sufficient to trigger

529
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">corrective action we don't have to wait</font>

530
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,189
for calamity and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as much as I'm</font>

531
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really proud of the people in this room</font>

532
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that helped bring the security research</font>

have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing teammates so she's one</font>

535
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:20,710
of my heroes and I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people get</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fruit of this is</font>

538
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,360
we established us trust that Congress in

539
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,470
the SIS attacked of 2015<font color="#CCCCCC"> December which</font>

540
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,969
most of you know is the information

541
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing bill they had a provision in</font>

542
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,800
there asking HHS Health and Human

543
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,980
Services to do a one-year task force on

544
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity there were 20 people to be</font>

545
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,390
picked and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

546
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,450
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had them they wanted the researcher</font>

547
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:48,040
community to be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those 20 voices</font>

548
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,270
so michael mcneill who is up here

549
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier from philips</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's one of the</font>

550
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,820
large device manufacturers on the task

551
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,220
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was asked to represent the</font>

552
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,570
research community so people who have

553
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,010
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in healthcare delivery are doing</font>

554
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,570
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this if there's anything you</font>

555
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:05,710
want pulled into that process we have a

556
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:07,450
12 month assignment with six things we

557
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,220
owe to Congress HHS in the white house

558
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,600
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about halfway</font>

559
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,860
through and some of the stuff we're

560
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,320
going to cover tomorrow with the cameras

561
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,699
off are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really really really hard</font>

562
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,800
problems that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really really</font>

563
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,380
really concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think a</font>

564
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,230
critical linchpin in making<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hospital</font>

565
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,240
safe is making the devices more rugged

566
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,670
more resilient more defensible and I

567
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,559
think Suzanne's part of the universe has

568
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,010
been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful in raising the bar on</font>

569
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:34,570
individual medical devices in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition</font>

570
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,530
that this task<font color="#E5E5E5"> force is now looking at</font>

571
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,270
how do you make healthcare delivery

572
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,520
organizations it's still use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows XP</font>

573
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,250
and really old gear and don't have sis

574
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,970
owes and are wide open and naked to the

575
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet not in many cases would her</font>

576
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,320
work is very necessary but insufficient

577
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,700
for this other stuff so one of the

578
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,530
policy advances<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

579
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,160
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased to see is a that they have</font>

580
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,629
a focus on cybersecurity be it's an open

581
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,059
process and see that one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 20</font>

582
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,679
voices is basically us so if you weren't

583
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,000
aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> please loading you up or</font>

584
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,310
looking for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have pen tested</font>

HD OS who have clever or innovative

586
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,260
ideas we're looking for academics can

587
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,909
find more realistic ways to prevent a

588
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,080
tax and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the real big wake-up</font>

589
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,940
call for them was the Hollywood

590
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,649
Presbyterian Hospital losing its ability

591
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide patient care and the</font>

592
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,820
ransomware is just it's like shooting

593
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,649
fish in a barrel for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital's they</font>

594
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,270
just are not in a good position at all

595
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,440
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> missed this morning stuff</font>

596
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,120
we're going to dive in that a little bit

597
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,950
more tomorrow and the second thing is a

598
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">little less related but it's another</font>

599
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,420
good sign I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess just like in the</font>

600
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,399
private sector sometimes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciso</font>

601
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,380
reports to the CIO and is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of an inherent conflict of interest HHS</font>

603
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,120
there was a bill introduced to basically

604
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,610
give more power to the siso by stripping

605
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,810
it out from underneath the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO I don't</font>

606
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there was necessarily a structural</font>

607
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:55,389
problem but they said you know what the

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,800
operations and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity of a</font>

609
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,110

<font color="#E5E5E5">invited me to be a I guess I get my</font>

611
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,139
first congressional testimony I still

612
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:13,449
didn't do as well as Jen did for her her

613
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:15,100
toys but yeah yes so it's an

614
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,620
intimidating process and it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

615
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">work but but here's the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good the</font>

616
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,639
good news bad news is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

617
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,840
happen more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often so now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font>

618
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,960
starting to build trust relationships

619
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,419
with some of these key congressional

620
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,610
committees they don't all get hearings

621
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,220
but several<font color="#CCCCCC"> times almost like once a</font>

622
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">month at least there's an emergent topic</font>

623
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,330
where their members want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart on</font>

624
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,070
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to find like the</font>

625
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,939
world expert on Krypto that can actually

626
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:45,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to a congressperson like now so you</font>

627
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">might get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a phone call from me or from</font>

628
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">beau or something where we're not</font>

629
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,750
necessarily looking for the best crypto

630
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,490
person we're looking for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

631
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,600
translator and as they recognize how

632
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,860
dependent they are inside where we're

633
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,850
going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those muscles and</font>

634
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,100
we're not always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it right</font>

635
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:02,169
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always going to use right</font>

636
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,580
words that this community likes but I

637
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,240
think it's a good sign that we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

638
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,010
few now Dave<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kennedy yourself me we're</font>

639
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> establish ourselves that</font>

640
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,129
whenever there's a cyber topic they at

641
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,990
least might ask us our opinion so it

642
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,450
might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on camera on c-span but we</font>

643
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,100
are at least being asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for information</font>

644
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,600
I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a very good sign is</font>

645
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,600
that what you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

646
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,040
so yeah so there's lots happening in

647
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,440
medical anything remember how

648
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,940
microphones work at some point so that's

649
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,130
happening in medical and I think you

650
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,820
know the key takeaway here is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

651
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:46,390
seeing progress which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

652
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:50,809
so on to transport and self-driving cars

653
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:52,880
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I appreciate it so there's a lot</font>

654
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:55,370
going on and transport as well and not

655
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,110
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of cars although cars</font>

656
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,239
obviously make a lot of headlines on a

657
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,309
regular basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there are a lot of</font>

658
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,390
things happening there so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

659
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,559
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some car stuff and then</font>

660
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:09,320
Amanda's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

661
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:11,750
aviation stuff so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few things</font>

662
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:16,159
that have happened so one has anybody

663
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:21,070
heard of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan car bill all right</font>

664
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:25,429
a few um so Michigan introduced a

665
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:32,840
proposal for a state bill and it would

666
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:35,330
have made it an offence to to access the

667
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,199
the computer systems in a car without

668
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,360
permission from the manufacturer which

669
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,480
again kind of makes research pretty

670
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,969
illegal so this was introduced by the

671
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,030
Senate Majority in I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and</font>

672
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,620
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my timing right on this April end of</font>

673
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,030
April and then like very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly</font>

674
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,309
there was there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> response from the</font>

675
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:00,920
community so a bunch of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> coalition of</font>

676
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:03,800
researchers and people from the security

677
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,760
community responded in private in a

678
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,129
letter and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey super concerning</font>

679
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,540
your you're basically making research

680
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,350
legal and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointed to the fact</font>

681
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,220
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been some instances of</font>

682
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,990
published car research that's been very

683
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable and that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

684
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,910
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about lives here and got a</font>

685
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,730
really great level of engagement from

686
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:27,080
from the bill's sponsors so they came

687
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,580
back and they said okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sounds</font>

688
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,620
serious we should consider it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

689
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,379
talk let's chat and there's been some

690
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,478
back and forth and

691
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:38,779
the proposed changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

692
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at making would make it that the</font>

693
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:43,309
car's owner can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> acts it can give</font>

694
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:47,539
permission to somebody to access the

695
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:52,369
systems and their defining owner to

696
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:55,190
include like a what's the right word for

697
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,649
this lessee is that the right word yep

698
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,330
so so it's much broader now and it would

699
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:04,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean that i can give access to you to do</font>

700
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:07,099
work on it as a researcher they are

701
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:09,139
reconvening<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think tomorrow is when the</font>

702
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:11,570
the state legislation legislature comes

703
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,789
back and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know when the bill</font>

704
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,889
will be reintroduced but we do expect

705
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:19,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it will be introduced with updated</font>

706
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:21,080
language so again yay for researchers

707
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:25,669
collaborating and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moving this</font>

708
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:29,359
forward then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a couple of things</font>

709
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:32,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen on a federal level and one</font>

710
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,649
of them was a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can never remember</font>

711
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:37,219
the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I always refer to as</font>

712
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:43,189
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitsuba which is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is no</font>

713
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:48,009
the other one yeah the national highway

714
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:51,649
whatever was so this was proposed

715
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:53,330
beginning of the year and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had</font>

716
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:57,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you never said it would be a</font>

717
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:59,089
federal offense to access the computer

718
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,909
systems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car without the</font>

719
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:03,019
permission of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturer again</font>

720
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,879
there was a strong response from the

721
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:09,859
community this actually did have a

722
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:12,738
hearing and and so there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the</font>

723
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:15,259
Commerce Committee had a hearing and

724
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:18,409
they they called in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nitzer and some</font>

725
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:20,299
other people various auto<font color="#E5E5E5"> alliance type</font>

726
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and they kind of went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through it</font>

727
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:23,029
and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were some questions that were</font>

728
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,499
asked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee hearing about</font>

729
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,320
researchers and what the impact would be

730
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:31,369
and generally speaking like the feeling

731
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,168
is the bill is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move and if</font>

732
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,908
it does move then the language around

733
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:39,349
this particular piece will be changed

734
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:40,369
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapted and so again it looks like</font>

735
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,689
we're making the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of progress</font>

736
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:44,418
because there is a high level of

737
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">engagement so at the moment I mean like</font>

738
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:47,720
I think you guys are probably all away

739
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing much is likely to move in</font>

740
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,390
Congress<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year there's kind of some</font>

741
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,799
other stuff going on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing's moving</font>

742
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,029
anytime soon but the question is like

743
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,960
when we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement we're</font>

744
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,149
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's going to happen</font>

745
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,240
next year what will be reintroduced what

746
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:03,559
might have legs and so the engagement

747
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,019
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at driving is really</font>

748
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:07,340
about how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve things so that</font>

749
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:11,149
when they get picked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year</font>

750
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,049
there'll be less damaging and so it

751
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like we're going in the right</font>

752
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:16,220
direction with that stuff so then the

753
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:18,860
third one is as just mentioned the spike

754
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:24,110
our act there's a semi to<font color="#CCCCCC"> marquis bill</font>

755
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:25,699
it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year was last year and</font>

756
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:31,939
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in the early part of last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year's</font>

757
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:34,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">as old and spy car stands for security</font>

758
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,639
and privacy in your car for your car act

759
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,760
and it is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sort of measures</font>

760
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:44,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> automotive manufacturers can</font>

761
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:49,100
introduce to advanced security or

762
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:51,019
improve privacy in automobiles again

763
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,459
super unlikely to move there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

764
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">good things in it and some questionable</font>

765
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,899
things and that is generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

766
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,299
with legislation and legislative

767
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:02,689
proposals so it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging and</font>

768
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:03,889
educating if you are interested in

769
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,870
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you should take a look</font>

770
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:08,149
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reach out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some smokies</font>

771
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,489
office but they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been talking a lot</font>

772
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,279
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the community they've been</font>

773
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:15,080
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ocean motor manufacturers</font>

774
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,339
and as I said like some of the stuff

775
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,239
that they're proposing is actually

776
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,119
pretty cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be very</font>

777
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,168
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

778
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,270
but then there's also things like

779
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,799
there's a pen testing requirement that

780
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,629
seems a little like it may not be very

781
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,639
practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to do the car the</font>

782
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,168
stickers that say how secure you are I

783
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,460
don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would work in</font>

784
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:36,020
practice but I kind of like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

785
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">it because and I think it gets consumers</font>

786
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,440
into a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view of thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

787
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,270
security and having an expectation of

788
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,560
security information which we don't have

789
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,830
today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that improves</font>

790
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,940
security awareness I am a fan of but

791
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,730
it's really unlikely to move anytime

792
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:53,030
soon so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what's</font>

793
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,699
happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Karl and that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

794
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,550
stuff and again like there are people in

795
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,040
this room who have heavily participated

796
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,410
in moving

797
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,090
all three of those bills on in terms of

798
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,089
the language if not like the bills

799
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:07,350
actually moving so again if you're one

800
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those people you should give yourself</font>

801
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:14,700
a big pat on the back because that's

802
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:16,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome work I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just highlight a</font>

803
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,620
couple of developments in the aviation

804
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,900
industry the major development was this

805
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,420
year very recent in the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

806
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,290
actually but I'll start in September

807
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,730
2014 which is when the aviation

808
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,190
information sharing and analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

809
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:35,300
or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac was established it's just an</font>

810
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">indication that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aviation companies are</font>

811
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,600
aware of this issue are recognizing

812
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,549
there's a need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share information and</font>

813
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,580
to get a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

814
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">security threat and then in 2015 I'm</font>

815
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,290
sure as you're all aware there are lots

816
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,450
of things that happened to increase

817
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">awareness of the threat of cyber</font>

818
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:58,439
security and in the aviation space so

819
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:02,580
there was the the instance of Chris and

820
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,000
the United tweet there was an instance

821
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a Polish airliner being brought down</font>

822
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,140
there was the in what happened in the

823
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,420
Malaysia airline crash and then there

824
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,450
was also something called a government

825
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,360
accountability office report GAO report

826
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:22,169
which highlighted that the the Federal

827
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:25,020
Aviation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Administration or FAA did not</font>

828
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:28,010
have sufficient security and place to

829
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,110
protect airline traffic control systems

830
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,350
so in the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fall of 2015 there was</font>

831
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,790
a lot of interest among politicians of

832
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,089
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addressing this issue</font>

833
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:41,820
and then this past<font color="#E5E5E5"> spring the the</font>

834
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:45,780
Federal Aviation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Administration or FAA</font>

835
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,000
reauthorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act was introduced in</font>

836
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,420
April and what the the reauthorization

837
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,920
act basically does is it extends the

838
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,950
mandate and the funding for the FAA and

839
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,020
it was just finalized mid-july and

840
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,029
signed in mid-july it extends the

841
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,340
mandate in the funding of the FAA for

842
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:07,020
another 14 months then we'll revisit all

843
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,300
these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the really important</font>

844
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,420
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

845
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:16,490
part of the the reauthorization bill

846
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:20,250
required that the FAA take a look at at

847
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:22,470
reducing cyber secure or cyber risks to

848
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:26,160
aviation systems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the civil aviation</font>

849
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:30,109
systems and gave the the FAA just 240

850
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,609
days to come back and report a framework

851
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,160
policies principles of how they were

852
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help reduce risk and a couple</font>

853
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,890
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that were</font>

854
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,230
specifically called out was thinking

855
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,940
about reducing risks in-flight

856
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,670
entertainment systems and to the air

857
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,650
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> control systems and then the</font>

858
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,630
same time that that FAA reauthorization

859
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,720
bill was introduced in April this year

860
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:57,330
there was a bill introduced the cyber

861
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">air act by Ed Markey at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marquee a from</font>

Massachusetts the senator from

Massachusetts and it was purposefully

864
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,840
timed at the same time as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FAA</font>

reauthorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contains some of</font>

866
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same ideas that there needs to be</font>

867
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,040
some sort of cyber security guidelines

868
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,140
for aviation that there should be

870
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,279
incidents to the government and that

871
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">there needs to be a serious thought and</font>

872
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:25,440
for the infotainment systems for how to

873
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:27,030
secure those so that that bill is kind

874
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,400
of been set aside it's in committee

875
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,920
which means it's being considered it

876
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,830
could eventually make it to the floor it

877
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,940
could not but that has been presented to

878
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,940
help move the conversation forward

879
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:49,650
actually think you're next yes nope what

880
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:52,169
yeah so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I I'll do the White House</font>

881
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:57,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">grandville okay so there's there's been</font>

882
00:38:52,170 --> 00:39:01,170
a few things again in infrastructure I'm

883
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:03,570
sort of mindful of time there is a bill

884
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was introduced by senators Graham</font>

885
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,050
and white house it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally called</font>

886
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,520
to the international cyber crime

887
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,990
prevention act and it was introduced

888
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:15,390
last summer and then it was abbreviated

889
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,569
down and proposed as a member of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:20,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisa which did not move ahead and then</font>

891
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,430
it got reintroduce this year as the

892
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,690
botnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prevention Act and they're still</font>

893

verse

895
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,229
next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it basically does a bunch</font>

896
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,199
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things around law</font>

enforcement authorities for computer

898

crimes and one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that it</font>

899
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:40,390
does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks to update some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

penalties for computer crimes against

902
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,779
critical infrastructure that's pretty

903
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:49,049
much what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does in relation to</font>

904
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:51,099
critical infrastructure it's that and

905
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:52,239
it's not more complicate on that you

906
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,679
guys should<font color="#CCCCCC"> check it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out but it's likely</font>

907
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:55,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be reintroduced next year in some</font>

prevent the botnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prevention Act if you</font>

910

want to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it</font>

911
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:11,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay cuz off are all familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

912
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:13,869
NIST cybersecurity framework yes just a

913
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,489
very quick update on that as I'm sure

914
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,279
you're all very aware there have been

915
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:20,079
numerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfis but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before the framework</font>

916
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:21,909
was finalized and since the framework

917
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,749
has been finalized the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent ones</font>

918
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:28,869
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December of 2015 last year and that</font>

919
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:30,459
RFI was basically asking again about how

920
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:33,640
organizations are using the framework

921
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:35,459
but also more forward thinking you know

922
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,140
how should the framework be revised

923
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:40,538
should miss continue to have the role

924
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's had or should the framework</font>

925
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:48,939
move to another place and so as a result

926
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:51,759
of that RFI response and a workshop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

927
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:53,979
NIST hosted in April they are updating

928
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:56,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">the framework and so they are working</font>

929
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:58,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the pieces that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were the</font>

930
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:00,879
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they received and things</font>

931
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:03,009
that need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> updated or added like</font>

932
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,419
there have been there's been some

933
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:07,929
attention around the sub cyber supply

934
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:09,308
chain risk management being added so

935
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:12,130
updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> are changes to the</font>

936
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:13,539
implementation tears<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen Ellis wrote</font>

937
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,549
that they needed to think about having

938
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,549
vulnerability disclosure best practices

939
00:41:17,969 --> 00:41:23,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes and so that's going to be happening</font>

940
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:25,839
through the foam and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan right</font>

941
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:30,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">now is that they'll release a draft</font>

942
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,299
update early next year for comment

943
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,348
think i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one is allen</font>

944
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,730
he's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

945
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:43,339
home stuff thank you and i know we've

946
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,190
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of praises about the kaveri i</font>

947
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:49,599
will just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that washington for better</font>

948
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,000
worse often depends on outside experts

949
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,460
special interest as they're known and

950
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,200
often they get a bad rap but really you

951
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,769
know the expertise comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

952
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,180
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes from civil society and</font>

953
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:04,368
washington has dedicated people who care

00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">about privacy who care about encryption</font>

955
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:08,990
there are lots of civil society people

956
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,808
who really<font color="#CCCCCC"> help us understand the core</font>

957
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:15,950
values<font color="#E5E5E5"> there hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been people who</font>

958
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:17,329
really say cyber safety is a social

959
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,950
value that we all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work for and</font>

960
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,990
and the cavalry<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been a really</font>

961
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,210
incredible resource for those of us in

962
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:24,828
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> who want to need the</font>

information in order to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in build</font>

964
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:30,230

Commerce we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when markets work</font>

966
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,819
when people get to buy and build and

967
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,348
innovate<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe in slightly different</font>

968

00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,279
where you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the department we're</font>

970
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:43,579
not a regulator but we're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

971
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:45,710
promoting a better markets for security

972
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:49,579
so just today we announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

973
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:51,799
initiative on IOT security starting with

974
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the premise that it's very hard for</font>

975
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:55,730
consumers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what to look for in</font>

976
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,368
security you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really go to a smart</font>

977
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,230
TV and say gosh did they use a besom

978
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:03,049
secure development lifecycle process

979
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,059
when they built my smart TV but there

980
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:07,849
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we can start we can say</font>

981
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:09,619
does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device support security</font>

982
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:12,019
upgrade ability can this device be

983
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:14,869
patched the problem is there isn't

984
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:17,779
really a universal definition of what it

985
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:21,259
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be patchable in smart devices</font>

986
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:23,119
it's a multi-dimensional problem and so

987
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:24,769
we are launching a multi-stakeholder

988
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,009
process to bring the other security

989
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:30,470
experts device<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacturers device</font>

990
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:32,180
integrators those are responsible

991
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,430
connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of devices and saying let's</font>

992
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,558
talk about the many dimensions that we

993
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,609
care about four patch ability whether

994
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,019
it's the user experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whether it's</font>

995
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:43,490
authentication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices or whether</font>

996
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,970
it's how long this device is going to be

997
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,279
patched

998
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,410
and let's build a taxonomy and then from

999
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that develop a much smaller set of</font>

1000
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,899
definitions that consumers can<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1001
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,820
about to look at to work with say

1002
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Consumer Reports</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says I should look for</font>

1003
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">these words on the label and that</font>

1004
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,720
manufacturers now have some specific

1005
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,570
goals to work towards to actually

1006
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,220
demonstrate to their board or to their

1007
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:11,390
cost counters oh we can get a return on

1008
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,209
security investment by making these

1009
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,920
products better this is voluntary we're

1010
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,080
not saying everyone needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

1011
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,060
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it voluntary we believe</font>

1012
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get active participation</font>

1013
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,450

that really affects everyone so thank

handling one of the criticisms that came

from the communities that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1073
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,630
enough researchers participating so I

1074
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,160
really hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys will take the</font>

1075
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,230
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's</font>

1076
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,470
not sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in person of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the meetings</font>

1077
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:02,579
get on the phone listening your voice

1078
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:04,740
can only be heard if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lend it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1079
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,920
we're gonna whoa running out battery

1080
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:12,839
that's good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to refer</font>

1081
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so how do you get engaged the big</font>

1082
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:20,430
hint here is not like this nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes</font>

1083
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,420
a flaming torch except<font color="#E5E5E5"> the British when</font>

1084
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,538
they're burning down the White House and

1085
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:29,480
so don't do that that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

1086
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:31,650
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the the main thing is really</font>

1087
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,020
to talk to people who are already

1088
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:37,020
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some way find out how you</font>

1089
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,299
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved through them most</font>

1090
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:44,609
people will try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you get started</font>

1091
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:46,200
in a way that doesn't blow up look

1092
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:49,380
for common opportunities there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1093
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:52,700
opportunities through forums like the

1094
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,779
nth a process which are looking to have

1095
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,450
organizations individuals participate

1096
00:47:54,779 --> 00:48:00,630
and open sort of voluntary process there

1097
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:02,578
are also required comet opportunities as

1098
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,619
part of the implementation of

1099
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,850
legislative law and I by an

1100
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,560
administrative by an agency that's

1101

administrative loss they are required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> open comment periods on their</font>

1103
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,720
rulemaking and so there's an opportunity

1104
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,190
to influence how an agency implements a

1105
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,810
statue<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for the next one and the</font>

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,100
at all and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can I wish I could remember</font>

1109
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:32,020
what it was called and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped</font>

1110
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:35,839
mentioning it sir because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel bad now</font>

1111
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:38,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that bill was a great example of people</font>

1112
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,580
identifying hey this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the</font>

1113
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,320
Commerce Committee so let's reach out to

1114
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:44,660
staffers who are on the Commerce

1115
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,000
Committee and tell them what we're

1116
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,759
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and that led to questions</font>

1117
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's a hearings that gets</font>

1118
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,590
announced you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the committee</font>

1119
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,300
members and reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to their offices</font>

1120
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:59,800
and you can basically so many

1121
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,800
suggestions or questions for hearings

1122
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,600
and they need them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay our here over</font>

1123
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,920
here I give us like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know them a</font>

1124
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,020
chance to it or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they have a</font>

1125
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,120
submission questions typically typically

1126
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,740
money for out here for the hearing so so

1127
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,080
that's no nothing everything like you

1128
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to get you a climbing climbing for</font>

1135
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:39,470
works and requires coordination it

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it really doesn't kind of</font>

1139
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:49,369
there's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know some people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">who are really engaged and pushing the</font>

1142
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:58,249
this year and they they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have made a</font>

1147
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:07,880
it happens you have to be coordinated

1148
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:10,910
you have to actually do it you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

a form letter back but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say there</font>

1152
00:50:14,869 --> 00:50:19,970
about in some way so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your</font>

1153
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:22,009
rep and a topic they're already

1154
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,089
interested in so I'm in Massachusetts so

1155
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:25,029
the fact the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marquee is already looking</font>

1156
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,950
a lot of the stuff it's helpful for me

1157
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:29,660
the second option<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1158
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,729
other people who care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to a</font>

1159
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:35,598
coalition letter will always have more

1160
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:37,160
impact and a coalition of businesses

1161
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,920
based on the area will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more</font>

1162
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,140
impact so that's that's basically the

1163
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,940
gist on how you approach that and the

1164
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the FF has a great action</font>

1165
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,729
center it's all described on their

1166
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:48,729
website they give you ideas of how to

1167
00:50:46,729 --> 00:50:51,140
get involved you should check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out</font>

1168
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:53,779
we are racing<font color="#E5E5E5"> against my battery right</font>

1169
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,969
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

1170
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:58,219
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> outreach again not burning torches</font>

1171
00:50:55,969 --> 00:51:00,200
and pitchforks not super helpful the

1172
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:02,569
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for staffers is they want</font>

1173
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,640
and ask the first thing they'll say to

1174
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:07,279
you when you sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down with them is what</font>

1175
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,009
can we do for you and apparently when

1176
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:13,339
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say blow up the CFAA that's not a</font>

1177
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:15,440
good answer but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a clear idea</font>

1178
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:17,089
when you go in of what your goal is and

1179
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,529
have a clear idea of how you're going to

1180
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:20,328
speak to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like what is the story</font>

1181
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:22,789
you're going to tell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps them</font>

1182
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:25,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand it the first time I went to</font>

1183
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:27,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">DC I went and I was like it's terrible</font>

1184
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:31,269
security researchers are being oppressed

1185
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:33,619
we must do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I realized that</font>

1186
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:36,589
effectively at day I went was the day

1187
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:37,880
the healthcare.gov fell over and Obama

1188
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:38,270
went on TV and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when yeah I didn't know</font>

1189
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,330
it wasn't

1190
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">King and so all of the dems we met with</font>

1191
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,529
were watching the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> go holy and</font>

1192
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:47,060
all the reps we met wares were watching

1193
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,340
the TV rubbing their hands with glee and

1194
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,500
laughing maniacally and it was a really

1195
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,600
great learning because the key here is

1196
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're super busy by the way the next</font>

1197
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">time i went was the big immigration</font>

1198
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:59,690
thing with the kids the border and then

1199
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,760
the second the next time with Ebola so

1200
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:03,770
big lesson for me here is like these

1201
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are busy they have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

1202
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:09,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and the first several times I</font>

1203
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,540
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk I realized that what I was</font>

1204
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:13,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically saying to them is hey we need</font>

1205
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a rocket ship and fly to the</font>

1206
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,380
moon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were going what's the moon</font>

1207
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,790
and so you need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy</font>

1208
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,070
for them and that is not being

1209
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,990
dismissive right like they're experts in

1210
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:26,900
policy they know that I will never

1211
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,700
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is their job it is not their</font>

1212
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,400
job to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts in security research</font>

1213
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,870
it is not their experts to be their job

1214
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,180
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be experts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in any of the stuff we</font>

1215
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,950
deal with that is our job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our job</font>

1216
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:39,230
is to make it easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

1217
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,850
understand and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create that</font>

1218
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,580
quid pro quo they will meet you halfway

1219
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,500
so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your story is before</font>

1220
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,450
you go in be really clear on how to make

1221
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:51,050
it simple for them make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple for</font>

1222
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:52,640
yourself and for them part of building

1223
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,270
your story is doing your research<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1224
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,900
course and and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we mean you no</font>

1225
00:52:55,270 --> 00:53:01,100
talking to others with like that are

1226
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,390
representing different pieces of the

1227
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,150
puzzle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to build and</font>

1228
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:06,650
bring and bring to them so bring them

1229
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,900
from my perspective that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1230
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,250
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> go talk to the engineers for yours</font>

1231
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,560
it might mean that you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down</font>

1232
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">with someone who has done this policy</font>

1233
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">step before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get a sense of how you</font>

1234
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,430
would go about having an ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1235
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,590
going to going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be relevant</font>

1236
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:23,569
for the individually or sitting down and

1237
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:28,220
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it yeah it's loaded</font>

1238
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:31,430
with so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not cool</font>

1239
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:33,230
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys to be suck-ups or to be</font>

1240
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,520
obsequious or to say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that isn't</font>

1241
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:37,040
true like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you shouldn't be on in</font>

1242
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,960
authentic or just Ingenuus however if

1243
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,410
you see people do something that is

1244
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,090
genuinely good recognize it if the FDA

1245
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:46,220
comes out with post-market guidance

1246
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good thing tell them</font>

1247
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:51,240
that that is awesome be encouraging

1248
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,160
because other people are much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1249
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,410
want to emulate it if they see again a

1250
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,270
positive response we're really good in

1251
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:59,399
this community pointing out the things

1252
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:01,950
that are broken and we're terrible

1253
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">appointing other things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not so</font>

1254
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:10,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a big one to do related</font>

1255
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:13,260
providing actual actionable feedback is

1256
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:15,690
acknowledging that even if you totally

1257
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,300
disagree with every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single thing in a</font>

00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:20,490
bill or something rekik try to recognize

1259
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,650
where that it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from and that</font>

1260
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,879
it's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve something that</font>

1261
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,310
from the perspective the person writing

1262
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,420
it is a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and then really</font>

1263
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,070
figure out how to help that person

1264
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand you know from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1265
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:34,080
perspective why that path is not the way

1266
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,029
to get to the end that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good and then</font>

1267
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,160
provide very actual feedback for how

1268
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,960
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that's that's not</font>

1269
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">good that's not right is not enough you</font>

1270
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,500
need to be constructive and show them

1271
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,618
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to where they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1272

a basic human thing and frankly if you
