1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so next up we have Gabriel Bassett</font>

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:11,519
and Anastasia<font color="#CCCCCC"> atanasov from verizon</font>

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:19,710
there on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dbi our team so put your</font>

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:22,320
hands together<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're not going</font>

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,730
to be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the DVI our report</font>

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,550
in fact we're not even be talking about

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,710
the data in the DB I report this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about the process it goes in</font>

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,030
to the data so that the data janitor

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,949
work right it's like eighty percent of

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,750
the data scientists work is you know

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,160
cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and preparing the data and the</font>

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">other twenty percent is complaining</font>

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,940
about how the data isn't clean enough

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,590
and so if by the way I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">apologize ahead of time this is a really</font>

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,410
high content per minute talk it's very

18
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,969
dense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and frankly the slides are not</font>

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,029
that good they're kind of boring there's

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,370
just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of words don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at them</font>

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,170
we're much better to look at like we're

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,870
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard on the eyes so look at us</font>

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,550
listen to us it's a lot better and so

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,450
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to do this top is</font>

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,649
kind of threefold first this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,390
something that people normally talk

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,040
about like we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the models we</font>

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,600
created the cool things and how well

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,460
they did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't talk about all the</font>

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,789
process we did to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data where it</font>

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,130
needs to be second we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,900
happy will understand how we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,490
number so that when you read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DVI are</font>

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,080
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> import you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

35
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,820
number and understand the process that

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">went into getting to that number and</font>

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,990
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those people who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

38
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,669
are new to data science we wanted to

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of give them an exhibit an idea of</font>

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,750
here's what happens in reality with data

41
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">sciences here's what they spend all</font>

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,750
their time on data wats<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they clean</font>

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,970
in the entire process behind it and so

44
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,009
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is really its agenda but</font>

45
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,229
it's also the data flow it's what the

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,060
prop the process our data goes through

47
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,929
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,950
how we store the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think we're</font>

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,340
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how we store the</font>

50
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,899
data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are we started a git repo</font>

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,520
and it just kind of lives there and so

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,270
unless we mentioned otherwise that's

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,679
where all the stuff is happening

54
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:12,010
and so like other skip the formula stuff

55
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,989
I'm the mad scientist I'm Anastasia

56
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,910
atanasoff I'm a data scientist I have

57
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,340
background in security and pure and

58
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,840
applied mathematics I one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,670
co-authors of the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I do</font>

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,019
exploratory and statistical analysis on

61
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,089
the data yeah i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should point out</font>

62
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:32,920
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am not at a station of gabriel in case</font>

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,870
there was any to us and so talking about

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the report if you aren't familiar with</font>

65
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,040
it it's a report<font color="#E5E5E5"> on like a hundred</font>

66
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,410
thousand incidents that happen each year

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know the goal is for it to be</font>

68
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,180
data-driven we want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done to</font>

69
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,429
academic rigor but we'd give it a really

70
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,560
cheeky voice so that it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font>

71
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,450
to read because it's a report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,450
reports on a fun to review and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,829
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you told me</font>

74
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,569
before it was on so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I would</font>

75
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:08,650
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor off switches okay</font>

76
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,369
should I go back now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go</font>

77
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,319
back I'm not doing it so okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

78
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the first thing we kind of think</font>

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,850
about is what's data right and the clear

80
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,310
way to answer that is to google it and

81
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,920
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is kind of what we know</font>

82
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,470
data to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's something that's</font>

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,030
solid it's unchanging it looks the same

84
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,950
from every single angle by the way do

85
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,380
you know you can buy a ball of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Onyx on</font>

86
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,209
ebay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for five bucks and get delivered</font>

87
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,799
from China in like three days like

88
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,819
that's impressive i thought it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

89
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">like looking for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ball and i thought</font>

90
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:40,690
was gonna get like some concrete thing

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,790
and like I got this ball of Onyx I feel

92
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,069
like I probably stole it from some

93
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,459
ancient uh you know museum or something

94
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,500
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of what we</font>

95
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,660
we know like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition that</font>

96
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">we know but reality is we this is what</font>

97
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,130
we feel data is like is it's a puzzle

98
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece and when we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at we don't</font>

99
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,989
really know where it fits or you know

100
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,899
what it means but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're confident</font>

101
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,560
that if we analyze it and figure out its

102
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,510
place in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> puzzle we can put this</font>

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,259
together and come up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture that</font>

104
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,599
really conveys some knowledge now

105
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,519
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what data looks</font>

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,229
like

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,079
this is the floor of my record I mean

108
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">not my rec room it's my kids well no</font>

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,870
it's actually both we share the rec room

110
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,509
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my toys and so when we</font>

111
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze data its reality is a bunch of</font>

112
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,530
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't actually fit together</font>

113
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,830
like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not designed to easily</font>

114
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:42,388
connect and so part of our job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

115
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,008
make the pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit together also they</font>

116
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit together in many ways right with</font>

117
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,580
a puzzle<font color="#E5E5E5"> only fits together one way you</font>

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,800
only get one picture out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it you know</font>

119
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> playing with duplos you can</font>

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,470
build anything you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can build a</font>

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,509
car or a boat or car boat you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

122
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with a ever picture you want and so</font>

123
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we need to talk about our</font>

124
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:04,229
methodology talk about our<font color="#CCCCCC"> process is so</font>

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,229
that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the pieces together</font>

126
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,610
into a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do it in a repeatable</font>

127
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,949
verifiable maintainable manner and

128
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,840
preferably move from a manual process

129
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,810
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can introduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heirs to an</font>

130
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,789
automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> process and so the first step</font>

131
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,710
is getting in preparing the day I'm

132
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hand it over to Anna to do that</font>

133
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:25,109
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so when we get the</font>

134
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,759
data we always look for a very robust

135
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,889
and diverse data set<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we make</font>

136
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,240
continuous effort to recruit partners

137
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,909
from all over the world with various

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,919
focuses and we also want to maintain a

139
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:38,099
good working<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship with current</font>

140
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,568
partners from year to year so these

141
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,539

142
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:45,330
some sort of bias as bias is inherent in

143
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,949
any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of research it's not</font>

144
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,719
dichotomous so it could occur in any

145
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,960
phase of research whether it be planning

146
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,490
data collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis or reporting</font>

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,650
because it's independent of sample size

148
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> variance you do have to care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

149
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,539
random error as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always a</font>

150
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,830
good idea to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

151
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,539
types of bias that you may encounter

152
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,750
during your research such a selection

153
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:12,479
bias detection exclusion bias or even

154
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:14,969
observer bias so we consider the

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,860
bias-variance trade-off and then with

156
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:18,539
random error that's when it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

157
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,789
idea to start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into hypothesis</font>

158
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,360
testing and we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into our confidence</font>

159
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:26,729
intervals so some potential partners may

160
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,020
not meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data standards so this is</font>

161
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,270
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will review and assist in their</font>

162
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,490
data collection methods if<font color="#CCCCCC"> knee</font>

163
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,289
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> also every partner stores that our</font>

164
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,880
data in their own way so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is</font>

165
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,370
we provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with the standard excel</font>

166
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,750
file for them to use or we give them a

167
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,050
web form for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter their data</font>

168
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,930
into and then we take the various you

169
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,300
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> xls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CSV text file or whatever and</font>

170
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,020
we hand convert it into standard excel

171
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,030
in order to maintain consistency so for

172
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,830
those cases when we receive non-standard

173
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,260
source data what we do is we build

174
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,539
mappings / partner so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> take their</font>

175
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,080
enumerations and we map them to ours and

176
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,520
we reuse these mappings each year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,109
then also to complete some of those

178
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,270
mappings we actually have to hand code

179
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,730
various features such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding an aches</font>

180
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,770
codes for industries and do any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

181
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,670
necessary conversion such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps</font>

182
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,680
in order to maintain that consistency so

183
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,380
many times data is missing complimentary

184
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,210
encodings so we either manually edit or

185
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,310
we use heuristic rules using a script

186
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,440
for example if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an incident</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

187
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,380

188
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,660

189
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,159
also add an asset assets that web app

190
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,920
into that record in order to help

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">complete the data if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is missing</font>

192
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,610
data we contact the partner see if they

193
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,470
can provide it if not we automatically

194
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,930
add in the required field as we put

195
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,450
unknown in that required field also

196
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">because data is anonymize we do add data</font>

197
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,500
to account for traceability so for

198
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,240
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are fields that the</font>

199
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,570
partner does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide but we add in</font>

200
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,650
such as DB<font color="#E5E5E5"> ireo source or master ID in</font>

201
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,650
order to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that traceability</font>

202
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,729
sometimes we have to remove things from

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,190
raw data for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the</font>

204
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,350
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and we have to ensure that</font>

205
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually deemed an incident how we</font>

206
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,920
define an incident is that it is a

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,180
security event that compromises<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

208
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,270
confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity and</font>

209
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,740
availability of an asset so we don't

210
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">include things that are not compromised</font>

211
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,540
there's no impact or if it's just

212
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,370
informational we also remove unintended

213
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,890
duplication for those cases where a

214
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">where an incident can be represent to</font>

215
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:34,130
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raw data we also</font>

216
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,140
remove already aggregated data for

217
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,789
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file and it just</font>

218
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,380
has counts by industry or accounts by

219
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,439
attack type or accounts by data type

220
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,689
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to make end of</font>

221
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,460
correlations with the aggregated data

222
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,440
because we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to the</font>

223
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,480
individual incidents so we make a habit

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,890
of reaching out to our partners and

225
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,750
requesting that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

226
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:56,290
aggregated data and the actual

227
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,510
individual records so for storing data

228
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,099
we have three main directories where we

229
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,170
have our source data first<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data and</font>

230
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,570
reviewed data for a source data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

231
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,449
our original unchanged raw data we never

232
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,210
delete it and we always keep copies for

233
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">each iteration we have our first past</font>

234
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,470
data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we just put the data</font>

235
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:19,240
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DB ir format so our collection</font>

236
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,010
well I'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later so the</font>

237
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,130
data is examined and then is prepared

238
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,439
for import and then for review data we

239
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,210
just take that first pass data we review

240
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for completeness and then it's ready</font>

241
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,980
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> import so typically we have a couple</font>

242
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,329
members of the team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look at the</font>

243
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,090
review data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that it's</font>

244
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,290
consistent from this year compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

245
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,790
previous years and that we're actually

246
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:44,709
working off the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> dataset next we</font>

247
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,500
convert the data into<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON which is what</font>

248
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,360
our schema is built upon so we use CSVs

249
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,530
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to play around with</font>

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,030
worksheets we don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play around</font>

251
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,550
with programming language<font color="#E5E5E5"> parsers or</font>

252
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,510
anything like that we use import scripts

253
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,150
to convert input CSV to JSON so each CSV

254
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:03,670
is unique and it requires its own import

255
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,829
script overall we have three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

256
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python conversion scripts to import</font>

257
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,760
those formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem with these</font>

258
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,250
scripts is that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been written by</font>

259
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,990
multiple authors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

260
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,450
run into consistency challenges where

261
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,070
it's sometimes hard to maintain so one

262
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,630
solution that we implemented was that we

263
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,750
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> module eyes those import</font>

264
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,610
scripts we remove common portions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

265
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,460
separate modules using heuristic rules

266
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,980
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a single control script</font>

267
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,300
that we where we import all the modules

268
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,630
and then run the actual conversion

269
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,310
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I get picturing do you like</font>

270
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,110
the animation it took me a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to</font>

271
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,060
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's the</font>

272
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chart like I promised I</font>

273
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,979
didn't like animate from here on out

274
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,540
it's all animations so no we don't need

275
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a whole lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the schema</font>

276
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,360
right because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be</font>

277
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,949
talking about the data but what we do

278
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,970
need to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the schema is</font>

279
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,980
what it

280
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,899
means for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure of the data and</font>

281
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we need a schema that could bring in</font>

282
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,709
both structured and unstructured data

283
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:05,889
right because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have data out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sims</font>

284
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:07,569
there's very structured tabular data but

285
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,810
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have case reports they have to</font>

286
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:12,250
be coded up and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our schema is a JSON</font>

287
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,319
schema which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like a literal</font>

288
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,750
thing you know it's there's a standard

289
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,790
for JSON schemas and what it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

290
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,959
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is get a hierarchical structure</font>

291
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,759
for our data and the problem is this

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduces a couple things that later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

293
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,000
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have to count for the</font>

294
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,859
first is the hierarchical nature so if

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,810
in normal we have like an action right

296
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">now actually could be hacking but we</font>

297
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,489
have varieties of hacking so action

298
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,730
hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety sequel injection action</font>

299
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,230
hacking variety cross-site scripting

300
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,199
action hacking variety use of stolen

301
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,149
credentials and so we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

302
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,639
capture we're capturing at multiple

303
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,110
levels of the hierarchy and that's going

304
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cause us parsing problems later on</font>

305
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,959
that we know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve because I</font>

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,589
wouldn't tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it if I</font>

307
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:02,369
consultant knocking the other problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

308
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:04,389
have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it creates multinomial data</font>

309
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-exclusive multinomial data in fact</font>

310
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,470
so that normally what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is you'd</font>

311
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a feature and that feature would</font>

312
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,029
have a set of values<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can take on</font>

313
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,370
well our features can be multiple values

314
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,470
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time action hacking variety</font>

315
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,860
can be cross-site scripting at the same

316
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:23,410
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> as its sequel injection at the same</font>

317
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,410
time its use of stolen credentials and

318
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,569
the hierarchy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON schema is fine it</font>

319
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,790
knows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as we</font>

320
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:33,628
get into parsing we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we have</font>

321
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,660
to accommodate that those challenges and

322
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:40,660
so of word about kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the schema the</font>

323
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,969
technical realities of it so the scheme

324
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,579
itself it was good but we realized there

325
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,250
was some fields we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> for debe ir</font>

326
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:50,649
and then there were other fields that we

327
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,759
wanted for our open<font color="#CCCCCC"> dataset</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vcd be and</font>

328
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,220
then there were some fields that really

329
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,199
you know we're just exclusive to those

330
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,129
two things so the community schema

331
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,569
didn't have that so now we're up to

332
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">three schemas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way each schema</font>

333
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,719
isn't really represented by a single

334
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,429
file it takes multiple files to

335
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,730
represent it because the parsing scripts

336
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:11,740
use different

337
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:14,470
different pieces of the schema and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

338
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we've got five files / three types</font>

339
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,430
and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you know it's not a static</font>

340
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,290
thing we change it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so now</font>

341
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,149
there's iterations of it so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

342
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,759
five files by three schemas by multiple

343
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,290
iterations and you know it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

344
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,089
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take that and you store</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

345
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,379
in a single repository under the same

346
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,029
name and just hope that people

347
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:33,910
understand which directories are which

348
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what the hell is what and</font>

349
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,019
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead we say let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go find a better</font>

350
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,499
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and so we've broken it</font>

351
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:43,990
out by the repositories<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the schemas</font>

352
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">liban so our DB I our version of the</font>

353
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,399
schema lives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our DB I our repository</font>

354
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:52,059
various community the sea lives in the

355
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,730
various repository and now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

356
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:56,499
very clearly defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of files and</font>

357
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,850
what they do and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're used for</font>

358
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:59,860
and that's defined in the repository

359
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,230
with them and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adding</font>

360
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,139
directories within the repository for

361
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,749
the different iterations we just iterate

362
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire repository so we have good</font>

363
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:11,589
traceability and these are things that

364
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,019
are obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're clear no one would</font>

365
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:18,040
ever make these mistakes right except us

366
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:21,309
you know last year now the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

367
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,709
thing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

368
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:26,079
there's there's the schema<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

369
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,209
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the conversion script and</font>

370
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,339
then there's the input file and the

371
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,859
theory is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the input file will be</font>

372
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,660
perfectly parsed by the conversion

373
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,949
script which will perfectly generate the

374
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,719
schema the reality is that physics does

375
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:42,219
not require the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same fields being each</font>

376
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,660
one of those right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like</font>

377
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,759
magically because you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was that</font>

378
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,529
way that's what happens what happens is

379
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,819
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have this and it all agrees the</font>

380
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,290
first time someone writes it but then

381
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:51,670
someone over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the input file</font>

382
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,649
decides that they want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a couple</font>

383
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,759
more enumerations and so they put them

384
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,549
in there but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't tell the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy who</font>

385
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,110
wrote the import script and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

386
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,059
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even put it in the</font>

387
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,499
schema so the schema had something but

388
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,029
no one actually bothered to come back

389
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:05,529
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that wrote these two</font>

390
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to put it in there or they</font>

391
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,529
thought they were partisan it here but

392
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,579
someone commented that line<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code out</font>

393
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,379
because it was really weird and they

394
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:12,910
didn't understand it and all this sudden

395
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,949
over a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things become</font>

396
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,660
inconsistent so we spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time</font>

397
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:19,779
the summer going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and making them</font>

398
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,639
consistent and the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the the</font>

399
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:22,060
issues are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any of the major or</font>

400
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,190
we're not

401
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,209
the major places they remind things that

402
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,890
really had low coverage enumeration wise

403
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,780
but this is one of those challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

404
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,280
run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you have to have a plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

405
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to keep all of those</font>

406
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,579
consistent and so the next step once

407
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,380
you've gone through that you've you know

408
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,820
parse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day on the schema</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net now you</font>

409
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,040
want to validate right because you want

410
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trust but you want to verify and we</font>

411
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,870
get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different thing anomalies we get</font>

412
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,660
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of missing values or typos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

413
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,920
most common sometimes there's always one

414
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,329
file that just that you look at and

415
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like how could any of our tools</font>

416
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,320
have outputted that raw data like that

417
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not physically possible so you end up</font>

418
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,580
like spending hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fixing that</font>

419
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,580
one up and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna said we have</font>

420
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,170
heuristic rules that were applying we

421
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,240
want to double-check those heuristic

422
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,709
rules and so the validation script

423
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
checks the heuristics it also checks the

424
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:15,130
business logic we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> NYX codes for</font>

425
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,360
industries we want to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even</font>

426
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,820
though that's a six digit or a five

427
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,600
digit number it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the valid codes</font>

428
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,340
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all numbers are valid and so</font>

429
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mott the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> validation script does that</font>

430
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,370
and this is another plow place where we

431
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,110
ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting technical</font>

432
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,030
challenge because it turns out

433
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,820
validating you know 100,000 records

434
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,560
isn't always fast and our Python script

435
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">ran really really slow at it and so</font>

436
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,770
we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

437
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,479
what will turn it into no<font color="#CCCCCC"> jasm will</font>

438
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,490
validate and nodejs and that works it

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,080
was fast but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a huge amount of</font>

440
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,900
technical overhead because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it added an</font>

441
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,240
entirely new tool chain to a process and

442
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,560
when you add that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it makes scripting</font>

443
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,110
a lot worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now you're calling</font>

444
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,329
no.js from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python and on top of that you</font>

445
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,150
tell your team members hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do</font>

446
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want install node.js and they go no</font>

447
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,000
you know and so they're like you run it

448
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so now you're the only person who</font>

449
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,010
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run it we fixed that we went</font>

450
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,629
back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Python code</font>

451
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,060
figured out now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Python is actually</font>

452
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,970
faster than nodejs was but better we

453
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,310
convinced condensed it down to a more

454
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,750
maintainable product and in fact because

455
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,149
it's all Python we can import the

456
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,339
validation script and we can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

457
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,930
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the import script so it's a</font>

458
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:31,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">single step process and so of course if</font>

459
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,700
we're validating that kind of implies

460
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if we find anything we have to</font>

461
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,000
revalidate re-import

462
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,429
fact we also get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data you</font>

463
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know partners give us data over time you</font>

464
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,850
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they give us this set and they go</font>

465
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,530
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got some more and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key Nettie</font>

466
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,179
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns out that if you have 40</font>

467
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,010
partners providing an incident data we

468
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,320
had 70 partners for years so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

469
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,840
provide incident data and you have to do

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,980
these iterations multiple times it's a

471
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,020
really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to look for</font>

472
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,040
speed because I'm the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do</font>

473
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:05,800
this and you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out we had it</font>

474
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,450
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four steps last year and but</font>

475
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,399
every hour I had to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

476
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,929
computer type in some line of code it

477
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,790
hit the button and leave for an hour and

478
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,740
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out when you do that four times</font>

479
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">in an hour each step it takes four hours</font>

480
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,910
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through each freakin iteration</font>

481
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's my time no and you can't like have</font>

482
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,420
a beer while you're doing that and so

483
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,530
the team like finishes up the coding it

484
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,429
like five o'clock they're like great

485
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gabe we're ready for you to start</font>

486
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:29,140
emporia and like nine o'clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

487
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,550
finally have my<font color="#CCCCCC"> frickin beer and I don't</font>

488
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,230
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my beer earlier than that</font>

489
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,240
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year we're bringing into a</font>

490
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,640
more push button style we're keeping

491
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,380
state in the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we can just</font>

492
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">hit it button it will realize okay these</font>

493
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,990
are the files that change those are the

494
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,260
ones that need to be re-imported

495
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,790
revalidated it will rerun that assuming

496
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,679
it gets no validation errors it will

497
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,409
tell us if it gets them will let us<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

498
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,170
and that way we've done in it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

499
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,360
speed it gets his consistency gets us

500
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,690
repeatability in fact it lets us we be

501
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,699
parallelized not paralyze us now so that

502
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,410
each individual partner coming in gets

503
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,600
its own process and we're running five

504
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:09,280
or ten processes at the same time which

505
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so now</font>

506
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got a hundred thousand JSON</font>

507
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:16,540
records right and the way we analyze

508
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,730
these as we print everyone out and then

509
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,080
we put them in front of a camera and

510
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we just flip them really quick and</font>

511
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,629
we look for what we do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put them in</font>

512
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,040
our that the whole picture thing isn't

513
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:33,940
happening so who here is used are ya

514
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:37,030
couples<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so our likes tables right</font>

515
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,179
it likes tabular data does<font color="#CCCCCC"> our like JSON</font>

516
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,320
know our doesn't like JSON it will work

517
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,230
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it's not what it's designed</font>

518
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,220
for and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we need to cram a tree a</font>

519
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,809
hierarchical structure into a data frame

520
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,980
and this is where we start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run in</font>

521
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">those problems with the hierarchical</font>

522
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,919
nature and the multinomial non-exclusive

523
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,139
multinomial structure the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

524
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,630
the way we handle this is we make every

525
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,510
leaf in the JSON schema its own column

526
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,210
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a column for action hacking</font>

527
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,789
variety cross-site scripting and it's a

528
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,130
boolean column it's true or false and so

529
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,990
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> record that has its true not is</font>

530
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,309
false and we have another column for

531
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,830
action hacking variety sequel injection

532
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:20,908
another one for lost and stolen assets

533
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:23,010
and so now we've solved our the problem

534
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:25,080
of storing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-exclusive multinomial</font>

535
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,908
data but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't solve the</font>

536
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,129
hierarchical problem and so we're going

537
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:30,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to add in some surrogate columns</font>

538
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,690
to deal with that so we're going to have

539
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:36,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to add in a column for action hacking</font>

540
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,340
and the way we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill that in</font>

541
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,080
is anything that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of action</font>

542
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,360
hacking is going to have action hacking

543
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,129
is true as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so now we've</font>

544
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,340
accounted for our hierarchical data but

545
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,650
again and that one now is pretty easy to

546
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:54,350
parse it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parsing</font>

547
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,350
problems that the non-exclusive data has

548
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,928
say now a final thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is</font>

549
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,880
all your current data set you like you

550
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,960
did all this process you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,850
brought in your hundred thousand records

552
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,200
but we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font>

553
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,418
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> today we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know what</font>

554
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,940
happen last year and what happened the

555
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,280
year before and so it's important to

556
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data in the same format from</font>

557
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,639
prior years and keep it someplace

558
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:18,900
accessible so that when you import

559
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,280
you're not just importing your current

560
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,549
data set your also importing those

561
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,039
historic ones and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

562
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:29,100
impress oh if i use scheme aversion to

563
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,539
today and last year i use schema version

564
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">1 i need some way to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those other</font>

565
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,150
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000 records and bring them</font>

566
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,379
up to date when this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

567
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,940
straightforward stuff it's all easy but

568
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,470
it's all things to think about if you

569
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,440
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them you run into them</font>

570
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,059
when you try to do the process and so

571
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,890
once we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all into the data</font>

572
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,870
frame and nice into a place to analyze

573
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,320
it it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start exploring it i'll</font>

574
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,799
head over to anna to do that so we've

575
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,100
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exploration process</font>

576
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:59,590
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the audio I think</font>

577
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm louder than you are possibly hello

578
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,939
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we made the</font>

579
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,100
exploration process more efficient by

580
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pre generating a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

581
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,219
more common exploratory analysis we<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto</font>

582
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate three reports where we slice</font>

583
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,179
and dice the data in different ways by

584
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:18,850
the way we use knitter which is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> R</font>

585
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,830
markdown language for reporting so what

586
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,779
how we slice and dice the data is that

587
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,699
we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall summary we look</font>

588
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,200
at trends over time and then also any

589
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,840
significant changes since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

590
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,549
year the reason why we look at the very

591
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,709
it look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from different</font>

592
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,989
perspectives is that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

593
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,639
know if the features value or its trend

594
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:39,159
over time is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more</font>

595
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:41,559
interesting and then also with these

596
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,210
reports we actually run them twice so we

597
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:46,389
run it for incidents and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaches</font>

598
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,950
as well we also run these reports for

599
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:51,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">the overall data set and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then also</font>

600
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">subsets so this includes patterns</font>

601
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:57,249
industries or partners so<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall we are</font>

602
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">working around there's a probably total</font>

603
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:01,840
around 8,500 figures generated in total

604
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:05,139
and this is another place by the way

605
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,549
where we paralyze so these reports take

606
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:08,649
a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to run because there's so</font>

607
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:10,779
much data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and so we end up</font>

608
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:13,199
running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or ten reports at</font>

609
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,850
the same time as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in our core flow</font>

610
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,100
for exploring the data we also don't

611
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,340
wait until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data is complete to start</font>

612
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the actual exploratory analysis we</font>

613
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,519
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> already gained insight before the</font>

614
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,379
data is complete and then we also start

615
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,269
the exploratory analysis early because

616
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:33,309
it helps us to find any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

617
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,679
anomalies that we may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to</font>

618
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:37,239
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw data or the source so we run</font>

619
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,999
these reports early and we run them

620
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:42,999
often also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a note it's an easy</font>

621
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:46,149
mistake to only look at your current

622
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:48,249
version of of your data Gabe and I make

623
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,018
it a habit to actually explore the data

624
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:51,820
frame manually because sometimes we may

625
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,889
be able to gain insight that the pre

626
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,649
generated pre-generated reports don't

627
00:23:53,889 --> 00:24:00,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture and the key thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to always</font>

628
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your raw data so our main</font>

629
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,750
objective is to make novel findings to

630
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,810
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> developing our hypotheses</font>

631
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,130
these hypotheses help us to decide all

632
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,139
right what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually need to talk</font>

633
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">about in the report we look for things</font>

634
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,620
that are big that have changed

635
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,870
significantly between years things that

636
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">are commonly seen together and things</font>

637
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:21,580
that we've you know we've seen patterns

638
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,790
remember they're almost predictable we

639
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:28,510
also want to take care to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's</font>

640
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:30,159
unexpected and what may cause that so

641
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,720
it's also not enough to actually find

642
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,660
something that's novel we have to answer

643
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,340
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay why why is it relevant</font>

644
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,280
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we put the finding into</font>

645
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,189
some sort of context so first we have to

646
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,899
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the finding actually true or do</font>

647
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to fix something in the source</font>

648
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,570
data or the import process we use tools

649
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,580
such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules to help to</font>

650
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,060
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question of why a finding is</font>

651
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,949
relevant so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> association rules show</font>

652
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,740
us how enumerations relate to other

653
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,680
features and what had occurred most

654
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,930
pertaining to the novel finding so we

655
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,670
use some key attributes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

656
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,370
rules such as support confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

657
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,530
lift and then we also look at the

658
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,659
distribution of a feature with and

659
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,240
without an enumeration for example if we

660
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at action we will look at</font>

661
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution with actor internal</font>

662
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:24,070
excluded as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actor dot</font>

663
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,870
internal so we not we end up looking at

664
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,820
the entire distribution and seeing how

665
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,679
it shifts and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at just one</font>

666
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,689
enumeration<font color="#E5E5E5"> but actually is set we not</font>

667
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,420
only do we look at incident data we also

668
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,130
look at non incident data it helps to

669
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,100
answer the question of why key finding

670
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,720
is relevant and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also helps to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put our</font>

671
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,179
incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> and breach data into some sort</font>

672
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,370
of context so non incident data is not

673
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,560
as refined as incident data we may not

674
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,300
necessarily you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get what we need or</font>

675
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">want from the partner there's no</font>

676
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,340
standard schema it takes a lot of time

677
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do exploratory analysis because</font>

678
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,570
that's all manual for an incident data

679
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,160
and then we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate</font>

680
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,960
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a partner to make any kind of</font>

681
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,380
clarifications or maybe they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

682
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide some additional data to us</font>

683
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,800
they all the other nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about not</font>

684
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,290
incident data is that we can correlate

685
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,629
findings across multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> data sets so</font>

686
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,670
say partner sends us<font color="#E5E5E5"> men</font>

687
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're data where and we maybe find</font>

688
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,620
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting or our key</font>

689
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,510
finding what we actually do is we

690
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,919
collect multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets and then</font>

691
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,629
we're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually increase our</font>

692
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,000
sample size which decreases a random

693
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,440
error and we're able to verify those key

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,580
findings and then not incident data

695
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,920
grows quickly and it's quite big<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

696
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,629
we use is 32 or 64 gigs of ram and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

697
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,250
SSD which is very sufficient so we

698
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,480
didn't spin up any spark cluster or

699
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:51,420
anything and we also spun up an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AZ to</font>

700
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,280
share our data files this really helps

701
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure consistency so if Gabe</font>

702
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,810
generates a stat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I validate it we're</font>

703
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,409
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working off the reclaimed</font>

704
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,300
version which saves a lot of time so

705
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,430
then from exploring we actually have to

706
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,399
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking you know go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into</font>

707
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,350
the writing phase so first we have to

708
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,780
decide what actually constitutes the

709
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,000
data set not all records are made the

710
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">same some records have a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unknowns</font>

711
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the required fields so what we do is</font>

712
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,190
we score all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> records for complexity</font>

713
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,600
and then we discard all those records

714
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,940
that are below a certain threshold so

715
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,389
today we we have our threshold is set to

716
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">7 enumerations and this helps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

717
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,370
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what actually encompasses the</font>

718
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,730
data set because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

719
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,229
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent all legitimate data</font>

720
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,720
the data set will end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a</font>

721
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,290
combination of south of subsets of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

722
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,780
full data corpus so for example in 2016

723
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,310
we had over 300,000 records but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

724
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,639
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually ended up being a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

725
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:57,090
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 230,000 records so after removing</font>

726
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,370
those low complexity records the next

727
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,919
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to identify and review</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

728
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,600
major subsets of the data so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

729
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,480
normally in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> several hundred breaches</font>

730
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">to several thousand incidents for</font>

731
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,390
example in 2016 our major subsets of the

732
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,400
data was dried<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and web app attacks so</font>

733
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,800
we have to understand what causes<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

734
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,950
major subsets<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the data and we need</font>

735
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider several things so first so</font>

736
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,210
the limited number of sources report a

737
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,710
lot of common<font color="#CCCCCC"> low fidelity incidents</font>

738
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,750
which was reflected in web app attacks

739
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,880
did a limited number of sources have a

740
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,679
unique view that added a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

741
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-quality incidents and this was</font>

742
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,360
reflected in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dry decks and then finally</font>

743
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,580
did something unique happen this year

744
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,408
that made something stand out across

745
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,000
sources and this is where actually

746
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,919
started getting into arm into our

747
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,490
patterns where we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

748
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,230
attacks happening over and over so then

749
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,330
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how</font>

750
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,520
do how do these major subsets affect the

751
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,260
overall data set do does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look like</font>

752
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,549
they don't affect it at all do they skew

753
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:02,020
it in a way do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> eclipse it entirely</font>

754
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:05,049
so I have to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how to handle</font>

755
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">these first we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the subset as</font>

756
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:09,490
part of the overall data set<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we</font>

757
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">just caveat skew which is what we did</font>

758
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:15,190
with dried<font color="#CCCCCC"> X in our report we could also</font>

759
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:17,260
analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data set separately which is</font>

760
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,760
what we did for web app attacks and then

761
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:23,320
we could also do both which is where we

762
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:25,750
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our patterns so</font>

763
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,029
overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> before writing we need to work</font>

764
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,789
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single subset of the data this is</font>

765
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:32,380
our subset embarrass and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by at this</font>

766
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:35,049
point we've decided what to include and

767
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,880
exclude from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data set we're also</font>

768
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,240
looking at approaches of accommodating

769
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,279
for skewness specifically you can reduce

770
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,350
skewness by applying transformation so

771
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,059
your plates a variable with a function

772
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that variable so if you want to</font>

773
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduce right or positive skewness where</font>

774
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,870
extreme data results are larger you'll

775
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,549
have frequent small losses and few

776
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,289
extreme gains and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

777
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start taking your roots logs and</font>

778
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:01,419
reciprocals if you want to reduce left

779
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:05,200
or negative skewness where extreme data

780
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:07,120
results are smaller frequent small gains

781
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,279
and few extreme losses that's where you

782
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,209
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your squares cubes</font>

783
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,799
and higher powers so then the fun begins

784
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,710
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start actually generating our</font>

785
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,000
stats and developing our hypotheses

786
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,620
first we differentiate between an

787
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,799
incident in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach and our analysis</font>

788
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,750
and then when we report the stats in the

789
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to report on the stats and the</font>

790
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,740
report so i had to find what how we

791
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,169
define an incident and we define a

792
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,600
breach as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security incident that has</font>

793
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,960
confirmed data disclosure of an asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

794
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,418
an unauthorized party

795
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,059
we also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be aware of what</font>

796
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,159
constitutes a filter for example if you

797
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,590
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field year it can be</font>

798
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,600
interpreted three different ways first

799
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,629
incident year that's the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

800
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,090
incident occurred second we have debe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir</font>

801
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,669
year this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a debe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ir year the data was</font>

802
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:59,220
assigned to so our collection period is

803
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:01,049
from november to<font color="#E5E5E5"> november and then</font>

804
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,399
finally we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data set</font>

805
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,100
year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year that the data</font>

806
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,219
was actually imported so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> coating up</font>

807
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,889
incidents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> vc DB say we code up we</font>

808
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,809
caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in 2016 the actual incidents</font>

809
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,539
occurred several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it would be</font>

810
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,820
inappropriate to include them into this

811
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,879
year as current incidents in the report

812
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,610
because they had occurred<font color="#E5E5E5"> prot in prior</font>

813
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,559
years so the key here is that those said

814
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,840
incidents are assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DB I are</font>

815
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">here associated to the actual incident</font>

816
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,668
year we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to be careful when</font>

817
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,678
people request for stats regarding year

818
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:36,600
so if they ask for a stat across

819
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,630
multiple years we<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually assume</font>

820
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,399
calendar year if they ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this year</font>

821
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,980
we usually assume data since last report

822
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,360
again we always communicate and clarify

823
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,539
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the same thing</font>

824
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,250
and also again we exclude those old

825
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,899
incidents that we just happen to code up

826
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,990
this year but that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had occurred</font>

827
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:57,449
in previous years then we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

828
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,000
be careful of catch-all for example

829
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,760
unknown other nna what's measured what's

830
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,070
not measured do we count it or do we not

831
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,260
for unknown we consider is not measured

832
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:10,559
it doesn't add any additional knowledge

833
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,830
when we encode the unknowns because it

834
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,139
adds no data we typically exclude it for

835
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,970
others we consider it measured but it's

836
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,360
just not covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our schema so it</font>

837
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:23,130
does add data so we do include it

838
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,799
finally with na<font color="#E5E5E5"> s it actually depends on</font>

839
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,419
the question so for asking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

840
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,000
of breaches involved a financial motive

841
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,610
we would typically include this because

842
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,260
some breeches just have no motive but if

843
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,649
we're asking what percent of motives are

844
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,200
financial we exclude it because na is

845
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:41,668
not a motive so those questions sound

846
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,210
like they're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar things but</font>

847
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:48,059
they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite different then</font>

848
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,000
comes counting and how do we count n the

849
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,340
normal way to calculate it is

850
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,990
we count<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each enumeration we</font>

851
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,300
sum up the counts and we get our end

852
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work for those records and</font>

853
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,870
incidents that have multiple

854
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,850
enumerations so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

855
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,919
one incident that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is both social and</font>

856
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,800
malware it will be counted more than

857
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,960
once so<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead what we do is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

858
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,940
subset the records<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we care about</font>

859
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,680
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to analyze we exclude</font>

860
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:18,080
our unknowns<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any potentially anaise</font>

861
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:20,210
and then you know then we sum up if we

862
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,340
count the number of records I eat the

863
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,760
number of rows before summing up those

864
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,679
features next we look at confidence this

865
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very important when we're subsetting</font>

866
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,660
data because our sample sizes decreased

867
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,630
quite quickly this is where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

868
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:38,120
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your random error we</font>

869
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:41,270
look at confidence intervals I want to

870
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if they overlap for example for</font>

871
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,090
where you know we're working with

872
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,310
statements like hacking was greater than

873
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,699
malware this year or hacking increase

874
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:52,010
from last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year so just to recall if</font>

875
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,360
there's no overlap and the confidence

876
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,100
intervals this implies that the

877
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,709
difference is statistically significant

878
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,570
if there is overlap it doesn't

879
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily mean that sick that the</font>

880
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,330
difference is not statistically

881
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:07,910
significant so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on who you talk</font>

882
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,489
to people define confidence intervals

883
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,870
slightly differently it is correct to

884
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,580
say that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a ninety-five percent</font>

885
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,888
chance that the confidence interval you

886
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,299
calculated includes the true population

887
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:21,830
mean some other people define it as

888
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,840
there's a ninety-five percent chance

889
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,770
that the population mean lies within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

890
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,620
interval which is not quite correct also

891
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:34,250
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more confident that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

892
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,629
interval contains a true parameter so

893
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,980
for instance we instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ninety-five</font>

894
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:40,310
percent we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at ninety-nine</font>

895
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,960
percent the interval we become wider if

896
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,270
there's more variance in our data it

897
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,210
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates wider intervals and as well</font>

898
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:50,980
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller sample sizes that creates</font>

899
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,980
wider intervals and

900
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,480
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a inverse square</font>

901
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,800
relationship between confidence

902
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,570
intervals and sample sizes so if you

903
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,640
want to decrease your margin of error by

904
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:03,670
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll technically have to</font>

905
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,650
quadruple your sample size<font color="#E5E5E5"> so overall we</font>

906
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,060
calculate these confidence intervals we

907
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,410
don't include them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the report because</font>

908
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,549
a majority of our readership could care

909
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:15,490
less about actual upper and lower limits

910
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:17,110
we can treat our data in two main ways

911
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,290
so we can we look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

912
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,150
binomial perspective which is what we

913
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done in previous years and to date</font>

914
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,370
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what question you're</font>

915
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,410
asking for binomial<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus multinomial</font>

916
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,410
for binomial we work with primarily

917
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:35,470
boolean columns so you know is it for an

918
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,029
incident was it you know social a social

919
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,950
incident true or false malware true or

920
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,920
false was their data disclosure true or

921
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:44,109
false so again this was our primary one

922
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,040
but the problem here is that it doesn't

923
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:49,060
model interdependencies between features

924
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,500
so that's where it's nice to start

925
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a multinomial</font>

926
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,400
perspective especially for those records

927
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,509
that have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one enumeration</font>

928
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,920
because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only looking at a</font>

929
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:02,740
singular<font color="#E5E5E5"> enumeration you're actually</font>

930
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:06,070
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tena</font>

931
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">stats in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dbi are lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of presents we</font>

932
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,600
can't ever say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was X number</font>

933
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:12,370
of breaches in you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past year</font>

934
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,790
we never know the population size we

935
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,620
always work with sample sizes so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

936
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">our percentages we break it down by</font>

937
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,450
action or by pattern or whatever it may

938
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,220
be the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when it 11</font>

939
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,439
enumeration increases it may look like

940
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,259
another enumeration is decreasing for

941
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,380
example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacking breaches</font>

942
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,840
in 2015 and in 2016 then you look at

943
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,220
malware you have 10 and 2015 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

944
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,140
have a thousand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty sixteen</font>

945
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,029
malware is going to look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

946
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,830
increasing but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

947
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,630
hacking look like it's decreasing when

948
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:45,610
in fact it was actually consistent per

949
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,900
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with things like that when we</font>

950
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,510
generate figures and it looks a little

951
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,460
bit misleading we are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful to</font>

952
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:56,470
annotate that for a readership to avoid

953
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">any kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> confusion so then after we</font>

954
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,770
generate all these stats then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

955
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,090
actually validate those hypotheses which

956
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gabe will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

957
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:06,160
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to talk about validating the</font>

958
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,070
data now I get to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about validating</font>

959
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,649
those hypotheses right well we'll start

960
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,960
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the figures so this is one of the</font>

961
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,940
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in reality when people say</font>

962
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,460
they read the DBR what they really said

963
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,320
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I looked at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the figures you know</font>

964
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,700
that's like that's the standard but in

965
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,140
fact it's cool if like when we're

966
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,850
briefing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB our way I cast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

967
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,379
question and you're like who read the

968
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">DBR and there's like a few people it's</font>

969
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if you ask who read it first like a</font>

970
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,710
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people raise their hand if you</font>

971
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,120
ask who looked at the figures for it so

972
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,530
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of hands there and then no</font>

973
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,850
one raises their hand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reading</font>

974
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,380
question because they weren't really

975
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,299
sure where you were going with<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when</font>

976
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,220
you asked reading first and like I I

977
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,810
don't like not<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise my hand here and</font>

978
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it sound like I didn't even look at</font>

979
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but people look at the figures right</font>

980
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,870
that's that's how we communicate and so

981
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,529
we want the figures to communicate our

982
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,390
points clearly right and so we use the

983
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,480
common ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use bar graphs and we use</font>

984
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,900
line charts you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> very standard ways</font>

985
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,550
to go but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate clearly</font>

986
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,890
without necessarily being simple you can

987
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,210
have complex figures that communicate

988
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,190
clearly and we try to put a little bit

989
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of variety in we had a parallel</font>

990
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,820
coordinates tower we actually had an art

991
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:16,630
plot in there for everyone that red bike

992
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,210
into the appendix but the important

993
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:21,670
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you track these figures for</font>

994
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,310
validation so we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we run the</font>

995
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,540
exploratory reports right every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

996
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,370
those exploratory reports with every one

997
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,800
of those figures has a unique ID on it

998
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,359
and when they someone from our team goes

999
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're going to put this figure into</font>

1000
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,080
the report or into the section i'm

1001
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,400
writing we capture that unique ID and

1002
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,500
all the code associated with that figure

1003
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,870
and it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a validation of figure</font>

1004
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,390
report for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that figure report has</font>

1005
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the unique ID it has the title which is</font>

1006
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,930
effectively the hypothesis for that

1007
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,779
figure and then it has the entire code

1008
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,850
to generate it that way we can track and

1009
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,410
we can track it as things change and if

1010
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,330
someone comes and request one of us to

1011
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,569
do a figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them we given the unique</font>

1012
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,430
ID that way is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report is being</font>

1013
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,930
written and put together we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1014
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,210
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the figures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1015
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,310
we have a report that can generate them

1016
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,930
all and that way we have confidence that

1017
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,799
we can repeat those figures and can do

1018
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,799
them consistently

1019
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,049
and we do this all with knitter the same

1020
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,058
thing we do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Explorer turn reports</font>

1021
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:20,640
with and we do it with ggplot<font color="#CCCCCC"> has anyone</font>

1022
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:22,170
here use ggplot has anyone written like

1023
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,740
a ggplot figure that was really nice and

1024
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:28,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">like under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten lines it's big but you</font>

1025
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,229
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice layout quality figures</font>

1026
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:34,770
from it it's the way to go and by the

1027
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">way so we wrote the report and then and</font>

1028
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,700
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this last year we went on a</font>

1029
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,839
podcast with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a professor who specializes</font>

1030
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,399
in data figures and had him critique it

1031
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,490
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continuously get</font>

1032
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,930
better and you know what he didn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1033
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,368
whole lot but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already said it</font>

1034
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't count if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually listen to</font>

1035
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the podcast he do you remember like the</font>

1036
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:56,880
flow graphs they're really bright and

1037
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,140
they had lines and stuff and he's like

1038
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah you can't use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those ever again</font>

1039
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,400
people can't read this and we really we

1040
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,690
kind of knew it but we include them for

1041
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,069
consistency but next year we're probably

1042
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,680
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace him with small</font>

1043
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,210
multiples charts also a great idea is he

1044
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,500
took the figures and he said look you've

1045
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">got this figure that's got this one</font>

1046
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,819
really big bar in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bars why</font>

1047
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,490
don't you put like a big big red letter

1048
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:20,880
a on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then in your in your</font>

1049
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,040
text you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same big red</font>

1050
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,380
letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> a that way people that want to</font>

1051
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,599
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bar is or why it's big</font>

1052
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,730
can find the spot easily in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your text</font>

1053
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,319
it's a great recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's one</font>

1054
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:34,950
will hopefully see in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DVR next year</font>

1055
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:38,099
and what we do for figures we want to do

1056
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:40,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">for all of our hypotheses right so you</font>

1057
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:44,369
see statements like hacking was greater

1058
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,609
than malware or malware increased since

1059
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:50,369
last year or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing was forty</font>

1060
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,828
percent of breaches every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of</font>

those statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the report this year</font>

1062
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:57,569
was in a validation report and we

1063
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,490
probably made a mistake in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

1064
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:01,380
year last year we waited till the report

1065
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,390
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> written and we wrote those next year</font>

we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give out a unique ID with</font>

1068
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,510
it and we're in our validation report

1069
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:10,980
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put that unique ID we're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to put the hypothesis so we've got</font>

00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,709
hypothesis we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put the code</font>

tracked back to the law

1077
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">chick which a riot at and it's so it's</font>

1078
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar to the figure report and</font>

1079
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,549
the important thing or the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1080
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is because anomalies</font>

1081
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:38,339
creep in but you know there's something

1082
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:42,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do about keeping those anomalies</font>

1083
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:45,029
out the first is start from a single

1084
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,799
code base like it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad juju</font>

1085
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:48,210
if I like I'm running one version of our

1086
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:49,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna's running another version</font>

1087
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,329
because we may come up with the same

1088
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers we may not it depends what's</font>

1089
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:55,410
changed between the versions in fact

1090
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,970
it's really bad if I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1091
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:59,399
change what version of our I'm running

1092
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,868
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process so like we have a cut</font>

1093
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,130
off somewhere in like the fall where

1094
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,529
it's like we stopped updating our

1095
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,200
statistical software until like after

1096
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:09,359
the last version the last iteration of

1097
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,019
that dbr is published because we don't

1098
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,328
want to break our workflow or change our

1099
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,640
workflow midstream the next is you want

1100
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:19,499
a single data starting point so like

1101
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,118
Anna said we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of records</font>

1102
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:22,589
and we have to ultimately choose what

1103
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,079
are we going to analyze as the main set

1104
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:27,690
and what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be analyzed as</font>

1105
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,160
unique subsets separately because we

1106
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,900
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to represent all valid data but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1107
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,839
don't want our data to once i have data

1108
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clips others and so it's important to</font>

1109
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,828
bury clearly label what that starting

1110
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,749
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all of the analysts at work</font>

1111
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:41,880
with the data know where to start with

1112
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:43,859
their data we all start at the exact

1113
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,109
same point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helps us with</font>

1114
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,180
repeatability and additionally we also

1115
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,759
have a common analysis process we all

1116
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,038
used apply it who uses deep liar for our

1117
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:55,049
people oh come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's</font>

1118
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">suede so we had a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he used</font>

1119
00:42:55,049 --> 00:43:00,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">our and very few hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went up for deep</font>

1120
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,769
liar like if there we go at least one

1121
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,839
person because if you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> our and</font>

1122
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:06,419
not using deep liar you're going to be

1123
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,160
amazed at how like actually logical<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1124
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,499
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as opposed to like</font>

1125
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,359
feeding stuff backwards in time you

1126
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:14,368
normally do it you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get to</font>

1127
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:16,589
feed things forward and so we use the

1128
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:19,019
standard process for doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1129
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:21,119
because of that it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for us to</font>

1130
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:24,629
all arrive at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer every time</font>

1131
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,940
and so on the other hand there's places

1132
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,200
where we've tried to do things like the

1133
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Association rooms we talked about those</font>

1134
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,078
so with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association rules we've had</font>

1135
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,279
issues where like we generated stats and

1136
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">we generate interesting stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1137
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">association rules but they're very hard</font>

1138
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,400
to replicate you have to

1139
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,050
start with the exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same data the exact</font>

1140
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,790
same columns we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it on all of</font>

1141
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:46,860
our columns so we have to subset same

1142
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,570
and then it's like any machine learning

1143
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,910
algorithm the arguments you give to it

1144
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,930
strongly affect what the actual outcome

1145
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,640
is and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you got all that</font>

1146
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,660
exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time you</font>

1147
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,180
ran it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get the same</font>

1148
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,319
answer so instead you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something</font>

1149
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association rules we're going to go</font>

1150
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and recreate those stats using our</font>

1151
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,350
normal deep liar process that way we

1152
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:09,180
have confidence in the repeatability of

1153
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:12,420
them and so and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way like we</font>

1154
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,830
talked about in this track yesterday it

1155
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,930
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what your stats are if</font>

1156
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,310
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a so wat to them and so</font>

1157
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,870
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these great stats</font>

1158
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,060
you're going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this analysis for</font>

1159
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:22,920
confidence intervals and when it comes

1160
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,509
time to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh tons of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to</font>

1161
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,790
get cut out just like line after line

1162
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,470
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would not believe how much like</font>

1163
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:30,420
it's our favorite it's always the best

1164
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,870
analysis isn't it like the stuff that we

1165
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,270
love gets cut out and so it's important

1166
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,339
to just be prepared for that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1167
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,900
there's no so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind your data it</font>

1168
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't matter how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good the stats where</font>

1169
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the analysis was it doesn't go in and so</font>

1170
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,950
looking forward we're doing a lot of

1171
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">work the first on veras we're currently</font>

1172
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:54,089
iterating versions to increase the

1173
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,609
enumerations to get a more coverage on

1174
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,950
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want we're also going to fix</font>

1175
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,930
some consistency issues in the hierarchy

1176
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,640
on the next version and then we're going

1177
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,649
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sequencing so that you can in</font>

1178

various you can record this action

00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,160
happened then this one then this one or

1180
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,110
this action happened and it compromised

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> which led to this you know which</font>

1182
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,620
will let us capture some additional

1183
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,140
granularity as well as being able to

1184
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,850
represent things like pin tests we're

1185
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,920
also doing a lot of work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> varus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> r</font>

1186
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,529

1190
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,570
kind of stuff it currently uses data

1191
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,220
tables which sound really great until

1192
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:34,050
they break everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do like once a</font>

1193
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,790
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we're going to get back off</font>

1194
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:39,300
those it turned out sounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> good when we</font>

1195
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,700
did it we're also putting an additional

1196
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,070
helper code and functions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

1197
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,509
analysis tools within it it's stuff that

1198
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,040
currently resides in a separate

1199
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,720
repository but we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's</font>

1200
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,029
available to everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're putting</font>

1201
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">in more statistical tools and adding in</font>

1202
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,460
things so that other people can

1203
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">on confidence intervals when they're</font>

1204
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,400
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our varus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ours by the way</font>

1205
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:59,820
all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is open you can download</font>

1206
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,010
off github we're also working on our

1207
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,930
workflow and by the way when we're

1208
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,820
updating this stuff we're updating a

1209
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,100
consistent manner especially like

1210
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,440
updating the varus schema you know we

1211
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,759
have a huge chart for everything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1212
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,370
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single thing in the entire</font>

1213
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,810
workflow gets updated at the same time

1214
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have half the workflow on</font>

1215
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,049
one thing in half on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other and</font>

1216
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,130
that's hard to do but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1217
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,180
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plan for if you're going to</font>

1218
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:26,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain a tool like this add a tool and</font>

1219
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,540
so we're updating our workflow making it

1220
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:33,120
easier more repeatable faster and

1221
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:36,050
generally trying to make the whole

1222
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:39,359
system easy to run consistent and

1223
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:40,560
repeatable and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you took the</font>

1224
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,440
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one thing I want to</font>

1225
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,960
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about here we all generate data</font>

1226
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,570
products and we've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to terms with</font>

1227
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data but not everyone in the world</font>

1228
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,770
in fact not everyone in information

1229
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,030
security has because you know it's hard

1230
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,380
when your brain is telling you something

1231
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,970
like someone's telling you something

1232
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,090
with data and your brain is telling you

1233
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:02,129
something different right and because

1234
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:04,590
you look at the data and it feels a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1235
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,120
like magic right that analysis process

1236
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,890
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entire methodology is</font>

1237
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,630
disclosed it still feels a little like

1238
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,839
magic because your brain is saying I

1239
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:16,620
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if I believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data but</font>

1240
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,810
there's a sign in the UK it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like art</font>

1241
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,690
on the side of ability ins says your

1242
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:24,420
mind is crazy and tells you lies right

1243
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,520
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a lot of truth to</font>

1244
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,810
that because if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contrast</font>

1245
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,450
what happens with your brain right

1246
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,740
because your brain can organize all this

1247
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,390
like it'd be great if you had a process

1248
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,450
but you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put this all into a</font>

1249
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:38,879
single picture but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd take a lot of</font>

1250
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:40,319
skill<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of thought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn that</font>

1251
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">into something interesting all those</font>

1252
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,280
disparate parts and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1253
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain has to do and the downside is</font>

1254
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,560
there's there's no documentation of what

1255
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,150
your mind did right how those ideas are

1256
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,160
forming you don't know what data went

1257
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:55,820
into it you know maybe your mind

1258
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,859
excluded all the little cardboard bricks

1259
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:00,090
maybe it brought in a bunch of a Lincoln

1260
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,290
Logs and added those because they were

1261
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,290
somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mind and so it decided</font>

1262
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,640
include them in your model you know you

1263
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,870
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have no way</font>

1264
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,940
of

1265
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:10,850
questioning or validating the process

1266
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that went into creating the picture and</font>

1267
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,610
you have no way of maintaining

1268
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,200
consistency so like today I might look

1269
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:17,750
at this and know that looks like a

1270
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,069
flamingo you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a few</font>

1271
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,660
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the road I get the same</font>

1272
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with the same data and like</font>

1273
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,220
great that's a Tonka truck you know you

1274
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:29,270

that come from their mind and those that

though the data is not perfect it never

it have a consistent process you know

1292
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,990
and if possible automate for

1293
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,450
repeatability more importantly document

1294
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:16,700
everything you do put a unique ID on

1295
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:20,359
everything you generate question

1296
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:23,990
everything that everything of interest

1297
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,880
and communicate because when you

1298
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,430
communicate for the people to consume

1299
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,130
your report it helps them understand the

1300
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,080
process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> went into the numbers and</font>

that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I left good for me I left</font>

1305
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,540
like five minutes for questions

1306
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:53,840
so you mentioned the fun stuff that

1307
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,150
doesn't make the report because it

1308
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,940
failed the so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much test yeah favorite</font>

1309
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:03,320
serve items it was all the malware

1310
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:06,410
analysis we pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much a week slice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1311
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,940
dice specific malware names and we

1312
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,580
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what families were very</font>

1313
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,020
prominent we did a couple it did a

1314
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,940
couple more stuff with malware but it

1315
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:17,509
just didn't make it in yeah there was a

1316
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot around like so we talked about the</font>

1317
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,980
subsets of the data right and we talked

1318
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how not incident data its context</font>

1319
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,910
well part of the reason we put left the

1320
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:30,530
dried<font color="#E5E5E5"> X sub set in the overall data set</font>

1321
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,060
as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyzing it separately</font>

1322
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,640
was because when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1323
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,040
malware data you could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact of</font>

1324
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,640
dried X in it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1325
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,870
significant amount of a botnet data and

1326
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,779
what it really was was it was

1327
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:47,180
executables coming by email or infected

1328
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,880
malware infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> Word documents or</font>

1329
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,620
office documents coming by email and so

1330
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,540
you could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these BOTS were</font>

1331
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:56,990
actually happening significantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1332
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:58,160
helped inform us on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how we handled</font>

1333
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,109
the data and we had some really pretty

1334
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,910
cool pictures like they were all done we

1335
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,920
did him like up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the final quality and</font>

1336
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,149
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the final cut but</font>

1337
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,710
if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance to like see</font>

1338
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,290
either of our like actual dbr

1339
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,490
presentations like it's ours we they

1340
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,230
can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us not to use those figures</font>

1341
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:18,410
and we got them so like I got them all

1342
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:20,870
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation yes brother two quick</font>

1343
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:23,779
questions somewhat related you mentioned

1344
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,370
three different schemas yeah ah that's

1345
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,460
the first I've heard of multiple schemas

1346
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:30,500
when it comes to the analysis and the

1347
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,420
storage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data is this something</font>

1348
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,880
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this year's report or it does</font>

1349
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,860
know we only operate on a single one of

1350
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,720
those schemas we always use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dvir</font>

1351
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,340
esquina but there's there's some things

1352
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,740
like if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scheming and</font>

1353
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,110
notice there's a plus section and that

1354
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,209
plus section is marked to allow

1355
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,520
additional features in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the idea</font>

1356
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you as an organization have</font>

1357
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,190
things that are relevant to you but not

1358
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,170
to other people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put them in</font>

1359
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:57,020
there like we we used to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

1360
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,500
of pci data and so we have you know

1361
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,850
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> pci enumerations that really</font>

1362
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,950
aren't part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall schema but</font>

1363
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:06,500
that we have and then we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DVR</font>

1364
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,180
r 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB our year is actually a plus thing</font>

1365
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,790
it's in the DVR schema but it's not in

1366
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,529
the standard schema and the reason is

1367
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">because most people don't care about</font>

1368
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,280
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your the data was imported</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1369
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,439
DVR because they're not importing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1370
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,599
DVR and so it's just like little helper

1371
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,930
stuff like that that's specific to us so

1372
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,900
we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the DVR schema and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dbi</font>

1373
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:29,480
our schema is ninety-five percent the

1374
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,869
community schema that gets to my other

1375
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,470
questions have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you published what the</font>

1376
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:37,820
different schemas are and disclosed

1377
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:42,560
within the report a technical reading

1378
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists those differences so that as other</font>

1379
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,430
data scientists other analysts are

1380
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:52,030
taking a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the community schema</font>

1381
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:54,710
what's up on the community site they can

1382
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,900
reproduce your results using your

1383
00:52:54,710 --> 00:53:00,050
methods well should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be able</font>

1384
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:04,160
to reproduce so this gets back partially

1385
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data on because of the data sources</font>

1386
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,490
are agreements or that we are not

1387
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed to share the day like it if you</font>

1388
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,819
create any analysis on vc TB and send it

1389
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us we'll run it on our data set and</font>

1390
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:14,060
give you back the analysis but our

1391
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,490
agreements don't allow us to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1392
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,230
actual data and so ultimately there will

1393
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:20,868
never be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the perfect</font>

1394
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:23,510
reproducibility but I've got no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

1395
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:25,640
sharing the additional features that are

1396
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,660
in the DB our stuff we talked about it a

1397
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,069
lot you're going to be sorely

1398
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,899
disappointed there is nothing exciting

1399
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:31,759
in there all the cool stuff happens in

1400
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,410
the community schema like you know

1401
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,869
because really what people care about we

1402
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,098
call him<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forays right action in fact</font>

1403
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:39,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was in the scheme of thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1404
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:40,790
on the circles that's where ninety-nine

1405
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,859
percent of our parsing comes from and

1406
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:45,170
the stuff that gets in the plus section

1407
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:46,430
in fact unfortunately it's a lot of

1408
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,819
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they like kind of tried</font>

1409
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:51,259
they're like let's try to see if this

1410
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:53,540
feature gets coated in or we can fill

1411
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:56,900
stuff into it and it turns out no it

1412
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,579
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get used at all and so you even</font>

1413
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the plus section for other than like</font>

1414
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:03,170
the metadata ones like<font color="#E5E5E5"> dbr year it's</font>

1415
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just all columns and knows you don't</font>

1416
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,730
it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the schema but there's no actual</font>

1417
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:09,790
data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's no problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font>

1418
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:12,880
it you know it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really affect</font>

1419
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,620
share I don't so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

1420
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,260
what the best way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share it would be</font>

1421
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,759
because I don't on the various<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

1422
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,320
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I'm worried</font>

1423
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,120
about right because if I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the</font>

1424
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,820
various website now I've put two schemas

1425
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:26,529
two different schemas<font color="#E5E5E5"> side by side and I</font>

1426
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:28,690
don't want people looking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> going well</font>

1427
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,160
which one of these should i be using you

1428
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:32,080
know the cuete answer is you should be

1429
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,850
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community schema that one's</font>

1430
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,670
designed to meet the needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1431
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:39,310
community and if you use the additional

1432
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,360
features you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially we confuse</font>

1433
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,190
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we're not as good about</font>

1434
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping those additional ones as clean</font>

1435
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:47,590
as we do the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones like there's</font>

1436
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,940
some there's like some enumerations that

1437
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was cleaning it up this here and I'm</font>

1438
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,730
like hey why'd you got like what is this

1439
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,350
field why is this in here and they're

1440
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,060
like oh yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried that out like</font>

1441
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:57,490
three years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't work and</font>

1442
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,290
we never took it out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the private the</font>

1443
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,939
private schema and so I'd also be

1444
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:03,370
worried about confusing people but you

1445
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,430
know it I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be happy to email your you</font>

1446
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:08,470
know and I we've got a blog but it turns

1447
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:13,210
out that getting stuff on the blog is a

1448
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:15,490
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work and so there's got</font>

1449
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:18,490
to be some way maybe in the there's a DB

1450
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:20,229
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> or repo that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use to it's got all</font>

1451
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,240
the figures in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you didn't know</font>

1452
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,970
this last year we post all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the figures</font>

1453
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,040
there this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we posted the figures</font>

1454
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,529
plus the data behind the figures in an

1455
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,470
RDA file and then next year I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1456
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,250
try to see if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the validation</font>

1457
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:36,069
report in there but I could probably

1458
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">dump it in there I'll need to be</font>

1459
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:40,270
reminded I forget things very quickly

1460
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,070
but if you email me a DB are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bryson</font>

1461
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,360
com I'll make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure happens I'm just</font>

1462
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking this would go a long way</font>

1463
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,690
producing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the criticism that</font>

1464
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,040
they're important as continuity is

1465
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:52,220
especially this past year

1466
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,200
well but it wouldn't open this about the

1467
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:58,129
sausage I think this presentation is

1468
00:55:54,200 --> 00:56:00,200
great I think this should be shared

1469
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:02,090
partly sure if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll help i'd</font>

1470
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,339
be happy to do it yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1471
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:08,180
would produce a lot of mystical prizes

1472
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:10,540
got some of these reports yeah cool

1473
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,540
thank you
