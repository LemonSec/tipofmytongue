<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity research at the University</font>

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">and here's some pictures of some of the</font>

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,660
key people on the project somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font>

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,729
involved with those guys now Kate was

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,940
supposed to be here with me this would

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:40,370
have been her first hacker convention

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,050
talk she's done many i triple e type

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,849
speaking speaking engagements before she

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,430
was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited about being here her</font>

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,590
husband was much more exciting excited

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,570
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he crashed his bicycle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he needs</font>

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,660
to show the reconstructed or something

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,699
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate sends her regrets and I'm going</font>

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be responsible for her part 2 which</font>

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">is all the power stuff so it's going to</font>

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty cool but the research project</font>

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were on it was funded by arpa-e</font>

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">where at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of three years and at</font>

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,220
the end one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals that we had was</font>

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,439
we were going to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,780
software was going to have impact and in

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,798
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that I really pushed for</font>

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:28,250
open sourcing the engine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for</font>

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:31,020
cyber physical impact analysis and

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:34,860
primarily this was developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> for use in</font>

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,610
the power grid so the idea being how can

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ensure operational reliability and</font>

34
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,880
understand the impact of you know the

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,509
c-word or you know the network attack

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,079
surface around a large system that

37
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,880
provides power to many people and you

38
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,649
have more cyber security things than you

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take care of it how can you</font>

40
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,509
effectively prioritize those things so

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,880
your effort can be directed where it

42
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,639
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the greatest impact on</font>

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,099
reliability of operation because the

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,269
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated when you</font>

45
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,130
think about you know

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,570
there's internet connectivity come into

47
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate network and we've got all</font>

48
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,430
these little field devices and then you

49
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,010
got you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty hackers trying to go</font>

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,480
into substations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or there oh</font>

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,459
we're going to come in through the

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and attack the land so it's</font>

53
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:35,730
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large complex problem when</font>

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:39,600
you look at how do you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

55
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,890
together so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at adding</font>

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,070
on to traditional contingency analysis

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,320
because planners and electric operations

58
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,730
manually define contingencies like oh

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,730
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose this substation and</font>

60
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,799
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose this generator and</font>

61
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:02,640
they're like ecosystems or big things

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,530
within the power grid but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and then they automatically insert</font>

64
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,640
these things and they sent they simulate

65
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,260
the impact what would happen if you lost

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,480
that substation of that generator or

67
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,940
something big but it was always meant to

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,040
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like n minus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one criteria where</font>

69
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,410
we lose one substation what's going to

70
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,000
happen and then traditional contingency

71
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,310
analysis has always been that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way where</font>

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,290
we're going to we're going to plan

73
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,240
everything based around that thing but

74
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,970
the but what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you add this</font>

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,040
cyber on top where maybe it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:45,540
very you could simultaneously bring down

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,640
or provide a denial of service condition

78
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,090
to multiple locations and how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,649
plan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that short of yeah we can make</font>

80
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,720
a big giant black out but then there's

81
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,010
like middle ground between that like I

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,109
get five things happen at once what is

83
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,679
the contingency for that and previously

84
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,590
we couldn't do any computation with that

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,100
but newer more modern hardware has

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,739
giving up giving us the capability of

87
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,340
providing for much more fine-grained

88
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">infame</font>

89
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,760
about impact and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

90
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,350
research project was all about and

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,870
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the advent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of more modern</font>

92
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,010
communications in things like the power

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,690
grid you have this idea about the size

94
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,430
of the contingency list can just grow

95
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,710
very large if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a thousand a</font>

96
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,540
thousand lines and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 10-1 means</font>

97
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,919
you have a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> different criteria</font>

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,960
but you go out to n minus 2 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

99
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">take two things out then you're you're</font>

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,590
just getting really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big and so what do</font>

101
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,388
you do because when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at game</font>

102
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,630
theory and there's a lot of game theory

103
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,220
people on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our research project they</font>

104
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,860
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute everything and it got</font>

105
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,440
really really large fast and we're like

106
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,490
what we want to do is come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a way</font>

107
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the where we're going to be</font>

108
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,510
calculating and we do that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

109
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,810
get to it a little bit about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

110
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,659
part about we<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network attack surface</font>

111
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,250
to reduce the space of computations that

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,710
we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a ranked list of</font>

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,770
contingencies so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

114
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:28,200
things like the this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of</font>

115
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:31,109
the 2003 black out what the tool can do

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,020
is take all of the different physical

117
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,669
components that are inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

118
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,289
substation and then we map them map the

119
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,960
cyber and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> network of tap surface</font>

120
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:47,310
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we can provide a mapping</font>

121
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,780
so this is like normal and so when

122
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens there's a little bit</font>

123
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,090
of a disturbance and then depending on

124
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,110
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the piece of equipment is how long</font>

125
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it takes to clear the fault determines</font>

126
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,470
whether that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing would cascade</font>

127
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,220
beyond the bound of whatever it might be

128
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:10,010
and then if something bad happens we all

129
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,599
know that this was probably bad so

130
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,039
modern computing has allowed us instead

131
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,289
of it oh we lose this substation

132
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,710
something bad happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font>

133
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into an industrial facility after</font>

134
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,909
doing some of this inventory working I

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">will I always</font>

136
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">too I want to go in a sense nation and</font>

137
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,640
point at something I go I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

138
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,240
you know insisting have an IP address

139
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,919
how is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected on a network what</font>

140
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:41,340
would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact of this thing work</font>

141
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:45,690
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> misused and so the project tries</font>

142
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,369
to answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that question and this is kind</font>

143
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like a preview of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

144
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,020
ready to see this is what the front end

145
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,750
looks like and what you're able to

146
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">download now it was released four hours</font>

utilities ability to inventory and

149
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,620
analyze cyber physical assets so it

150
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,930
brings out first way if we have to do

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,060
work to collect the data from the

152
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,600
individual devices that make the power

153

158
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,250
as we did the research we came up with

159
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,720
use cases and like the first one a kind

160

of touched on a little bit with asset

161
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,200

fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> large or a medium</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sized what</font>

always been I always viewed as being

170
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,830
from the top down so we're going to look

171
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,440
at this substation and we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

172
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,200
do cyber-physical from the bottom up so

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">we look at all the individual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> components</font>

those assets and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be</font>

176
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,270
ranked in within like the threshold for

177
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,270
voltage stability which is like 15

178
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,430
minutes because utility will calculate

179
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,460
how they're doing every 15 minutes

180
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,110
typically so your<font color="#CCCCCC"> troll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> federal kind of</font>

list of what your top assets are and

186
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,420
then we calculate a cyber cost based on

187
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,450
network availability and vulnerability

188
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,490
scores from the ics-cert database so we

189
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,620
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust it and map data to come up</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this score and then there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

of the equipment in the on the power

194
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,810
side and then some of the other use

195
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,310
cases that came along as we were doing

196
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,469
this at utilities because we actually

197
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have deployed this software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at certain</font>

198
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:18,900

199
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,459
it attached a lot of things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

200
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know if I only have a limited amount</font>

201
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,520
of time to patch things which things

202
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,920
would get the best benefit of being

203
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,279
patched first so if you're able to

204
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:33,779
provide a ranked list of all your assets

205
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,520
you know which of the assets you should

206
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,400
patch first and is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little box</font>

207
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,390
in the tool it says I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> patched this</font>

208
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:46,439
asset then the tool recalculate the list

209
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,850
of top assets based on the fact that

210
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,680
you've patched certain assets you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

211
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,980
also keep track of which ones are

212
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,680
patched and not patched so hopefully

213
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will work in the demo not there's a</font>

214
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,750
screenshot of course so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is we</font>

215
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,400
have a network attack surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here</font>

216
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,900
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we can map the attacker and I</font>

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,819
don't know if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the mouse for</font>

218
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,829
the people online but on the left over

219
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,959
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the attack path and this is</font>

220
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,870
like a standard network attack surface

221
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,779
ton of<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph but we also can grab grasp</font>

222
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,339
that into a physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> one line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram so</font>

223
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,330
if the electrical engineer is here

224
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,230
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to tell you a lot more</font>

225
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:29,940
but I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even as a cyber security guy</font>

226
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,740
126 percent is bad so the guy gets in on

227
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,080
that device that line goes to one

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,089
hundred twenty six percent and in the

229
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,080
animation that that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually can run</font>

230
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,700
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not going to do it</font>

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,900
today it causes a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackout so the</font>

232
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,079
other thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool if you</font>

233
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:51,150
think about it is aggregate exposure so

234
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:54,300
how many you know Willie's 385

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have in all my stuff because if</font>

236
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,030
there's a vulnerability and a certain

237
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,160
revision level or model has a

238
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,860
vulnerability what happens if the elbow

239
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:11,780
out at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font>

240
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:16,350
model that now so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a way to just</font>

241
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,959
select or show how many of each

242
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,700
different thing you have and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

243
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,960
impact would be if those things were to

244
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">go down and then this then leads into</font>

245
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,410
another case we got from actually

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,970
utility feedback because they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

247
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,040
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do cyber incident planning</font>

248
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,180
where they wanted to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to come up</font>

249
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,250
with more realistic cases of a cyber

250
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,920
incident and then what could they do to

251
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:47,010
plan to make for a more reliable system

252
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,479
so the idea would be in the blackout you

253
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,470
know there were there were certain this

254
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,490
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual 2003 blackout in a power</font>

255
00:11:52,470 --> 00:12:00,960
flow diagram and then if you had a way

256
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to map all the individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components you</font>

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,480
could show the where the most important

258
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,560
things were and then the impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

259
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,810
event like we should we showed before

260
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,750
and this piece probably have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

261
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,420
better if Kate was here but this is the

262
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,880
transient stability problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> where within</font>

263
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">five milliseconds if the fault doesn't</font>

264
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,870
clear there's a problem so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

265
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,150
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components and</font>

266
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,110
determine which ones have this 5

267
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,660
millisecond threshold exceeded which

268
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,040
would mean that it would impact devices

269
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,600
around it and that could perhaps get

270
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,490
larger and then and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course</font>

271
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,570
another this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you're going to get</font>

272
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:45,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a download and we'll see if the demo</font>

273
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,300
actually works later but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

274
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,250
aggregate exposure like I said before so

275
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,569
if i wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in and there were</font>

276
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,820
three different things in common so i

277
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,040
can have a multiple pathways coming at

278
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,600
and we can then<font color="#CCCCCC"> simulate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no now</font>

279
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,300
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even being an electrical</font>

280
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:09,149
engineer 114 142<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

281
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:18,829
bad so and then this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a just a power</font>

282
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:21,779
world flow diagram and an attacker to

283
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:24,209
threat models an attacker I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

284
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,220
the word attack but the academic side

285
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,920
worth I work with love the word attack

286
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:33,450
so I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove the word</font>

287
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,939
attack as much as possible hmm what

288
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">would I call it instead a day that ends</font>

289
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:44,910
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y so the question was how how would I</font>

290
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,529
how would I call the instead of the word

291
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,829
attack what would I use I would say it's

292
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:54,390
just a day that ends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y so things</font>

293
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:57,269
happen and if there's some multiple if

294
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,519
you have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in common amongst</font>

295
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,589
things it's not really a until now that

296
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,980
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really weight effectively model</font>

297
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:07,079
this and so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

298
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,670
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really working on is how do you</font>

299
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,359
visualize these things because there's a

300
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:16,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of junk in in this and it's a very</font>

301
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,510
hard problem just in visualization so

302
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the first thing is if you go to</font>

303
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,209
this IP address this is actually live

304
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,100
right now you can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

305
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:27,869
took the I Triple E eight bus model and

306
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,279
then modeled all of the protective

307
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,209
relays and everything the distance

308
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,959
relays and you can see a cyber physical

309
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,869
representation of the I Triple E eight

310
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:42,149
bus model it's actually online<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

311
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:43,829
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gabe weaver c PTL and then we did</font>

312
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with him about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

313
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,510
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago cpt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> la</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber</font>

314
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,110
physical topology language and it's in

315
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,360
the plumbing of the engine so it

316
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,430
provides us<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ontology so that we can</font>

317
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,079
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationship both from a</font>

318
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,870
cyber perspective and a physical

319
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,349
perspective of individual devices that

320
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,199
make up this system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

321
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,620
like all works together with with you

322
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,469
have you can use your network software

323
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,850
of your choice because there's a there's

324
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,920
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON format</font>

325
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,569
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little while and we have planning</font>

326
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,849
software and the engine is what's been

327
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:23,550
open source today you can put your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

328
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">impacts and network attack service and</font>

329
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:30,389
make your own rank lists and with the

330
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:36,149
whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal of the project could</font>

331
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:38,910
be grid reliability and it's been I

332
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,339
released it I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was eleven</font>

333
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,469
o'clock this morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> after we got the</font>

334
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,509
license attached to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which I</font>

335
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,680
noticed wasn't there was no license I'm

336
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,839
like on the phone like what wait a

337
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,870
minute maybe we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a license on</font>

338
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:56,759
this so it's open source under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ncsa</font>

339
00:15:51,870 --> 00:16:00,480
UIUC licensed license and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

340
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">was we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work to remove the dependency of</font>

341
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,550
any particular piece of commercial

342
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:08,639
software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a slide about that</font>

343
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,019
later the idea is and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of already</font>

344
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,329
kind of talked about this a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

345
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,240
the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections and the impact</font>

346
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:18,269
together are so I've got in the top here

347
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,079
the host may be compromised or line Kate

348
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:24,180
then line k is at risk and then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

349
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">all manifested back into what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

350
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,949
protection scheme at the substation and

351
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,699
in which individual device is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk</font>

352
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then what would the impact be if</font>

353
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:39,240
that device were compromised and then

354
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,350
with this critical clearing time we can

355
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,639
determine whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's going to</font>

356
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,170
be an issue because the plan will tell

357
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,170
you if it clears within<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

358
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:50,670
milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

359
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:54,709
now let's see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I</font>

360
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,819
remembered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn the porn off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on nine</font>

361
00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:00,660
because I was it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was waiting in the</font>

362
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:02,849
speaker room so this is that IP address

363
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,319
thing that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing that will provide</font>

364
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,439
the slide so that you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP</font>

365
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:12,959
address was but it's 72 dot whatever

366
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:15,630
that is it's up and this is actually

367
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,159
hopefully online so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually out</font>

368
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,309
on the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere so you can see</font>

369
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:22,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the visual representations of the</font>

370
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,829
eight bus model you can go online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

371
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,510
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> those by going that IP address</font>

372
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,290
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get me afterwards and then the</font>

373
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,500
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

374
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:35,909
is the actual tool which is right here

375
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:38,160
so when you download sites ax or

376
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,380
armadillo which is what it's called the

377
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,220
release is called armadillo you're going

378
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,610
to get a html5<font color="#CCCCCC"> front-end you need</font>

379
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:52,260
tornado and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python to run it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your on</font>

380
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,520
your machine and I can go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

381
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,680
start it but I actually went ahead and

382
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,480
loaded it I could show you later we'll

383
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,910
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing on time I think I'm</font>

384
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,560
talking really fast right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't</font>

385
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> champ starting it right now</font>

386
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,520
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all running and it might</font>

387
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,500
screw itself up because it does open up

388
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,050
a port inside your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

389
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:18,570
connect to like 55 55 so when I click on

390
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,870
sites analysis so if you have multiple

391
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,010
projects you can select those and

392
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,270
there's a folder structure for that and

393
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,740
so I can go in there and select that and

394
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:35,730
then the little visualization will

395
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,410
appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can view the cyber assets</font>

396
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,410
and then we can also view the physical

397
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:44,550
assets we get to one line diagrams and

398
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:47,730
then if I start this it kind of looks

399
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a ranked list</font>

400
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:56,520
of assets in the eight bus model so if i

401
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,420
click on different IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get</font>

402
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:04,020
the corresponding pass if it's still

403
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,550
working it was working because the

404
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,620
password up there or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can view the</font>

405
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,560
physical that's still working and then

406
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,719
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cyber connectivity in that</font>

407
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,790
specific location there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

408
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,270
of other features in the tool that's

409
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,540
been released today and that's let me go

410
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,540
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

411
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:31,249
there we go so there's also the other

412
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,879
visualization so we used III for

413
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:37,669
visualization and that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but</font>

414
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:41,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to look really</font>

415
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:43,309
really small on this video so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

416
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the eight bus model but if I click on</font>

417
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:48,019
individual substations I can then get we

418
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,989
have a tree view on the left and then we

419
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,940
can show the both the physical their big

420
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:55,219
from a planning perspective or one-line

421
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,049
diagram perspective assets and then or

422
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:59,330
click on individual things and the

423
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:01,789
network would come up or the network

424
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,699
elements or the cybersecurity the cyber

425
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:06,679
elements the network attack surface of

426
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:12,409
individual substations and then there's

427
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:17,239
also this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another tree view of the</font>

428
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:21,589
same C PTO based things once we get the

429
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:23,450
mapping of this relay is this IP address

430
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:25,309
it serves this function we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tie all</font>

431
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,379
those things together via ontologies and

432
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,089
then look at all of the different

433
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:30,978
components that make up the different

434
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:34,129
sub station so i can select any sub

435
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:35,659
station at random or if you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

436
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:38,830
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pick from the audience and</font>

437
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:42,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can show not if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there we go</font>

438
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,830
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> same so how about you pick one and</font>

439
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:49,070
we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it actually works till</font>

440
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,349
somebody how about have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brook okay</font>

441
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,830
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a half of rook</font>

442
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:57,109
substation and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

443
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,589
different cyber and physical components

444
00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:02,539
that are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that substation looks better</font>

445
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:09,428
on a if you have a bigger screen

446
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:09,429
obviously and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then get back here</font>

447
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,830
and then it kind of can get big and

448
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,860
here's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the d3 wall so we</font>

449
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:24,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a model that has 300</font>

450
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:28,110
substations in it and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 5,000</font>

451
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,170
devices so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 5,000 devices and d3</font>

452
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,000
kind of like starts to on itself so

453
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,490
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you wanted to zoom in it takes</font>

454
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,830
like 30 seconds so I could get all the

455
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,110
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

456
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">time even as fast as I'm talking right</font>

457
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,379
now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that much time but so</font>

458
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,150
it's kind of there but going back and

459
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,160
some of the other trees that we used

460
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,470
individualization really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped us put</font>

461
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,500
more information visually on the screen

462
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,360
because one of the things we learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

463
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the research going into utilities is</font>

464
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,570
that it seemed like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were more</font>

465
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,550
interested in the visualization than the

466
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,740
utility actually is because all they

467
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,510
really wanted was either<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV file or a</font>

468
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,550
list we want the list we want to see a

469
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">table and that's really where they</font>

470
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">always go back to the you know the home</font>

471
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:21,510
interface where we just go into not the

472
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:24,450
right one we go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and they want</font>

473
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">a nice table so they can see their top</font>

474
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,470
assets and this should be working

475
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,250
there we go they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see their list</font>

476
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,800
of assets and I think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I come down</font>

477
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:49,050
here and with the video kind of like

478
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:51,450
maybe see that now I can mark two things

479
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,510
I can do with the engine that are kind

480
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:58,770
of cool is that you can mark a host is

481
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:01,470
being patched so that you know which

482
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,970
ones haven't been patched yet just well

483
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,410
utility asked us for this but the other

484
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,590
thing I thought was really cool is I

485
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,890
could actually mark a host is being

486
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:14,040
compromised and then recalculate the

487
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,360
right path based on that and then you

488
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,300
can also go through and see the

489
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,169
vulnerabilities based on CD score for

490
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:25,379
each of the individual components that

491
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:28,050
have IP addresses we tie all that

492
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,850
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can also patch the</font>

493
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:34,830
mark the vulnerabilities as being

494
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:39,570
patched in and recalculate the the pass

495
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:43,169
and then did I forget anything I'll find

496
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,830
out when I go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this lies I think</font>

497
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,830
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

498
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,999
and yes there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is actually</font>

499
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:57,229
d3 so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eighth substation</font>

500
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:02,149
model and one of the things it's like

501
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:04,279
okay that looks like some kind of

502
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,349
blended salad so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to</font>

503
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,950
do when you have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these different</font>

504
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:12,080
devices and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

505
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on and we built the trees is</font>

506
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,978
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all the different</font>

507
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,408
devices but then how does this make

508
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:21,019
sense you add names do not put names in

509
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:22,519
these are all traditional visualization

510
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:24,769
problems which is why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a blend</font>

511
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:26,029
between you want a visualization you

512
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,830
have a smaller network that's going to

513
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,889
be fun especially from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source</font>

514
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,080
perspective because maybe you don't have

515
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">5000 devices one of the things that</font>

516
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,519
besides folks as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to come up</font>

517
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:40,429
with a way for I'm not a power guy how

518
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,399
can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this so the visualizations are</font>

519
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:45,919
are very mature and stable we've had we

520
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,139
had professional programmers working on

521
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,080
some of this some of the visualizations

522
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:57,019
and then you can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to the</font>

523
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:59,090
tables because you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of from</font>

524
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:02,809
just tables because people understand

525
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,340
either the name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the device or</font>

526
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:06,049
its IP address cyber guys are always

527
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at cyber security people</font>

528
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:09,158
look at the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and know what</font>

529
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,209
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and then like</font>

530
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,739
operator as long as thats for the name a

531
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,330
little casita name and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change</font>

532
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:17,210
these kind of things once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

533
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,220
everything into a database so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

534
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go and see if i forgot anything here</font>

535
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

536
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:27,820
so here's how you start the tool

537
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:43,040
so let me see not bad so when you go to

538
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:47,679
github and download armadillo you're

539
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,928
going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be running tornado it's</font>

540
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,000
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaking its head yeah yeah so</font>

541
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:56,059
then you all you're going to do is and

542
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,770
it's not start tornado it's I think it's

543
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,470
not it doesn't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's something</font>

544
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">else now so that that's that's wrong it</font>

545
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,980
says start<font color="#CCCCCC"> size' it doesn't say start</font>

546
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,690
tornado anymore but then it comes up

547
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,000
just like I showed you in the demo you

548
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,260
click on sipes analysis maybe I should

549
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">have looked at these slides before I</font>

550
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:19,400
tried to demo because I probably would

551
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:21,410
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done better click select and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then a</font>

552
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">bus analysis comes up a bunch of stuff</font>

553
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">starts to go in the background this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

554
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the engine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing its thing and then you</font>

555
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:33,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in and look at your ranked list</font>

556
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:35,270
of contingencies and then here's the the

557
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,550
list of assets and then we have this

558
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:40,250
like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security index is</font>

559
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:44,389
determined by the cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and the</font>

560
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:45,830
performance index and you want to

561
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">contact any of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will contact</font>

562
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,850
information there's been papers written

563
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,740
on some of the formulas behind the

564
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,540
performance index to decipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs and</font>

565
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,570
there's more papers being published

566
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:00,860
towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the year regarding</font>

567
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:03,290
this research and did that showed you

568
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,809
that there's the tree<font color="#CCCCCC"> view maybe it</font>

569
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,970
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit better in the slide</font>

570
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:09,290
where you can select out on a different

571
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,540
yard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shows the connection between</font>

572
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,820
a distance relays this is our attempt it

573
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,700
really better orbiting then we can get

574
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of d3 because it's so jumbled when</font>

575
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:25,880
you put a few hundred devices on a small

<font color="#E5E5E5">site's the engine and the web front in</font>

578
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,470
there can be used on things other than

579
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:37,790
the power grid and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before it</font>

580
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,220
there is a performance index JSON

581
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,940
template so you can make your own

582
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,670
performance index for

583
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:46,280
dividual devices and then build your own

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,800
network attack surface via that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the JSON</font>

585
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,600
provided in the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and use the</font>

586
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,770
engine and something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

587
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:03,050
offline mode and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like well</font>

588
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:04,580
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that so well The this</font>

589
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,169
is like literally something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

590
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,850
done last week because I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

591
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,380
insistent about having a standalone

592
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,629
product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would run without any</font>

593
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:15,680
proprietary information from commercial

594
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:17,990
products so Olivier calls it offline

595
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,820
mode so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to type</font>

596
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:24,380
offline in the command line he wrote

597
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:26,720
these up we had a Olivier was a he was a

598
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,110
we had him<font color="#CCCCCC"> on loan from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marine</font>

599

600
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,500
he calls it offline book so now it's

601
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,030
offline mode right now I don't know if

602
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to stay that way but it's</font>

603
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,530
actually in the command line so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

604
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:43,430
would do run<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of that eight bus buh</font>

605
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:47,389
buh offline and you can also change the

606
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:51,890
output in CP gen that CSV so that you

607
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:55,040
can pull your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own information in and opa</font>

608
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:59,090
he's not in America anymore he left last

609
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:02,000
week and but I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would want</font>

610
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">him to be in the talk so that's Olivia</font>

611
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,430
he really induct rated himself into

612
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:13,899
America while he was here and he was

613
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:18,770
amazed as of the of the soft drink so

614
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:22,520
sipes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is available github as of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 this</font>

615
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning there is the papers involved</font>

616
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,520
with some of them normalization half

617
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:32,140
analysis that we did at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Illinois</font>

618
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:35,570
website under<font color="#E5E5E5"> iti sites ax and then</font>

619
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">codigo is a company that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been formed</font>

to work on servicing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

621
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,590
kind of like with snort or something

622
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,590
like

623
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,830
where you want somebody to come in and

624
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:51,129
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and part of the arpa-e project</font>

625
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,990
was path to commercialization they

626
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted they want to see the research</font>

627
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:00,279
have impact so<font color="#CCCCCC"> codigo can kind of help</font>

628
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,720
with that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then Kate would have been</font>

629
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,159
happy to be here to talk to you about

630
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,049
this is going to this is her company and

631
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:10,779
my role at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the university is to help</font>

632
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:14,559
researchers have see their research have

633
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:16,090
impact and to perhaps have them start

634
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,428
companies and this is the second one

635
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:24,158
I've done at the University of Illinois

636
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:30,970
so I think that's it I had plenty of

637
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:34,840
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions who's going to add</font>

638
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,429
chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> restaurant I mandiant um so your</font>

639
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,490
model I'm an electrical engineer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

640
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:42,399
want a few okay so be gentle I'm a

641
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,429
hacker I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a right so I used to work</font>

642
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,428
for aunt<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reggie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I actually know</font>

643
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:51,760
matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> davis that's Kate's we went yeah</font>

644
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:55,090
he's he's okay yeah but he's not he's

645
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,760
not he's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy right now yeah yeah</font>

646
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:01,029
yeah so we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> school together a</font>

647
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,059
tech anyway my question is is I know it

648
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:07,120
focuses a lot on the relays and things

649
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,279
like that does this project also

650
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,678
included things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtu substation</font>

651
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,470
artis as a matter of fact it does that

652
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is you know we can map</font>

653
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:19,149
impact of anything inside the substation

654
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,240
because with the ontology is that way

655
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:26,918
the sexy things are the relays and sure

656
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,960
because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the greatest precision</font>

657
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,669
I need to be I need to understand what's

658
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,779
going to happen five milliseconds within

659
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">five milliseconds after something</font>

660
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:38,110
happens in a relay rtu goes out oh no we

661
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:40,120
don't have readings from this site the

662
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,129
grids not going to go down his different

663
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,049
different performance index but it can

664
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,220
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included but if you have 10,000</font>

665
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:47,020
things are going to get towards the

666
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,490
bottom oh yeah we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do risk ratings</font>

667
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,350
for every type of piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of equipment for</font>

668
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,720
relays I had to do them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Artie use</font>

669
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,059
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to include cyber at</font>

670
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,340
the time

671
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:58,700
time but we didn't have very many are to

672
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,110
use on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so if you have an</font>

673
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,120
older substation with a lot of

674
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:05,539
electromechanical relays but you have a

675
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,389
modern substation gateway are to you

676
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:11,090
with IP that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really good too</font>

677
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,678
yeah well the other thing is is the idea

678
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,999
behind we see this a lot out in the

679
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,710
field too because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been to a lot of</font>

680
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:21,470
utilities is that we can model serial or

681
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,990
like non-routable protocols because it's

682
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,419
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a relational map to us a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to</font>

683
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,970
be to get to see and it's much easier to

684
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:31,309
model then when we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at a</font>

685
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,490
larger utility it has maybe multiple

686
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:36,230
pathways and you can still map impact on

687
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,289
that but you lose like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't have</font>

688
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">an nmap there's no IP address so you</font>

689
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,799
have to adjust your cyber score because

690
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:44,450
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different like your cyber score</font>

691
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,700
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then because I can get</font>

692
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:50,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">access for that I own it right exactly</font>

693
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:53,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right thanks good question and would</font>

694
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,999
you be so kind of share with us if you

695
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the future to write like you know</font>

696
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:00,289
I guess what's next I mean I see that a

697
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,970
company has been founded I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

698
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:03,350
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I there's gonna be a lot you</font>

699
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,059
know you're expecting a lot more paper

700
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,209
to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know that there's a</font>

701
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:10,970
lot more publication but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

702
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,710
this gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used I mean is it gonna be</font>

703
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,070
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be shopped around to</font>

704
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,899
utilities and power industrial companies

705
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,668
I mean could you share a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

706
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:23,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how you're gonna what the approach</font>

707
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:28,429
is sure I can do that so I didn't want

708
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:31,490
this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a vendor pitch yeah so you</font>

709
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:33,499
know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out in wet we've been at</font>

710
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,429
what use the world meeting we're working

711
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:39,049
closely with planners we're with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big</font>

712
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:43,700
utility out and what we've actually

713
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:45,529
modeled the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Northwest with this and we</font>

714
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:49,039
need to transient stability studies and

715
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:50,600
critical clearing times for some of way

716
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,450
I don't want to miss because I think

717
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is live but for some of wet but</font>

718
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,940
it's possible to do all of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

719
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,440
would need to model it and so we're

720
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,929
actively involved in that kind of thing

721
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,580
on the

722
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,080
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fence but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a</font>

723
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:09,119
kadai go talk this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it talking about</font>

724
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,399
the engine we use this engine and and

725
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,169
what other people use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because some</font>

726
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the continued research that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

727
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:18,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be happening is in cyber because we</font>

728
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,558
can formally describe what's going to

729
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,770
happen in physical impact cyber is a

730
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,020
little behind we're about maybe a year

731
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,659
to two years behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside we can't</font>

732
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,270
formally described cyber the way we can

733
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,879
participa this and there's continued

734
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:37,770
research on this with some of the folks

735
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I flash their pictures up earlier</font>

736
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:44,549
anyway whatever no no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

737
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">be very careful about that</font>

738
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:56,009
right because when we were talking about

739
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,910
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do with the software</font>

740
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there was like you know I'd have to</font>

741
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,960
be very careful but when I say now

742
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,940
because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being recorded but you</font>

743
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,260
know we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be open source because</font>

744
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,869
we wanted to get it out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

745
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,930
it it makes a commercial pathway easier

746
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:15,060
because anybody else can go out and jump

747
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab this software now but we have a</font>

748
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,349
three year head start on you and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

749
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,750
how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and we've broken this</font>

750
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:24,270
thing a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> times before the web</font>

751
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,820
front end is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very stable you build your</font>

752
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,700
own impact models you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do this stuff</font>

753
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,950
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we're really this is also a</font>

754
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,189
call for volunteers this is a new open

755
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,700
source project let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this for</font>

756
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:42,349
the community the engine is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice</font>

757
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:45,868
and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved</font>

758
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:50,090
and so if i can ask a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

759
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:53,250
your cascading impact through the graph

760
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:55,890
first you maintain two graphs<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for</font>

761
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,570
you know reach ability know if you

762
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,118
compromise this to compromise this in

763
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,890
one for something like flowing you know

764
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,000
increases in power as you remove or add

765
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:08,160
yeah that's like dozen or is it a single

766
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,410
graph structure no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multiple graphs</font>

767
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,839
so you have the graph for the power

768
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,430
which is very formalized in many

769
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:17,099
different commercial applications

770
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,839
planning software which ever one you use

771
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,520
and we've built an interface so that if

772
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use power world you use</font>

773
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else yeah you can write to the</font>

774
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">XML and we can take in that impact data</font>

775
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:31,380
and on the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for network</font>

776
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:34,410
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell us we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

777
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,270
firewall rules or in the format that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

778
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSV sits in so you can push the two</font>

779
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,050
things together and I've completely

780
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:47,190
forgotten your question education<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

781
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:50,490
graph the graph so so yeah the it's more

782
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:52,530
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just graphs but the online mode for</font>

783
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,890
example what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can recalculate</font>

784
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:57,570
what this score is based on both the

785
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,859
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power grids always changing</font>

786
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,210
what's important in the power grid is

787
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,098
going to change depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what time</font>

788
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,349
day is yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> load moves all</font>

789
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,270
around and then your corresponding

790
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,920
whereas the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot spot is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on</font>

791
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:10,320
the cyber side<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because these are the</font>

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are more important okay and</font>

793
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,500
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I answered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your question</font>

794
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:18,869
it explains how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're flowing the</font>

795
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,020
cascading failures through to get impact

796
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">by yeah cuz there's a shock towers you</font>

797
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,339
know exceeded if if you had power world

798
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,589
there's a socket that's open in the

799
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,839
engine it talks directly with power

800
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:34,490
world and then when there's changes

801
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,839
power world<font color="#E5E5E5"> does transient stability</font>

802
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,490
analysis and it also does a critical

803
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,109
clearing time on the individual devices

804
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,020
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something we literally just</font>

805
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,970
finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> two weeks ago so we can we can</font>

806
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,230
provide a critical clearing time in

807
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:53,759
power world for individual relays now

808
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:56,010
the attack pass through the are you

809
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,770
modeling attack pass on the attacker

810
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,570
side is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know they got into this</font>

811
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:04,589
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this I can get into this or you</font>

812
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,060
more modeling just if they you know we

813
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:07,529
know that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to something</font>

814
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,839
an attacker could potentially touch and

815
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,780
therefore if it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down we see this</font>

816
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:17,640
and are you modeling failure modes other

817
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:19,349
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just availability yes so it's a</font>

818
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination we look at the firewall</font>

819
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:24,480
configuration so we get a reduced set of

820
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,300
network attack surface from that

821
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,400
availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then through nmap we</font>

822
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,000
can if you have n map data and we've

823
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,589
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual and mep scanning and we've</font>

824
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,660
artificially produced in map scanning to

825
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:38,310
interrogate the us-cert database so

826
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,379
these are the vulnerabilities that might

827
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,509
be on this system so if there is a

828
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,099
vulnerability that matches the software

829
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,780
that's in the system it's going to

830
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,250
percolate up on the list and this is

831
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,630
also something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be calculated</font>

832
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:54,980
over a period of time or iteratively is

833
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:57,030
that iteratively yes and so and then

834
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,670
you're determining when you're

835
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:04,020
prioritizing assets by likelihood an

836
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,900
impact are you just kind of using some

837
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,910
have 5 by 5 matrix for impact vs

838
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,530
likelihood how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you weighing those</font>

839
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,040
two together to get your single this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

840
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,060
the most important

841
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,509
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you combine those two orthogonal</font>

842
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:23,000
vectors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool there's a paper you</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it's it's it's the answer is</font>

844
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,150
longer than I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can sure get to right now</font>

845
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">but there's and it's also a research</font>

846
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,860
topic you know we make some decisions

847
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,990
about what formulas we use to come up

848
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">with these indexes we test them against</font>

849
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,319
the utilities that were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with</font>

theory and that was very empty problem

<font color="#E5E5E5">berryann be problematic and then we went</font>

861
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:06,980
to depth-first search and we've got a

862
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,569
lot of PhDs on this project lots of

863
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,790
papers were written about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it but</font>

864
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,470
it all came down to practically how do

865
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,870
you reduce the attack surface so that

866
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,209
it's big enough to calculate but then

867
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,859
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting because I reduce</font>

868
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,990
the attack surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to zero then we</font>

869
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,670
can calculate everything season so you

870
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,919
got to find out there's a middle ground

871
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,080
in there somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the more</font>

872
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,840
people that use this we can find how<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

873
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,970
can we take today's electronics because

874
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think we can get much further now than</font>

875
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:36,740
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years ago but no work has</font>

876
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,350
really been done on modernizing this

877
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:45,270
kind of planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that's a</font>

878
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:51,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question thank you so</font>

879
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,980
anybody else so thanks I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

880
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,390
maybe the electrical engineering part

881
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,350
would have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little longer if Kate</font>

882
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:00,240
had actually come and appreciate

883
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,610
everybody's attention and just go out

884
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and tell us what we</font>

885
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,190
did wrong thank you
